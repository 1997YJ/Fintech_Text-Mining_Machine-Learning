references in
this discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to
exxonmobil (u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement.  unless
otherwise indicated, references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and
corporate and financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's
share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
 
 
review of second quarter 2013 results 
 
exxonmobil’s results for the
second quarter of 2013 reflect continued strong operational performance and
investments to meet growing demand for oil, natural gas and chemical products
in the years ahead.
 
second quarter
earnings were $6.9 billion, down 57 percent from the second quarter of 2012. 
excluding the prior year net gain of $7.5 billion associated with divestments
and tax-related items, earnings were down 19 percent.  weaker refining margins
and volumes associated with planned refinery turnaround and maintenance
activities negatively impacted downstream earnings.
 
in the second
quarter, capital and exploration expenditures were $10.2 billion, in line with
anticipated spending plans. 
 
the
corporation distributed $6.8 billion to shareholders in the second quarter
through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.



 


 


 



 
earnings in the first six months
of 2013 of $16,360 million decreased $9,000 million from 2012.
 
earnings per
share – assuming dilution for the first six months of 2013 decreased 32 percent
to $3.67.

upstream earnings were
$6,305 million in the second quarter of 2013, down $2,053 million
from the second quarter of 2012.  higher natural gas realizations, partially
offset by lower liquids realizations, increased earnings by $90 million,
while lower volumes reduced earnings by $70 million.  all other items reduced
earnings by about $2.1 billion, primarily reflecting the absence of a prior
year gain in angola and higher operating expenses, including reimbursement of
past exploratory costs to rosneft for the black sea and kara sea joint
ventures.
 
on an oil-equivalent
basis, production decreased 1.9 percent from the second quarter of 2012. 
excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, opec quota effects and
divestments, production was essentially flat.
 
liquids
production totaled 2,182 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 26 kbd
from the second quarter of 2012.  excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes,
opec quota effects and divestments, liquids production was flat, as field
decline was offset by project ramp-up and lower downtime.
 
second quarter
natural gas production was 11,354 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day),
down 307 mcfd from 2012.  excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and
divestments, natural gas production was flat, as field decline was offset by
higher demand, lower downtime and project ramp-up.
 
earnings from
u.s. upstream operations were $1,096 million, $418 million higher
than the second quarter of 2012.  non‑u.s. upstream earnings were $5,209
million, down $2,471 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream earnings in the first six
months of 2013 were $13,342 million, down $2,818 million from 2012.  lower
liquids realizations, partially offset by higher gas realizations, reduced
earnings by $140 million.  lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $340
million.  all other items, including lower net gains on asset sales, mainly in
angola, and higher expenses, reduced earnings by $2.3 billion. 
 
on an
oil-equivalent basis, production was down 2.7 percent compared to the same
period in 2012.  excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, opec quota
effects and divestments, production was down 0.9 percent.
 
liquids
production of 2,188 kbd decreased 23 kbd compared with 2012.  excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes, opec quota effects and divestments, liquids
production was down 0.9 percent, as field decline was partly offset by project
ramp‑up and lower downtime. 
 
natural gas
production of 12,278 mcfd decreased 571 mcfd from 2012.  excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was
down 0.9 percent, with field decline partly offset by higher demand, lower
downtime and project ramp-up.
 
earnings in the
first six months of 2013 from u.s. upstream operations were
$1,955 million, up $267 million from 2012.  earnings outside the u.s.
were $11,387 million, down $3,085 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of
exxonmobil’s entitlement volume effects.  these descriptions are provided to
facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
production
sharing contract (psc) net interest reductions are contractual reductions
in exxonmobil’s share of production volumes covered by pscs. these reductions
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve thresholds as specified in the pscs. once a net interest reduction has
occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower
crude oil prices.
 
price and
spend impacts on volumes are fluctuations in exxonmobil’s share of
production volumes caused by changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels
from one period to another.  for example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are
required for exxonmobil to recover its costs. according to the terms of
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending
variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes
attributable to exxonmobil. these effects generally vary from period to period
with field spending patterns or market prices for crude oil or natural gas.

second quarter 2013 downstream
earnings were $396 million, down $6,250 million from the second
quarter of 2012, due primarily to the absence of the $5.3 billion gain
associated with the japan restructuring.  weaker margins, mainly in refining,
decreased earnings by $510 million.  volume and mix effects decreased earnings
by $370 million, due primarily to higher planned maintenance.  all other items,
primarily higher expenses, decreased earnings by $70 million.  petroleum
product sales of 5,765 kbd were 406 kbd lower than last year's second
quarter reflecting the japan restructuring and other divestment-related
impacts. 
 
earnings from
the u.s. downstream were $248 million, down $586 million from the
second quarter of 2012.  non-u.s. downstream earnings of $148 million were
$5,664 million lower than last year.  



 


 


 



 
downstream earnings in the first
six months of 2013 of $1,941 million decreased $6,291 million from 2012
driven by the absence of the $5.3 billion gain associated with the japan
restructuring.  higher margins increased earnings by $230 million, while volume
and mix effects decreased earnings by $640 million.  all other items, including
higher operating expenses and lower divestments, decreased earnings by $580
million.  petroleum product sales of 5,760 kbd decreased 483 kbd from
2012.
 
u.s.
downstream earnings in the first six months of 2013 were $1,287 million,
down $150 million from 2012.  non‑u.s. downstream earnings were $654
million, a decrease of $6,141 million from last year.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
  
cash
flow from operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2013 of $8.0
billion, including asset sales of $0.3 billion, decreased $6.0 billion from the
comparable 2012 period.  lower proceeds from asset sales, driven by the 2012
japan restructuring, and the timing of tax payments accounted for the majority
of the cash flow decrease.  
 
cash provided by operating activities totaled $21.3
billion for the first six months of 2013, $8.2 billion lower than 2012. the
major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of
$16.7 billion, a decrease of $10.7 billion from the prior year period.  the
adjustment for the noncash provision of $8.5 billion for depreciation and
depletion increased by $0.8 billion.  changes in operational working capital decreased
cash flows by $3.0 billion in 2013, primarily due to an increase in inventory. 
changes in operational working capital increased cash flows by $3.4 billion in
2012 primarily due to changes in payable and receivable balances.  net gain on
asset sales was $0.4 billion in 2013 and $11.1 billion in 2012.  all other
items net in 2013 decreased cash by $0.7 billion versus an increase of $2.0
billion in 2012.  for additional details, see the condensed consolidated
statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities for the first six months of 2013
used net cash of $18.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion compared to the
prior year.  spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $16.1
billion was flat with 2012.  proceeds from asset sales of $0.7 billion decreased
$5.6 billion.  additional investment and advances increased $3.2 billion to
$3.5 billion reflecting the impact of the acquisition of celtic exploration ltd.
 
cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first
six months of 2013 of $21.9 billion, including asset sales of $0.7 billion,
decreased $13.8 billion.  this reflects the change in cash flows from operating
activities described above and the lower proceeds from asset sales, driven by
the 2012 japan restructuring.  
 
net cash used in financing activities of $7.4 billion
in the first six months of 2013 was $7.9 billion lower than 2012, reflecting short-term
debt issuance in 2013.  
 
during the second quarter of 2013, exxon mobil
corporation purchased 45 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at
a gross cost of $4.0 billion.  these purchases were to reduce the number of
shares outstanding.  shares outstanding decreased from 4,446 million at the end
of first quarter to 4,402 million at the end of the second quarter 2013.  purchases
may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

the
corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $6.8 billion in the second
quarter of 2013 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding.
 
total cash and
cash equivalents of $5.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2013
compared to $18.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2012.
 
total debt of
$19.4 billion compared to $11.6 billion at year-end 2012.  the corporation's
debt to total capital ratio was 10.1 percent at the end of the second quarter
of 2013 compared to 6.3 percent at year-end 2012.  
 
although the corporation issues long-term debt from time to time, the
corporation currently expects to cover its near-term financial requirements
predominantly with internally generated funds, supplemented by its revolving
commercial paper program.
 
the corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program,
continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.  because of the
ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time
to time which will result in either gains or losses.  additionally, the
corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business
portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such
transactions from time to time.  key criteria for evaluating acquisitions
include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. 
acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s common stock,
or both.  
 
litigation and
other contingencies are discussed in note 2 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

the higher effective tax rate.  the effective income tax rate was 51 percent
compared to 36 percent in the prior year period, due
to the absence of the lower effective tax rate on divestments.  sales-based
taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by $1.5 billion to $16.5 billion
reflecting the japan restructuring.

references in
this discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to
exxonmobil (u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement.  unless
otherwise indicated, references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and
corporate and financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's
share after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
 
 
review of second quarter 2013 results 
 
exxonmobil’s results for the
second quarter of 2013 reflect continued strong operational performance and
investments to meet growing demand for oil, natural gas and chemical products
in the years ahead.
 
second quarter
earnings were $6.9 billion, down 57 percent from the second quarter of 2012. 
excluding the prior year net gain of $7.5 billion associated with divestments
and tax-related items, earnings were down 19 percent.  weaker refining margins
and volumes associated with planned refinery turnaround and maintenance
activities negatively impacted downstream earnings.
 
in the second
quarter, capital and exploration expenditures were $10.2 billion, in line with
anticipated spending plans. 
 
the
corporation distributed $6.8 billion to shareholders in the second quarter
through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.



 


 


 



 
earnings in the first six months
of 2013 of $16,360 million decreased $9,000 million from 2012.
 
earnings per
share – assuming dilution for the first six months of 2013 decreased 32 percent
to $3.67.

upstream earnings were
$6,305 million in the second quarter of 2013, down $2,053 million
from the second quarter of 2012.  higher natural gas realizations, partially
offset by lower liquids realizations, increased earnings by $90 million,
while lower volumes reduced earnings by $70 million.  all other items reduced
earnings by about $2.1 billion, primarily reflecting the absence of a prior
year gain in angola and higher operating expenses, including reimbursement of
past exploratory costs to rosneft for the black sea and kara sea joint
ventures.
 
on an oil-equivalent
basis, production decreased 1.9 percent from the second quarter of 2012. 
excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, opec quota effects and
divestments, production was essentially flat.
 
liquids
production totaled 2,182 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 26 kbd
from the second quarter of 2012.  excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes,
opec quota effects and divestments, liquids production was flat, as field
decline was offset by project ramp-up and lower downtime.
 
second quarter
natural gas production was 11,354 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day),
down 307 mcfd from 2012.  excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and
divestments, natural gas production was flat, as field decline was offset by
higher demand, lower downtime and project ramp-up.
 
earnings from
u.s. upstream operations were $1,096 million, $418 million higher
than the second quarter of 2012.  non‑u.s. upstream earnings were $5,209
million, down $2,471 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream earnings in the first six
months of 2013 were $13,342 million, down $2,818 million from 2012.  lower
liquids realizations, partially offset by higher gas realizations, reduced
earnings by $140 million.  lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $340
million.  all other items, including lower net gains on asset sales, mainly in
angola, and higher expenses, reduced earnings by $2.3 billion. 
 
on an
oil-equivalent basis, production was down 2.7 percent compared to the same
period in 2012.  excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes, opec quota
effects and divestments, production was down 0.9 percent.
 
liquids
production of 2,188 kbd decreased 23 kbd compared with 2012.  excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes, opec quota effects and divestments, liquids
production was down 0.9 percent, as field decline was partly offset by project
ramp‑up and lower downtime. 
 
natural gas
production of 12,278 mcfd decreased 571 mcfd from 2012.  excluding
the impacts of entitlement volumes and divestments, natural gas production was
down 0.9 percent, with field decline partly offset by higher demand, lower
downtime and project ramp-up.
 
earnings in the
first six months of 2013 from u.s. upstream operations were
$1,955 million, up $267 million from 2012.  earnings outside the u.s.
were $11,387 million, down $3,085 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of
exxonmobil’s entitlement volume effects.  these descriptions are provided to
facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
production
sharing contract (psc) net interest reductions are contractual reductions
in exxonmobil’s share of production volumes covered by pscs. these reductions
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve thresholds as specified in the pscs. once a net interest reduction has
occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower
crude oil prices.
 
price and
spend impacts on volumes are fluctuations in exxonmobil’s share of
production volumes caused by changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels
from one period to another.  for example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are
required for exxonmobil to recover its costs. according to the terms of
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending
variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes
attributable to exxonmobil. these effects generally vary from period to period
with field spending patterns or market prices for crude oil or natural gas.

second quarter 2013 downstream
earnings were $396 million, down $6,250 million from the second
quarter of 2012, due primarily to the absence of the $5.3 billion gain
associated with the japan restructuring.  weaker margins, mainly in refining,
decreased earnings by $510 million.  volume and mix effects decreased earnings
by $370 million, due primarily to higher planned maintenance.  all other items,
primarily higher expenses, decreased earnings by $70 million.  petroleum
product sales of 5,765 kbd were 406 kbd lower than last year's second
quarter reflecting the japan restructuring and other divestment-related
impacts. 
 
earnings from
the u.s. downstream were $248 million, down $586 million from the

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
  
cash
flow from operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2013 of $8.0
billion, including asset sales of $0.3 billion, decreased $6.0 billion from the
comparable 2012 period.  lower proceeds from asset sales, driven by the 2012
japan restructuring, and the timing of tax payments accounted for the majority
of the cash flow decrease.  
 
cash provided by operating activities totaled $21.3
billion for the first six months of 2013, $8.2 billion lower than 2012. the
major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of
$16.7 billion, a decrease of $10.7 billion from the prior year period.  the
adjustment for the noncash provision of $8.5 billion for depreciation and
depletion increased by $0.8 billion.  changes in operational working capital decreased
cash flows by $3.0 billion in 2013, primarily due to an increase in inventory. 
changes in operational working capital increased cash flows by $3.4 billion in
2012 primarily due to changes in payable and receivable balances.  net gain on
asset sales was $0.4 billion in 2013 and $11.1 billion in 2012.  all other
items net in 2013 decreased cash by $0.7 billion versus an increase of $2.0
billion in 2012.  for additional details, see the condensed consolidated
statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities for the first six months of 2013
used net cash of $18.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion compared to the
prior year.  spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $16.1
billion was flat with 2012.  proceeds from asset sales of $0.7 billion decreased
$5.6 billion.  additional investment and advances increased $3.2 billion to
$3.5 billion reflecting the impact of the acquisition of celtic exploration ltd.
 
cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first
six months of 2013 of $21.9 billion, including asset sales of $0.7 billion,
decreased $13.8 billion.  this reflects the change in cash flows from operating
activities described above and the lower proceeds from asset sales, driven by
the 2012 japan restructuring.  
 
net cash used in financing activities of $7.4 billion
in the first six months of 2013 was $7.9 billion lower than 2012, reflecting short-term
debt issuance in 2013.  
 
during the second quarter of 2013, exxon mobil
corporation purchased 45 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at
a gross cost of $4.0 billion.  these purchases were to reduce the number of
shares outstanding.  shares outstanding decreased from 4,446 million at the end
of first quarter to 4,402 million at the end of the second quarter 2013.  purchases
may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

the
corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $6.8 billion in the second
quarter of 2013 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding.
 
total cash and
cash equivalents of $5.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2013
compared to $18.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2012.
 
total debt of
$19.4 billion compared to $11.6 billion at year-end 2012.  the corporation's
debt to total capital ratio was 10.1 percent at the end of the second quarter
of 2013 compared to 6.3 percent at year-end 2012.  
 
although the corporation issues long-term debt from time to time, the
corporation currently expects to cover its near-term financial requirements
predominantly with internally generated funds, supplemented by its revolving
commercial paper program.
 
the corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program,
continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.  because of the
ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time
to time which will result in either gains or losses.  additionally, the
corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business
portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such
transactions from time to time.  key criteria for evaluating acquisitions
include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. 
acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s common stock,
or both.  
 
litigation and
other contingencies are discussed in note 2 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

to the absence of the lower effective tax rate on divestments.  sales-based
taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by $1.5 billion to $16.5 billion
reflecting the japan restructuring.
