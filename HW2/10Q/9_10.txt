references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and
financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of second quarter 2015 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
second quarter 2015 earnings were $4.2 billion, or
$1 per diluted share, compared with $8.8 billion a year earlier.
higher downstream and chemical earnings were more than offset by the impact of
weaker upstream realizations and lower asset management gains.
 
exxonmobil
is delivering on its investment and operating commitments across the integrated
portfolio. quarterly results reflect the disparate impacts of the current
commodity price environment, but also demonstrate the strength of our sound
operations, superior project execution capabilities, as well as continued
discipline in capital and expense management.
 
exxonmobil
produced 4 million oil‑equivalent barrels per day, an increase of
139,000 barrels per day, or 3.6 percent. liquids volumes of
2.3 million barrels per day increased 11.9 percent, benefiting from
new developments in angola, canada, indonesia and the united states.  



 


 


 



 
earnings
in the first six months of 2015 were $9.1 billion, down $8.8 billion
or 49 percent from 2014.
 
earnings
per share, assuming dilution, decreased 48 percent to $2.17.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $16 billion, down 12 percent from
2014.
 
oil
equivalent production increased 3 percent from 2014, with liquids up
8.9 percent and natural gas down 3.6 percent.
 
the
corporation distributed $8 billion to shareholders in the first half of
2015 through $6 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.

upstream
earnings were $2,031 million in the second quarter of 2015, down
$5,850 million from the second quarter of 2014. lower liquids and gas
realizations decreased earnings by $4.5 billion, while volume effects
increased earnings by $330 million driven by new developments. all other
items decreased earnings by $1.7 billion, including the one‑time
$260 million deferred income tax impact related to the tax rate increase in
alberta, canada, and the absence of prior year asset management gains.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production increased 3.6 percent from the
second quarter of 2014. liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per
day, up 243,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects partly offset by field decline. natural gas production was
10.1 billion cubic feet per day, down 622 million cubic feet per day
from 2014 due to regulatory restrictions in the netherlands. project volumes
and entitlement effects offset field decline.
 
the
u.s. upstream operations recorded a loss of $47 million, down
$1,240 million from the second quarter of 2014. non‑u.s. upstream
earnings were $2,078 million, down $4,610 million from the prior
year.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings for the first six months of 2015 were $4,886 million, down
$10,778 million from 2014. lower realizations decreased earnings by
$10 billion. favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$570 million. all other items, primarily the absence of prior year asset
management gains, decreased earnings by $1.4 billion.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4.1 million barrels per day
was up 3 percent compared to the same period in 2014. liquids production
of 2.3 million barrels per day increased 186,000 barrels per day,
with project ramp‑up and entitlement effects partly offset by field
decline. natural gas production of 11 billion cubic feet per day decreased
407 million cubic feet per day from 2014 due to regulatory restrictions in
the netherlands. project ramp‑up and entitlement effects exceeded field
decline.
 
the
u.s. upstream operations recorded a loss of $99 million, down
$2,536 million from 2014. non‑u.s. earnings were
$4,985 million, down $8,242 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2015 was $9.4 billion,
including asset sales of $0.6 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the
comparable 2014 period due to lower earnings and lower proceeds from asset
sales.
 
cash provided by operating
activities totaled $16.8 billion for the first six months of 2015, $8.5 billion
lower than 2014. the major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $9.3 billion, a decrease of $9.2 billion from the prior year
period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $8.8 billion for
depreciation and depletion increased by $0.3 billion. changes in operational
working capital decreased cash flows by $1.5 billion in 2015. all other items
net increased cash by $0.2 billion in 2015 and decreased cash by $1.7 billion
in 2014. for additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of
cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first six months of 2015 used net cash of $12.8 billion, an increase of
$2.4 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $14 billion was $1.9 billion lower than 2014. proceeds
from asset sales of $1.1 billion decreased $2.6 billion. additional investment
and advances decreased $0.3 billion to $0.4 billion. other investing activities
– net decreased $2 billion to $0.4 billion.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2015 was $17.9 billion, including
asset sales of $1.1 billion, and decreased $11.1 billion from the comparable
2014 period primarily due to lower earnings and lower proceeds from asset
sales.
 
during the first
quarter of 2015, the corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt and used
part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used in financing
activities of $4.0 billion in the first six months of 2015 was $9.4 billion lower
than 2014 reflecting the 2015 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of exxonmobil stock in 2015.
  
during the second
quarter of 2015, exxon mobil corporation purchased 12 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1.0 billion. these purchases
were to reduce the number of shares outstanding. shares outstanding decreased
from 4,181 million at the end of first quarter to 4,169 million at the end of
the second quarter 2015. purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.


19  



 

the corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $4.1
billion in the second quarter of 2015 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015 compared
to $6.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2014.
 
total debt of $33.8
billion compared to $29.1 billion at year-end 2014. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 15.9 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2015
compared to 13.9 percent at year-end 2014.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s
common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

decreased by $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 45 percent compared to 41 percent in the prior year period due primarily to
unfavorable tax rate change impacts. sales-based
taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by $3.6 billion to $13.6 billion
as a result of lower sales realizations.



 


 


 



 
income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $30.6 billion for the first
six months of 2015, a decrease of $13.7 billion from 2014. income tax expense
decreased by $6.6 billion to $4.3 billion as a result of lower earnings and a
lower effective tax rate. the effective income tax rate was 39 percent compared
to 43 percent in the prior year due primarily to a lower share of earnings in
higher tax jurisdictions. sales-based and all other taxes decreased by $7.1
billion to $26.4 billion as a result of lower sales
realizations.

capital and exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2015
were $8.3 billion, down 16 percent from the second quarter of 2014, in line
with plan.



 


 


 



 
capital
and exploration expenditures in the first six months of 2015 were $16.0
billion, down 12 percent from the first six months of 2014 due primarily
to lower major project spending. the corporation anticipates an average
investment profile of about $34 billion per year for
the next few years. actual spending could vary depending on the progress of
individual projects and property acquisitions.
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
expected to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements.

review
of second quarter 2015 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
second quarter 2015 earnings were $4.2 billion, or
$1 per diluted share, compared with $8.8 billion a year earlier.
higher downstream and chemical earnings were more than offset by the impact of
weaker upstream realizations and lower asset management gains.
 
exxonmobil
is delivering on its investment and operating commitments across the integrated
portfolio. quarterly results reflect the disparate impacts of the current
commodity price environment, but also demonstrate the strength of our sound
operations, superior project execution capabilities, as well as continued
discipline in capital and expense management.
 
exxonmobil
produced 4 million oil‑equivalent barrels per day, an increase of
139,000 barrels per day, or 3.6 percent. liquids volumes of
2.3 million barrels per day increased 11.9 percent, benefiting from
new developments in angola, canada, indonesia and the united states.  



 


 


 



 
earnings
in the first six months of 2015 were $9.1 billion, down $8.8 billion
or 49 percent from 2014.
 
earnings
per share, assuming dilution, decreased 48 percent to $2.17.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $16 billion, down 12 percent from
2014.
 
oil
equivalent production increased 3 percent from 2014, with liquids up
8.9 percent and natural gas down 3.6 percent.
 
the
corporation distributed $8 billion to shareholders in the first half of
2015 through $6 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.

upstream
earnings were $2,031 million in the second quarter of 2015, down
$5,850 million from the second quarter of 2014. lower liquids and gas
realizations decreased earnings by $4.5 billion, while volume effects
increased earnings by $330 million driven by new developments. all other
items decreased earnings by $1.7 billion, including the one‑time
$260 million deferred income tax impact related to the tax rate increase in
alberta, canada, and the absence of prior year asset management gains.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production increased 3.6 percent from the
second quarter of 2014. liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per
day, up 243,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects partly offset by field decline. natural gas production was
10.1 billion cubic feet per day, down 622 million cubic feet per day
from 2014 due to regulatory restrictions in the netherlands. project volumes
and entitlement effects offset field decline.
 
the
u.s. upstream operations recorded a loss of $47 million, down
$1,240 million from the second quarter of 2014. non‑u.s. upstream
earnings were $2,078 million, down $4,610 million from the prior
year.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings for the first six months of 2015 were $4,886 million, down
$10,778 million from 2014. lower realizations decreased earnings by
$10 billion. favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$570 million. all other items, primarily the absence of prior year asset
management gains, decreased earnings by $1.4 billion.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4.1 million barrels per day
was up 3 percent compared to the same period in 2014. liquids production
of 2.3 million barrels per day increased 186,000 barrels per day,
with project ramp‑up and entitlement effects partly offset by field
decline. natural gas production of 11 billion cubic feet per day decreased
407 million cubic feet per day from 2014 due to regulatory restrictions in
the netherlands. project ramp‑up and entitlement effects exceeded field
decline.
 
the
u.s. upstream operations recorded a loss of $99 million, down
$2,536 million from 2014. non‑u.s. earnings were
$4,985 million, down $8,242 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2015 was $9.4 billion,
including asset sales of $0.6 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the
comparable 2014 period due to lower earnings and lower proceeds from asset
sales.
 
cash provided by operating
activities totaled $16.8 billion for the first six months of 2015, $8.5 billion
lower than 2014. the major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $9.3 billion, a decrease of $9.2 billion from the prior year
period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $8.8 billion for
depreciation and depletion increased by $0.3 billion. changes in operational
working capital decreased cash flows by $1.5 billion in 2015. all other items
net increased cash by $0.2 billion in 2015 and decreased cash by $1.7 billion
in 2014. for additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of
cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first six months of 2015 used net cash of $12.8 billion, an increase of
$2.4 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $14 billion was $1.9 billion lower than 2014. proceeds
from asset sales of $1.1 billion decreased $2.6 billion. additional investment
and advances decreased $0.3 billion to $0.4 billion. other investing activities
– net decreased $2 billion to $0.4 billion.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2015 was $17.9 billion, including
asset sales of $1.1 billion, and decreased $11.1 billion from the comparable
2014 period primarily due to lower earnings and lower proceeds from asset
sales.
 
during the first
quarter of 2015, the corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt and used
part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used in financing
activities of $4.0 billion in the first six months of 2015 was $9.4 billion lower
than 2014 reflecting the 2015 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of exxonmobil stock in 2015.
  
during the second
quarter of 2015, exxon mobil corporation purchased 12 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1.0 billion. these purchases
were to reduce the number of shares outstanding. shares outstanding decreased
from 4,181 million at the end of first quarter to 4,169 million at the end of
the second quarter 2015. purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.


19  



 

the corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $4.1
billion in the second quarter of 2015 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2015 compared
to $6.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2014.
 
total debt of $33.8
billion compared to $29.1 billion at year-end 2014. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 15.9 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2015
compared to 13.9 percent at year-end 2014.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s
common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

billion, down 12 percent from the first six months of 2014 due primarily
to lower major project spending. the corporation anticipates an average
investment profile of about $34 billion per year for
the next few years. actual spending could vary depending on the progress of
individual projects and property acquisitions.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
expected to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements.
