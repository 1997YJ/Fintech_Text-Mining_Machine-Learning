resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies (alliance revenues).on june 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of our animal health business, zoetis inc. (zoetis), and recognized a gain of approximately $10.4 billion, net of tax, in gain on disposal of discontinued operations––net of tax in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013. the operating results of this business are reported as income from discontinued operations––net of tax in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisition, divestiture, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: divestiture and see the “our business development initiatives” and “discontinued operations” sections of this md&a.we manage our commercial operations through a global commercial structure consisting of three operating segments, each of which is led by a single manager––the global innovative pharmaceutical segment (gip); the global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare segment (voc); and the global established pharmaceutical segment (gep). each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain in-process research and development (ipr&d) projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof of concept. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 13. segment, geographic and other revenue information and the “our strategy” section of this md&a below.the financial information included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the united states (u.s.) is as of and for the three and six months ended may 25, 2014 and may 26, 2013.previously proposed combination with astrazeneca plc (astrazeneca)during april and may 2014, pfizer issued a number of announcements pursuant to rule 2.4 of the u.k. city code on takeovers and mergers (the code) regarding its consideration of a possible offer for astrazeneca plc (astrazeneca) and proposals made to the board of astrazeneca in connection therewith. pfizer announced on may 26, 2014 that it did not intend to make an offer for astrazeneca. the announcement was made in accordance with rule 2.8 of the code. as a result of this announcement, pfizer, together with any party acting in concert with pfizer, is bound by the restrictions contained in rule 2.8 of the code.our 2014 performancerevenues––second quarter 2014revenues in the second quarter of 2014 were $12.8 billion, a decrease of 2% compared to the same period in 2013, which reflects an operational decrease of $113 million, or 1%. the operational decrease was primarily the result of:•the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada (approximately $428 million);•the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-source generic competition for detrol la in the u.s., viagra in most major european markets, lyrica in canada and aricept in canada (aggregate decline of approximately $208 million);•the ongoing termination of the spiriva collaboration in certain countries (approximately $127 million); •the operational decline of certain products, including metaxalone, effexor, norvasc and caduet (approximately $129 million); and•the loss of exclusivity for certain other products (approximately $78 million),partially offset by:42•the operational growth of certain products in certain developed markets, including lyrica, nexium 24hr in the u.s. as a result of its recent launch, prevnar, eliquis, xeljanz, celebrex, xalkori and inlyta, among others (approximately $569 million); •an 11% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets, including strong operational growth from lipitor, primarily in china, and prevenar (approximately $271 million); and •revenues from the transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with zoetis (approximately $71 million).in addition, revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $87 million, or 1%, in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.revenues––first six months 2014revenues in the first six months of 2014 were $24.1 billion, a decrease of 5% compared to the same period in 2013, which reflects an operational decrease of $805 million, or 3%. the operational decrease was primarily the result of:•the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada (approximately $804 million);•the continued erosion of branded lipitor in the u.s. and most other developed markets due to generic competition and the operational decline of certain products, including, metaxalone, effexor, norvasc and caduet (approximately $361 million);•the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-source generic competition for detrol la in the u.s., viagra in most major european markets, lyrica in canada and aricept in canada (aggregate decline of approximately $421 million); •the ongoing termination of the spiriva collaboration in certain countries (approximately $303 million); and•the loss of exclusivity for certain other products (approximately $137 million),partially offset by:•the operational growth of certain products in certain developed markets, including lyrica, nexium 24hr in the u.s. as a result of its recent launch, prevnar, eliquis, xeljanz, celebrex, xalkori and inlyta, as well as the contribution from the collaboration with mylan inc. to market generic drugs in japan (approximately $871 million); •a 6% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets (approximately $334 million); and •revenues from the transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with zoetis (approximately $128 million).in addition, revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $452 million, or 2%, in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.income from continuing operations––second quarter 2014income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2014 was $2.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion in the second quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting, among other items, in addition to the lower revenues described above:•the non-recurrence in the second quarter of 2014 of patent litigation settlement income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2013 (see also the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions–net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net);•higher cost of sales (up $220 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––cost of sales" section of this md&a); and •higher research and development expenses (up $229 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––research and development (r&d) expenses" section of this md&a),partially offset by:•a lower effective tax rate (down 6.3 percentage points to 27.0%) (see also the “provision for taxes on income” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 5. tax matters);•lower asset impairments and related charges (down $126 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net" section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net);43•higher royalty-related income (up $119 million) primarily due to royalties earned on sales of enbrel in the u.s. and canada after october 31, 2013. on that date, the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired, and pfizer became entitled to royalties for a 36-month period (see also the "costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net" section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net); and•lower purchase accounting adjustments (down $115 million).income from continuing operations––first six months 2014income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2014 was $5.2 billion, compared to $6.2 billion in the first six months of 2013, primarily reflecting, among other items, in addition to the lower revenues described above:•the non-recurrence in the first six months of 2014 of the patent litigation settlement income of $1.4 billion in the first six months of 2013 (see also the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions–net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net);•higher legal charges (up $787 million), primarily due to neurontin- and effexor-related matters (see also the "costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net" section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net); and•the non-recurrence in the first six months of 2014 of the gain associated with the transfer of certain product rights to our joint venture with zhejiang hisun pharmaceuticals co., ltd. (hisun) in china in the first six months of 2013 ($459 million) (see also the "our business development initiatives " and "costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net" sections of this md&a and

condensed consolidated financial statements––note 5. tax matters);•lower asset impairment and related charges (down $506 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net" section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives and note 4. other (income)/deductions––net); •lower operational expenses due to the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives;•higher royalty-related income (up $304 million) primarily due to royalties earned on sales of enbrel in the u.s. and canada after october 31, 2013. on that date, the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired, and pfizer became entitled to royalties for a 36-month period (see also the "costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net" section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net); and•higher net gains on asset disposals (up $160 million), primarily due to gains on sales of product rights and gains on sales of investments in

(income)/deductions––net).see also the “discontinued operations” section of this md&a.our operating environmentindustry-specific challengesthe majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in our 2013 annual report on form 10-k, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and highly regulated. as a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. these factors include, among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, healthcare legislation, pipeline productivity and the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition among branded products.44intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rightsthe loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues.we have lost exclusivity for a number of our products in certain markets and we have lost collaboration rights with respect to a number of our alliance products in certain markets, and certain of our products and alliance products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years.our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim for spiriva expires on a country-by-country basis between 2012 and 2016. on april 29, 2014, the 10-year alliance between boehringer ingelheim and pfizer for the promotion and marketing of spiriva in the u.s. came to an end. boehringer ingelheim now exclusively markets and supplies spiriva in the u.s. we expect to experience a graduated decline in revenues from spiriva through 2016 as agreements for other markets enter their final year and subsequently expire. see the “intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rights" section of our 2013 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our 2013 annual report on form 10-k, for information about (i) recent losses of product exclusivity impacting product revenues, (ii) recent and expected losses of collaboration rights impacting alliance revenues and (iii) losses and expected losses of product exclusivity in 2014. in addition, we expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years. for additional information, see the “patents and other intellectual property rights” section in part i, item 1, "business", of our 2013 annual report on form 10-k.our 2014 financial guidance reflects the projected impact of the loss of exclusivity of various products and the expiration of certain alliance product contract rights discussed above. on july 29, 2014, we updated our 2014 financial guidance to reflect, among other things, the expected negative impact from anticipated multi-source generic competition for celebrex in the u.s. beginning in december 2014. for additional information about our 2014 financial guidance, including additional factors for which our guidance was updated on july 29, 2014, see the “our financial guidance for 2014” section of this md&a.we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights whenever we deem appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues––major biopharmaceutical products” and "revenues––selected product descriptions" sections of this md&a. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation.regulatory environment/pricing and access––u.s. healthcare legislationin march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (together, the u.s. healthcare legislation, and also known as the affordable care act or aca), was enacted in the u.s. as explained more fully in our 2013 annual report on form 10-k, this legislation has resulted in both current and longer-term impacts on us. we recorded the following amounts as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation:•$30 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $103 million in the second quarter of 2013, and $205 million in the first six months of 2014 and $231 million in the first six months of 2013, recorded as a reduction to revenues, related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •$54 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $75 million in the second quarter of 2013, and $25 million in the first six months of 2014 and $131 million in the first six months of 2013, recorded in selling, informational and administrative expenses, related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for u.s. income tax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs. the decrease in the first six months of 2014 was driven by a true-up associated with the final 2013 invoice received from the federal government, which reflected a lower share than that of the initial 2013 invoice.45regulatory environment/pricing and access––u.s. government and other payer group pressures•budget control act of 2011—in august 2011, the federal budget control act of 2011 (the budget control act) was enacted in the u.s. in december 2013, congress enacted minor amendments to the budget control act, providing for greater discretionary spending in 2014 and 2015 than originally budgeted. the amendments also provide for u.s. food and drug administration (fda) user fee sequester relief for two years, allowing the fda to continue to review new products. the new legislation continues to prohibit reductions in payments to medicare providers from exceeding a 2% reduction of the originally budgeted amount, and extends this prohibition for two years (until 2023). the implications to pfizer of these changes are expected to be nominal. however, any significant spending reductions affecting medicare, medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit-reduction effort or legislative replacement for the budget control act, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.•sustainable growth rate replacement—the medicare physician payment formula known as the sustainable growth rate (sgr) is routinely overridden by congressional action because it would lead to dramatic decreases in physician payment. on april 1, 2014, the president signed into law another extension that will maintain physician payment through march 2015. prior to expiration of the extension, it is likely that congress will consider legislation to permanently repeal the sgr and replace it with a new payment model. the congressional budget office has estimated that the cost to the federal government of repealing and replacing the sgr would be approximately $130 billion over 10 years. the source of those funds could include additional taxes on and/or rebate requirements applicable to the pharmaceutical industry, including pfizer. •federal debt ceiling—after the u.s. federal debt ceiling was reached on may 19, 2013 and measures taken by the u.s. treasury department to enable the u.s. federal government to continue meeting its financial obligations were nearly exhausted, congress enacted legislation on october 16, 2013 that suspended the debt ceiling through february 7, 2014 and preserved the ability of the u.s. treasury department to use “extraordinary measures” to avoid a default on u.s. federal government debt for a short period of time thereafter. in february 2014, congress enacted legislation that further suspends the debt ceiling until march 15, 2015, effectively ensuring the u.s. federal government’s ability to satisfy its financial obligations until that date, including under medicare, medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that have a direct impact on our results of operations. as the healthcare spending growth rate in the u.s. continues to outpace inflation, cost-reduction and access pressures are increasing in intensity. containing entitlement spending, including medicare and medicaid, is a major focus of deficit-reduction efforts. the aca, which expanded the role of the u.s. government as a healthcare payer, is accelerating changes in the u.s. healthcare marketplace, and the potential for additional pricing and access pressures continues to be significant. some employers, seeking to avoid the tax on high-cost health insurance in the aca to be imposed in 2018, are already scaling back healthcare benefits. overall, there is increasing pressure on u.s. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions. these new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. at the same time, these models can also expand utilization by encouraging physicians to screen, diagnose and focus on outcomes. in response to the evolving u.s. and global healthcare spending landscape, we are continuing to work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major u.s. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products. further, we are seeking to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs. the global economic environmentin addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, and as explained more fully in our 2013 annual report on form 10-k, we, like other businesses, continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment, which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the u.s., europe and japan, and in a number of emerging markets. •we believe that patients, who are experiencing increases in co-pays and restrictions on access to medicines as payers seek to control costs, sometimes switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. we continue to experience pricing pressure in various markets around the world, including in the u.s. with highly competitive insurance markets, in developed european markets, japan and in a number of emerging markets, with government-mandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products and government-imposed access restrictions in certain countries. 46furthermore, some government agencies and third-party payers use health technology assessments in ways that, at times, lead to restricted access to and lower prices for new medicines.•we continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. for further information about our accounts receivable, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.•significant portions of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen, australian dollar, the u.k. pound, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. conversely, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including venezuela, can impact our results and financial guidance. for further information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a. despite the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial condition, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2013 annual report on form 10-k.our strategywe believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. we continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. we continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to patients and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. we remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company's purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that significantly improve their lives. by doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders. commercial operationsat the beginning of our fiscal year 2014, we began managing our commercial operations through a new global commercial structure consisting of three operating segments, each of which is led by a single manager––the global innovative pharmaceutical segment (gip); the global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare segment (voc); and the global established pharmaceutical segment (gep). a significant change effected by our new structure is the full integration of emerging markets into each business. emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our new structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets.some additional information about each product grouping follows:47•global innovative pharmaceutical segment––gip comprises medicines within several therapeutic areas that are generally expected to have market exclusivity beyond 2015. these therapeutic areas include immunology and inflammation, cardiovascular/metabolic, neuroscience and pain, rare diseases and women's/men's health. •global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare segment––voc focuses on the development and commercialization of vaccines and products for oncology and consumer healthcare. each of the three businesses that comprise this segment operates with distinct specialization in terms of the science, talent and market approach necessary to deliver value to consumers and patients. •global established pharmaceutical segment––gep includes the brands that have lost market exclusivity and, generally, the mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 in most major markets and, to a much smaller extent, generic pharmaceuticals. additionally, gep includes our sterile injectable products and biosimilar development portfolio.we expect that the gip and voc biopharmaceutical portfolios of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line products will be sustained by ongoing internal investments and targeted business development designed to maximize the value of our in-line products and ensure a robust pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need. the assets managed by these groups are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers. in addition, voc includes our consumer healthcare business, which manufactures and markets several well-known, over-the-counter (otc) products. gep is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. gep leverages our biologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. gep may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its commercial strategies.for additional information about our operating structure, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 13a. segment, geographic and other revenue information: segment information.for additional information about the 2014 performance of each of our operating segments, see the "analysis of operating segment information" section of this md&a.research operationswe continue to transform our global r&d organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules––immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. another area of focus is biosimilars. while a significant portion of r&d is done internally, we continue to seek to expand our pipeline by entering into agreements with other companies to develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. collaboration, alliance and license agreements and acquisitions allow us to capitalize on these compounds to expand our pipeline of potential future products. in addition, collaborations and alliances allow us to share risk and to access external scientific and technological expertise.for additional information about r&d by operating segment, see the "analysis of operating segment information" section of this md&a. for

our pipeline, enhance our product portfolio and maximize the value of our in-line products, see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.48intellectual property rightswe continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. in addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches designed to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity. for additional information about our current efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation.capital allocation and expense managementwe seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and robust liquidity so that we continue to have the financial resources necessary to take advantage of prudent commercial, research and business development opportunities and to directly enhance shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. for additional information about our financial condition, liquidity, capital resources, share purchases and dividends, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.we remain focused on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the company. for additional information about our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, see the “costs and expenses––restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a.our business development initiativeswe are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. we are especially interested in opportunities in our high-priority therapeutic areas––immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases––and in emerging markets and established products. another area of focus is biosimilars. we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities for our businesses.the more significant recent transactions and events are described below. •marketed vaccines business of baxter international inc. (baxter)––on july 30, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines for $635 million. as part of the transaction, we will also acquire a portion of baxter’s facility in orth, austria, where these vaccines are manufactured. baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines consists of neisvac-c and fsme-immun/ticovac. neisvac-c is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group c meningococcal meningitis and fsme-immun/ticovac is a vaccine that helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions as well as regulatory approvals in several markets, including some countries in the european union (eu), and is expected to occur by the end of 2014. as announced on july 30, 2014, we do not expect this transaction to have an impact on our 2014 financial guidance.•innopharma, inc. (innopharma)––on july 16, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire innopharma, a privately held pharmaceutical development company, for an upfront cash payment of $225 million and up to $135 million of contingent milestone payments. innopharma’s current portfolio includes ten generic products approved by the fda. innopharma also has a pipeline of 19 products filed with the fda and more than 30 injectable and ophthalmic products under development. innopharma seeks to develop novel formulations of existing drugs, including hard-to-make products, such as those that require complex manufacturing capabilities, in areas such as cancer and central nervous disorders. the closing of the transaction is subject to u.s. regulatory approval and is expected to occur during the third quarter of 2014.•collaboration with cellectis sa (cellectis)––on june 18, 2014, we entered into a global strategic collaboration with cellectis to develop chimeric antigen receptor t-cell (car-t) immunotherapies in the field of oncology directed at select cellular surface antigen targets. cellectis received an upfront payment of $80 million in august 2014, and will receive funding for research and development costs associated with pfizer-selected targets and the four cellectis-selected targets within the collaboration. cellectis is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per pfizer product within the collaboration. cellectis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of any products that are commercialized by pfizer. additionally, we entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 10% of the cellectis capital through the purchase of newly issued shares at 9.25 euro per share, for a total investment of 49approximately $35 million. cellectis’ shareholders approved the issuance of the new shares to pfizer on july 31, 2014 and we purchased the shares in august, 2014. •viiv healthcare limited (viiv)––on january 21, 2014, the european commission approved tivicay (dolutegravir), a product for the treatment of hiv-1 infection, developed by viiv, an equity method investee. this approval, in accordance with the agreement between glaxosmithkline plc and pfizer, triggered a reduction in our equity interest in viiv from 12.6% to 11.7% and an increase in glaxosmithkline plc’s equity interest in viiv from 77.4% to 78.3%, effective april 1, 2014. as a result, in the first six months of 2014, we recognized a loss of approximately $28 million in other (income)/deductions––net. we continue to account for our investment in viiv under the equity method due to the significant influence that we continue to have through our board representation and minority veto rights.•zoetis––on june 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of zoetis. the full disposition was completed through a series of steps, including, in the first quarter of 2013, the formation of zoetis and an initial public offering (ipo) of an approximate 19.8% interest in zoetis and, in the second quarter of 2013, an exchange offer for the remaining 80.2% interest. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisition, divestiture, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: divestiture.•hisun pfizer pharmaceuticals company limited (hisun pfizer)––on september 6, 2012, we and zhejiang hisun pharmaceuticals co., ltd. (hisun), a leading pharmaceutical company in china, formed a new company, hisun pfizer, 49% owned by pfizer and 51% owned by hisun, to develop, manufacture, market and sell pharmaceutical products, primarily branded generic products, predominately in china. in the first quarter of 2013, we and hisun contributed certain assets to hisun pfizer. our contributions constituted a business, as defined by u.s. gaap, and in the first six months of 2013, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $459 million in other (income)/deductions––net. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2d. acquisition, divestiture, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: equity-method investments.•nexium over-the-counter rights––in august 2012, we entered into an agreement with astrazeneca for the exclusive, global, over-the-counter (otc) rights for nexium, a leading prescription drug currently approved to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. at that time, we made an upfront payment of $250 million to astrazeneca, which was expensed. on march 28, 2014, the fda approved nexium 24hr (esomeprazole 20 mg) for otc use. pfizer launched the product in the u.s. on may 27, 2014 and subsequently on july 11, 2014, we paid astrazeneca a $200 million product launch milestone in accordance with the terms of the agreement. the milestone for this consumer healthcare asset acquisition has been recorded in identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization in the consolidated condensed balance sheet and will be amortized over its estimated useful life. astrazeneca is eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $350 million, based on product launches outside the u.s. and level of worldwide sales, as well as royalty payments, based on worldwide sales.for a description of the more significant recent transactions through february 28, 2014, the filing date of our 2013 annual

components of the financial guidance.(b) as reported on july 29, 2014, certain financial guidance components have been updated to reflect performance in the first six months of the year as well as the following factors:•adjusted revenues: the expected negative impact from anticipated multi-source generic competition for celebrex in the u.s. beginning in december 2014. in addition to the approximate one month of multi-source generic competition, celebrex revenues also are expected to be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2014 by associated wholesaler and retailer destocking

aforementioned anticipated multi-source generic competition in the u.s. beginning in december 2014.•adjusted research and development expenses: the impact from the $80 million upfront payment to cellectis associated with the global strategic collaboration announced on june 18, 2014, as well as higher expected expenses related to the planned acceleration of certain late-stage clinical programs, including palbociclib and bococizumab, among other programs.•adjusted other (income)/deductions: the favorable impacts of lower expected net interest expense over the remainder of 2014 (as compared to that assumed in connection with our original financial guidance) as well as gains realized in the first six months of 2014 on sales of product rights and of investments in equity securities, among various other factors.•reported diluted eps: the negative impact from charges related to certain legal matters, primarily related to neurontin, incurred in the first quarter of

2014, a decrease of $383 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. in addition to the operational factors noted in the "our 2014 performance" section of this md&a, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by $419 million, or 2%, in the first six months of 2014. foreign exchange did not have a significant impact on biopharmaceutical revenues in the second quarter of 2014.geographically, •in the u.s., biopharmaceutical revenues decreased $332 million, or 7%, in the second quarter of 2014 and decreased $962 million, or 10%, in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, reflecting, among other things:◦lower alliance revenues, primarily due to enbrel, reflecting the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement in october 2013 (approximately $402 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $753 million in the first six months of 2014), and spiriva, reflecting the final-year terms, and termination on april 29, 2014, of the co-promotion collaboration, which, per the terms of the collaboration agreement, resulted in a decline of our share of spiriva revenue (approximately $101 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $250 million in the first six months of 2014); and◦lower revenues from detrol la due to loss of exclusivity (approximately $88 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $190 million in the first six months of 2014), and lower revenues from lipitor (approximately $112 million in the first six months of 2014),53partially offset by:◦the strong performance of lyrica (approximately $110 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $186 million in the first six months of 2014) as well as the growth of xeljanz, prevnar, eliquis, xalkori and celebrex (approximately $184 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $260 million in the first six months of 2014).•in our international markets, biopharmaceutical revenues decreased $51 million, or 1%, in the second quarter of 2014 and decreased $488 million, or 3%, in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. operationally, revenues increased $25 million in the second quarter of 2014 and decreased $69 million, or relatively flat as a percentage of revenues for both the second quarter and six month periods in 2014 compared to the same periods in 2013 reflecting, among other things:◦lower revenues as a result of the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-source generic competition for viagra in most major european markets and lyrica in canada (approximately $92 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $200 million in the first six months of 2014);◦the operational decline of certain products, including norvasc, xalabrands, zithromax and effexor, in developed international markets, and sutent in china (approximately $75 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $139 million for the first six months of 2014);◦lower alliance revenues (approximately $38 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $104 million in the first six months of 2014), primarily due to the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel, the ongoing termination of the spiriva collaboration agreement in certain countries, the loss of exclusivity for aricept in canada (primarily impacting the second quarter of 2014) and the termination of the co-promotion agreement for aricept in japan in december 2012 (primarily impacting the first six months of 2014); and◦the continued erosion of branded lipitor in most international developed markets (approximately $45 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $75 million for the first six months of 2014),partially offset by:◦the operational growth of xeljanz, prevnar and celebrex as well as the contribution from the collaboration with mylan inc. to market generic drugs in japan (approximately $108 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $155 million in the first six months of 2014); and◦higher revenues for enbrel outside canada, lyrica in developed markets, and the performance of recently launched products xalkori and inlyta (collectively, up approximately $125 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $273 million in the first six months of 2014).the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on international biopharmaceutical revenues of 1%, or approximately $77 million, in the second quarter of 2014 and 3%, or approximately $419 million, in the first six months of 2014 also contributed to a decrease in biopharmaceutical revenues from our international markets.during the second quarter of 2014, international biopharmaceutical revenues represented 62.4% of total biopharmaceutical revenues, compared to 60.9% in the second quarter of 2013. during the first six months of 2014, international biopharmaceutical revenues represented 62.7% of total biopharmaceutical revenues, compared with 60.9% in the first six months of 2013.for additional information about operating segment revenues, see the "analysis of operating segment information" section of this md&a.rebates and chargebacksas is typical in the biopharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions, that generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized and primarily represent rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results generally have been less than 1% of biopharmaceutical net sales and can result in either a net increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.54the following table provides

therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures. in certain countries outside the u.s., indications include neuropathic pain (peripheral and central), fibromyalgia, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder. worldwide revenues for lyrica increased 16% in the second quarter of 2014, and 12% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. in the u.s., revenues increased 22% in the second quarter of 2014, and 20% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, driven by increased investment in effective direct-to-consumer advertising combined with strong field force performance and the recent promotional launch of new data demonstrating efficacy in treating fibromyalgia patients receiving antidepressants for their co-morbid depression, despite continued competition from generic versions of competitive medicines. internationally, lyrica revenues increased 11% in the second quarter of 2014, and 6% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, with the growth due to a focus on enhancing diagnosis and treatment rates of neuropathic back pain, and expediting the identification and appropriate treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in the eu, physician education regarding neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in japan and an effective direct-to-consumer campaign to increase awareness in japan. in addition, growth was driven by gaining reimbursement in australia and an effective multi-channel direct-to-consumer campaign driving an increase in visits to physicians. foreign exchange had a favorable impact on international revenues of 1% in the second quarter 2014, and an unfavorable impact of 1% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. worldwide revenues from lyrica in our gip segment increased operationally 16% in the second quarter of 2014 and 14% in the first six months of 2014, and in our gep segment, revenues from lyrica increased operationally 13% in the second quarter of 2014 and 10% in the first six months of 2014.•prevnar family of products (v) consists of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 and prevnar/prevenar (7-valent), our pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for the prevention of various syndromes of pneumococcal disease. overall, worldwide revenues for the prevnar family of products increased 13% in the second quarter of 2014, and 7% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. in the u.s., revenues for the prevnar family of products increased 12% in the second quarter of 2014, and 8% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, mainly due to price increases and government purchasing patterns, and increased demand, primarily driven by the additional market penetration for prevnar 13 for adults. internationally, revenues for the prevnar family of products increased 14% in the second quarter of 2014, and 5% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily reflecting increased shipments associated with the global alliance for vaccines and immunization as well as the timing of government purchases in various emerging markets. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 1% in the second quarter 2014, and an unfavorable impact of 3% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. on february 24, 2014, we announced the top-line results of the community-acquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults (capita), which was conducted in order to fulfill requirements in connection with the fda’s approval of the prevnar 13 adult indication under its accelerated approval program. this study of approximately 85,000 subjects evaluated the efficacy of prevnar 13 in adults age 65 and older. capita met its primary clinical objective, which was efficacy against a first episode of vaccine-type, community-acquired pneumonia (cap). it also met both of its secondary clinical objectives, which were efficacy against (i) a first episode of non-bacteremic/non-invasive, vaccine-type cap and (ii) a first episode of vaccine-type, invasive pneumococcal disease. we are in the process of sharing the capita data with u.s. and worldwide regulatory authorities and vaccine technical committees to help inform any decisions regarding potential prevnar 13 label and recommendation updates. we made submissions of this data to the fda and eu regulatory authorities in july 2014. we expect to complete submissions to other worldwide regulatory authorities during the third quarter of 2014. we expect that the capita data will be an important component in any consideration of potential updated or new recommendations for adults and that other key factors, such as the current burden of pneumococcal disease in adults, also will be taken into consideration. we discussed with the centers for disease control and prevention’s (cdc) advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) at their scheduled june 2014 meeting the results of the capita data as well as other considerations regarding a potential expanded recommendation for prevnar 13 use among adults. we look forward to continued dialogue with the acip as well as its decision on a potential expanded recommendation at a meeting scheduled for august 13, 2014.58on june 20, 2014, prevenar 13 was approved in japan for adults 65 years of age and older for the prevention of pneumococcal disease caused by 13 s. pneumoniae serotypes covered by the vaccine.•enbrel (gip, outside of the u.s. and canada), for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis affecting the spine, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues, excluding the u.s. and canada, of 2% in the second quarter of 2014, and 3% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. results were favorably impacted by continued market leadership in rheumatoid arthritis. foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 1% in the second quarter of 2014 and an unfavorable impact of 1% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement with amgen inc. (amgen), under which we co-promoted enbrel in the u.s. and canada and shared in the profits from enbrel sales in those countries, and which we included in alliance revenues through october 31, 2013, expired on that date and, subject to the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to a royalty stream for 36 months thereafter, which has been and is expected to continue to be significantly less than our share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canadian sales prior to the expiration. the royalties paid to us during the 36-month period are and will be included in other (income)/deductions––net rather than in revenues in our consolidated statements of income from november 1, 2013. following the end of the royalty period, we are not entitled to any further revenues from enbrel sales in the u.s. and canada. our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the u.s. and canada will not be affected by the expiration of the co-promotion agreement with amgen. •celebrex (gep), indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis worldwide and for the management of acute pain in adults in the u.s., japan and certain other markets, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 7% in the second quarter of 2014, and 1% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to favorable pricing in the u.s. and strong demand from the lower back pain indication in japan, partially offset by share erosion in the u.s. and the developed markets in europe.in the u.s., revenues increased 9% in the second quarter of 2014, and 2% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to price increases and overall market growth, partially offset by continued share erosion, retailer inventory reductions, and higher rebates than those a year ago. internationally, celebrex revenues increased 2% in the second quarter of 2014, and decreased 1% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. strong operational performance in international markets in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, was driven by growth in japan (strong performance in the low back pain and osteoarthritis indications), south korea (maintaining share despite competition), and in emerging markets, partially offset by lower revenues in the developed markets in europe due to price reductions as governments continue to address their budget deficits. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 3% in the second quarter of 2014, and 5% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. •lipitor (gep) is for the treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood. lipitor has lost exclusivity and faces generic competition in all major markets. branded lipitor recorded worldwide revenues of $543 million, relatively unchanged in the second quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to continued brand erosion in the u.s. and developed markets due to generic competition, offset by operational increases in emerging markets, primarily in china. revenues were $1.0 billion, or a decrease of 15%, in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, due to:◦the impact of loss of exclusivity; ◦the continuing impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition from generics and branded products worldwide; and ◦the increased payer pressure worldwide, including the need for flexible rebate policies,partially offset by:◦lower rebates in the u.s. geographically,◦in the u.s., revenues increased 12% in the second quarter of 2014, and decreased 43% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013; and ◦in our international markets, revenues decreased 3% in the second quarter of 2014, and 7% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 2% in the second quarter of 2014, and 2% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013.59viagra (gep/gip) is indicated for the treatment for erectile dysfunction. viagra worldwide revenues decreased 12% in the second quarter of 2014, and 15% in the first six months, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in international revenues. international (gep) revenues decreased 31% in the second quarter, and 35% in the first six months, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to the entry of generics in developed europe. loss of exclusivity for viagra in major european markets occurred in late-june 2013. revenues in the u.s. (gip) increased 3% in the second quarter of 2014, and 1% in the first six months, compared to the same periods in 2013.•zyvox (gep) is the world’s best-selling branded agent among those used to treat

compared to the same periods in 2013. the decrease in the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to a prolonged supply interruption of zyvox iv in china that is expected to continue through 2014. foreign exchange had a favorable impact on international revenues of 1% in the second quarter of 2014, and an unfavorable impact of 2% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013.•sutent (o) is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc); gastrointestinal stromal tumors after disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate; and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. sutent worldwide revenues decreased 1% in the second quarter of 2014, and 6% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, as a result of competitive pressure, timing of sales in emerging markets, a change in purchasing patterns in the u.s., and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 1% in the second quarter of 2014 and 1% in the first six months of 2014, partially offset by price increases in the u.s. and increased market share in japan and south korea.•norvasc (gep) is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. norvasc worldwide revenues decreased 10% in the second quarter of 2014, and 9% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, and reflects,

2013.•our premarin family of products (gep) helps women address moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms. premarin worldwide revenues were flat in the second quarter of 2014, and increased 1% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. revenues in the u.s. were favorably impacted by the launch of a new women's health-focused sales force, increased marketing support, and a cross-franchise price increase, and unfavorably impacted by prescription volume declines for premarin family oral brands.•benefix and refacto af/xyntha (gip) are hemophilia products using state-of-the-art manufacturing that assist patients with their lifelong bleeding disorders. benefix recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 5% in both the second quarter and first six months of

in the u.s. increased 18% in the second quarter of 2014, and 8% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to price increases, partially offset by competition from otc competitors, mainly nicorette and a movement by smokers to e-cigarettes. international revenues decreased 13% in the second quarter of 2014, and 18% in the first six months, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to overall market decline across several key markets as a result of a challenging macro-economic environment, strong competitive pressure from aggressive nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) consumer promotion and the widespread availability of e-cigarettes and use of prescription medication, as well as the lingering impact from previous negative media exposure and the unfavorable impact on international revenues of foreign exchange of 3% in the second quarter of 2014 and 4% in the first six months of 2014.60•xalkori (o), for the treatment of patients with

as well as positive consumer awareness. xeljanz also has been approved in colombia, uruguay, chile, taiwan, bolivia, guatemala, philippines, and ecuador. •alliance revenues (gep/gip) worldwide decreased 69% in the second quarter of 2014, and 70% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, mainly due to:◦the expiration or near-term expiration of the co-promotion collaboration for spiriva (gep) in japan, the u.s. (where the collaboration expired in april 2014), and certain european countries combined with the expiration of the collaboration in australia, canada and south korea, which resulted in a decrease in pfizer's share of spiriva revenues of $127 million in the second quarter of 2014, and $303 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013;◦the loss of exclusivity for aricept in canada in december 2013, which resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately $28 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, and combined with the termination of the co-promotion agreement for aricept (gep) in japan in december 2012, resulted in a decrease in pfizer's share of aricept revenues of approximately $59 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013; and◦the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada in october 2013, which resulted in a decrease of $428 million in the second quarter of 2014, and $804 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. (while enbrel alliance revenues declined $428 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $804 million in the first six months of 2014, we received royalty income from enbrel in the u.s. and canada of $124 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $261 million in the first six months of 2014, which is recorded in other (income)/deductions—net in the condensed consolidated statements on income. see

of our 2013 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our 2013 annual report on form 10-k and this quarterly report on form 10-q, for information regarding the expiration of various contract rights relating to aricept, spiriva, enbrel and rebif.on april 29, 2014, the 10-year alliance between boehringer ingelheim and pfizer for the promotion and marketing of spiriva in the u.s. came to an end. boehringer ingelheim now exclusively markets and supplies spiriva in the u.s.•eliquis (apixaban) (gip) is being jointly developed and commercialized by pfizer and bristol-myers squibb (bms). in 2012, eliquis (apixaban) was approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the 27 countries of the eu, plus iceland and norway, canada, japan and the u.s. to date, we have launched that indication for eliquis in the u.s., 23 eu markets, canada and australia. the two companies share 61commercialization expenses and profit/losses equally on a global basis. while we are the third entrant in this market, we believe we have a differentiated product profile and continue to invest in medical education, peer-to-peer programs to assist physicians in understanding the data, and direct-to-consumer advertising in the u.s. we have seen increased prescribing by cardiologists and primary care providers compared to prior periods.•embeda (gip)—in november 2013, we announced that the fda had approved a prior approval supplement for an update to the embeda manufacturing process. this update addressed the pre-specified stability requirement that led to the voluntary recall of embeda from the market in march 2011. we anticipate returning embeda to the market in early 2015.see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies for a discussion of recent developments concerning patent and product litigation relating to certain of the products discussed above.product developmentswe continue to invest in r&d to provide potential future sources of revenues through the development of new products, as well as through additional uses for in-line and alliance products. notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for existing products or any of our other products in development.we continue to transform our global r&d organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will

capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules—immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. another area of focus is biosimilars. our development pipeline, which is updated quarterly, can be found at www.pfizer.com/pipeline. it includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication, phase of development and, for late-stage programs, mechanism of action. the information currently in our development pipeline is as of august 7, 2014.among our new drug candidates in late-stage development is palbociclib (pd-0332991), an oral and selective reversible inhibitor of the cdk 4 and 6 kinases under investigation for the treatment of patients with estrogen receptor-positive (er+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- negative (her2-) advanced breast cancer, recurrent advanced breast cancer and high-risk early breast cancer. on february 3, 2014, we announced that paloma-1, the randomized phase 2 trial of palbociclib achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival for the combination of palbociclib and letrozole compared with letrozole alone in post-menopausal women with er+, her2- locally advanced or newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer. adverse events observed for the palbociclib arm were consistent with the known adverse event profile for this combination. in june 2014, we initiated a rolling submission of a new drug application (nda) to the fda seeking approval for palbociclib, combined with letrozole, as a first-line systemic treatment for post-menopausal women with er+, her2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. the submission is based on the final results of paloma-1. we expect to complete the submission in august 2014.the following series of tables provides information about significant regulatory actions by, and filings pending with, the fda and regulatory authorities in the eu and japan, as well as additional indications and new drug

was developed in collaboration with bms.(b) in may 2012, the fda's peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. in june 2012, the fda issued a “complete response” letter with respect to the tafamidis nda. the fda has requested the completion of a second efficacy study, and also has asked for additional information on the data within the current tafamidis nda. we continue to work with the fda to define a path forward.(c) after receiving a “complete response” letter from the fda for the genotropin mark vii multidose disposable device submission, we submitted our response in august 2010. in april 2011, we received a second “complete response” letter from the fda, and we submitted our response in july 2013. in february 2014, we received a third "complete response" letter from the fda, and we are working with the fda to determine next steps.(d) in june 2010, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the celebrex chronic pain supplemental nda. the supplemental nda remains pending while we await the completion of the precision trial, anticipated in 2015, which will inform our next steps. the precision trial is designed to assess the relative long-term cardiovascular safety of celebrex compared to prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen in the treatment of arthritis pain.(e) in 2005, king pharmaceuticals, inc. (king) entered into an agreement with pain therapeutics, inc. (pt) to develop and commercialize remoxy. in august 2008, the fda accepted the nda for remoxy that had been submitted by king and pt. in december 2008, the fda issued a “complete response” letter. in march 2009, king exercised its right under the agreement with pt to assume sole control and responsibility for the development of remoxy. in december 2010, king resubmitted the nda for remoxy with the fda. in june 2011, we and pt announced that a “complete response” letter had been received from the fda with regard to the resubmission of the nda. having achieved technical milestones related to manufacturing and following guidance received from the fda earlier in 2013, we announced in october 2013 that we will proceed with the additional clinical studies and other actions required to address the "complete response" letter received in june 2011. these new clinical studies will include, in part, a pivotal bioequivalence study with the modified remoxy formulation to bridge to the clinical data related to the original remoxy formulation, and an abuse-potential study with the modified formulation. as previously disclosed, the "complete response" submission is not expected to occur prior to mid-2015.(f) two “approvable” letters were received by wyeth in april and december 2007 from the fda for viviant (bazedoxifene), for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, that set forth the additional requirements for approval. in may 2008, wyeth received an “approvable” letter from the fda for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. the fda is seeking additional data, and we have been systematically working through these requirements and seeking to address the fda's concerns. in february 2008, the fda advised wyeth that it expects to convene an advisory committee to review the pending ndas for both the treatment and prevention indications after we submit our response to the “approvable” letters. in view of the recent approval of duavee by the fda, we are reassessing the next steps regarding our ndas for viviant. in april 2009, wyeth received approval in the eu for conbriza (the eu trade name for viviant) for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture. 63regulatory approvals and filings in the eu and japanproductdescription of eventdate approveddate filed*eliquis (apixaban)(a)approval in the eu

we announced that the randomized phase 2 trial of palbociclib achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival for the combination of palbociclib and letrozole compared with letrozole alone in post-menopausal women with er+, her2- locally advanced or newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer. adverse events observed for the palbociclib arm were consistent with the known adverse event profile for this combination.(c) the tanezumab program is under a partial clinical hold by the fda pending our submission of additional nonclinical data. we anticipate submitting that data to the fda during the first quarter of 2015. subject to the removal of the partial clinical hold, we are planning to continue development of tanezumab for the treatment of osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain. in october 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with eli lilly and company to jointly develop and globally commercialize tanezumab for those indications.additional product-related programs are in various stages of discovery and development. also, see the discussion in the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.costs and expensescost of sales  three months ended six months ended(millions of dollars) june 29, 2014 june 30, 2013 % change june 29,

as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. these increases are primarily due to unfavorable changes in product mix, resulting from, among other things, the loss of enbrel alliance revenue after october 31, 2013, when the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired, the loss of spiriva alliance revenue in the u.s. as of april 29, 2014, and increased sales of prevnar at a lower margin to the global alliance for vaccines and immunization. cost of sales in the first six months of 2014 were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2013 as the unfavorable impact due to the changes in product mix discussed above was substantially offset by favorable foreign exchange.selling, informational and administrative (si&a) expenses  three months ended six months ended(millions of dollars) june 29, 2014 june 30, 2013 % change june 29, 2014 june 30,

quarter of 2014 and decreased 4% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to:•lower expenses for field force and administration, reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, partly in response to product losses of exclusivity;•for the first six months of 2014, a reduction related to a true-up of the 2013 fee payable to the federal government under the u.s. healthcare legislation based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs; and•the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 1% for both periods,partially offset by:•increased investments in support of several recent product launches.65research and development (r&d) expenses  three

primarily due to costs associated with recently initiated phase 3 programs for certain new drug candidates as well as for studies of certain products in potential new indications and investment in our portfolio primarily to support acceleration of the meningitis b vaccine and palbociclib development programs.see also the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a.our r&d spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations––research units, within our worldwide research and development organization, are generally responsible for research assets (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept); business units are generally responsible for development assets (assets that have achieved proof-of-concept); and science-based and other platform-services organizations.we take a holistic approach to our r&d operations and manage the operations on a total-company basis through our matrix organizations described above. specifically, a single committee, co-chaired by members of our r&d and commercial organizations, is accountable for aligning resources among all of our r&d projects and for seeking to ensure that our company is focusing its r&d resources in the areas where we believe that we can be most successful and maximize our return on investment. we believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.our research units are organized in a variety of ways (by therapeutic area or combinations of therapeutic areas, by discipline, by location, etc.) to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. because of our structure, we can rapidly redeploy resources, within a research unit, between various projects as necessary because the workforce shares similar skills, expertise and/or focus.our platform-services organizations, where a significant portion of our r&d spending occurs, provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects, and are organized into science-based functions such as pharmaceutical sciences, chemistry, drug safety, and development operations, and non-science-based functions, such as facilities, business technology and finance. as a result, within each of these functions, we are able to migrate resources among projects, candidates and/or targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases of development, allowing us to react quickly in response to evolving needs.generally, we do not disaggregate total r&d expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage a significant portion of our r&d operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, as conditions change, we believe that any prior-period information about r&d expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.restructuring charges and other costs associated with

associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives included in cost of sales, research and development expenses and/or selling, informational and administrative expenses, as appropriate.we can incur significant costs in connection with acquiring, integrating and restructuring businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. for example:66•in connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and•in connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization and optimization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives decreased 13% in the second quarter of 2014, and decreased 30% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, due to lower costs incurred in most categories: restructuring charges (down $84 million in the second quarter and $139 million in the first six months of 2014), integration costs (down $18 million in the second quarter and $36 million in the first six months of 2014), additional depreciation––asset restructuring (up $33 million in the second quarter and down $28 million in the first six months of 2014) and higher implementation costs (up $30 million in the second quarter and up $23 million in the first six months of 2014). the overall lower costs primarily reflect the fact that we had substantially completed many of the initiatives launched in prior periods.in early 2014, we announced that we would be incurring costs in 2014-2016 related to new programs: our new global commercial structure reorganization and additional cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. see below for a description of our current programs, expected total costs and expected cost savings. for additional information about the charges, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.all of our businesses and functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and r&d, as well as groups such as information technology, shared services and corporate operations.programs, expected total costs and expected cost savingsin 2014, we have the following initiatives underway:•manufacturing plant network rationalization and optimization, where execution timelines are necessarily long. our plant network strategy is expected to result in the exit of ten sites over the next several years. in connection with these activities, during 2014-2016, we expect to incur costs of approximately $450 million associated with prior acquisition activity and costs of approximately $1.5 billion associated with new non-acquisition-related cost-reduction initiatives.•new global commercial structure reorganization, which primarily includes the streamlining of certain functions, the realignment of regional locations and colleagues to support the businesses, as well as implementing the necessary system changes to support future reporting requirements. in connection with this reorganization, during 2014-2016, we expect to incur costs of approximately $350 million.•other new cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, primarily related to commercial property rationalization and consolidation. in connection with these cost-reduction activities, during 2014-2016, we expect to incur costs of approximately $900 million.the costs expected to be incurred during 2014-2016, of approximately $3.2 billion in total, include restructuring charges, integration costs, implementation costs and additional depreciation––asset restructuring. of this amount, we expect that about a quarter of the charges will be non-cash.the expected ongoing annual cost savings associated with the programs described above, in the aggregate, are estimated to be approximately $2.9 billion by the end of 2016.the expected costs and costs savings in 2014 associated with these activities are reflected in our financial guidance for 2014. see also the “our financial guidance for 2014” section of this md&a.in addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.67current-period key activitiesin the first six months of 2014, we incurred approximately $423 million in cost-reduction and acquisition-related costs (excluding transaction costs) in connection with the aforementioned programs, primarily associated with our manufacturing and sales operations.

medicines, consumer healthcare (otc) products, and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income. the adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted income measure is utilized:•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income basis;•our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis; and•senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted income measure. adjusted income is the performance metric utilized in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are funded from a pool based on the performance measured by three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from adjusted income. this metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool. the pool applies to the bonus plans for virtually all bonus-eligible, non-sales-force employees worldwide, including the elt members and other members of senior management.despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.70we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a group of pharmaceutical industry peers, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans. adjusted income components“adjusted income” components are defined as the corresponding reported u.s. gaap components, excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. adjusted revenues, adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses, adjusted research and development expenses, adjusted amortization of intangible assets and adjusted other (income)/deductions––net are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall adjusted income measure. as described above, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. see the accompanying reconciliations of certain gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted information for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013 below. the adjusted income component measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for the u.s. gaap component measures.purchase accounting adjustmentsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with pharmacia (acquired in 2003), wyeth (acquired in 2009) and king (acquired in 2011), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research and development costs previously have been expensed.however, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.acquisition-related costsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.71we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory authorities.discontinued operationsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations such as the gains on the full disposition of our former animal health business (zoetis) in june 2013, the sale of our former nutrition business in november 2012 and the sale of our former capsugel business in august 2011. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.certain significant itemsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our new global commercial structure reorganization and our other non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transitional service, manufacturing and supply agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12a. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings, included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.72reconciliation of gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted information––certain line items  three months ended june 29, 2014in millions, except per common

(a combined increase of approximately $234 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $469 million for the first six months of 2014).the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 1% in the first six months of 2014 also contributed to the decrease in gip revenues. foreign exchange had no impact on gip revenues in the second quarter of 2014.total gip revenues from emerging markets were $417 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $774 million in the first six months of 2014.•cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2013, due to the loss of enbrel alliance revenue after october 31, 2013 when the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired. •selling, informational and administrative expenses increased 13% in the second quarter of 2014 and 11% in the first six months, compared to the same periods in 2013, reflecting increased investment in recently launched brands as well as certain other in-line products, partially offset by the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. •research and development expenses increased 41% in the second quarter of 2014 and 34% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, reflecting costs associated with recently initiated phase 3 programs for certain new drug candidates as well as for studies of certain products in potential new indications.•the favorable change in other (income)/deductions––net in the second quarter of 2014 and in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily reflects an increase in royalty-related income, primarily due to royalties earned on sales of enbrel in the u.s. and canada after october 31, 2013. as noted above, on that date, the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired, and pfizer became entitled to royalties for a 36-month period.81global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare operating segment•revenues increased 14% in the second quarter of 2014, and increased 7% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, which includes an increase in operational revenues of 15% in the second quarter of 2014 and 9% in the first six months of 2014.◦global vaccines revenues increased 13% to $1,097 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared to $970 million in the same period in 2013, and revenues increased 7% to $2,022 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to $1,893 million in the same period in 2013, reflecting an increase in operational revenues of 14% in the second quarter and 9% in the first six months of 2014. the increases were primarily due to the performance of prevnar 13 in the u.s., primarily reflecting increased purchasing patterns, increased prices and increased demand and a 15% operational increase in the second quarter of 2014 and an 8% operational increase in the first six months of 2014 in international sales of the prevenar family which primarily reflects increased shipments associated with the global alliance for vaccines and immunization as well as the timing of government purchases in various emerging markets compared with the prior periods, partially offset by lower demand due to adverse weather conditions and decreased stockpile purchases. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on vaccines revenues in the second quarter of 2014 and an unfavorable impact of 2% on vaccines revenues in the six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. total vaccines revenues from emerging markets were $319 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $503 million in the first six months of 2014.◦global oncology revenues increased 16% to $570 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared to $493 million in the same period in 2013, and revenues increased 11% to $1,058 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to $949 million in the same period in 2013, reflecting an increase in operational revenues of 16% in the second quarter of 2014 and 12% in the first six months of 2014, due to continued strong uptake of recent product launches, xalkori and inlyta globally, partially offset by a decline in sutent revenues in the u.s., for the first six months of 2014 and certain emerging markets, such as china, for both the second quarter of 2014 and the first six months of 2014 primarily due to the timing of purchases. foreign exchange had no impact on oncology revenues in the second quarter of 2014 and an unfavorable impact of 1% on oncology revenues in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. total oncology revenues from emerging markets were $102 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $177 million in the first six months of 2014.◦consumer healthcare revenues increased 14% to $912 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared to $800 million in the same period in 2013, and revenues increased 4% to $1,673 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to $1,611 million in the same period in 2013, reflecting an increase in operational revenues of 15% in the second quarter of 2014 and 6% in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to the launch of nexium 24hr in late may 2014, partially offset in the first six months of 2014 by a decrease in revenues for respiratory products in the u.s. and canada due to a less severe cold and flu incidence, and for pain management products in the u.s., primarily due to increased competition resulting from the return to the market of certain competing analgesic brands. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on consumer healthcare revenues in the second quarter of 2014 and an unfavorable impact of 2% in the first six months of 2014 on consumer healthcare revenues. total consumer healthcare revenues from emerging markets were $240 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $462 million in the first six months of 2014.•cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2013, primarily due to increased sales of prevnar, at a lower margin, to the global alliance for vaccines and immunization.•selling informational and administrative expenses increased 17% in the second quarter of 2014 and 8% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily driven by consumer healthcare expenses incurred to support the launch of nexium 24hr in the u.s. as well as palbociclib and meningitis b vaccine pre-launch marketing expenses.•research and development expenses increased 16% in the second quarter of 2014 and decreased 1% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to investment in our portfolio primarily to support acceleration of the meningitis b vaccine and palbociclib development programs, for both the second quarter of 2014 and the first six months of 2014 and the completion of oncology phase 3 trials during the first six months of 2014.global established pharmaceutical operating segment•revenues decreased 6%, to $6,513 million in the second quarter of 2014, compared to $6,921 million in the same period in 2013, and decreased 9%, to $12,503 million in the first six months of 2014, compared to $13,782 million in the same period in 2013, 82including a decrease in operational revenues of 5% in the second quarter of 2014 and 7% in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to:◦the loss of exclusivity and subsequent launch of multi-source generic competition for detrol la in the u.s. in january 2014, viagra in most major european markets in june 2013 as well as aricept in canada in december 2013 (aggregate decline of approximately $179 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $351 million in the first six months of 2014);◦the expiration or near-term expiration of the co-promotion collaboration for spiriva in most countries, including the u.s. (where the collaboration expired in april 2014), which, per the terms of the collaboration agreement, has resulted in a decline in pfizer’s share of spiriva revenues (approximately $127 million in the

for additional information about the transfer of certain product rights, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2d. acquisition, divestiture, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: equity-method investments.analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resourceswe rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:•the working capital requirements of our operations, including our research and development activities;•investments in our business;•dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•share repurchases;•the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•paying down outstanding debt;•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•business-development activities.our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service (moody's). see the “credit ratings” section below. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities.86selected measures of liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table provides

additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the “analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets” and “analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows” sections of this md&a.on may 15, 2014, we completed a public offering of $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 7d. financial instruments: long-term debt). domestic and international short-term fundsmany of our operations are conducted outside the u.s., and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. we generally hold approximately 10%-30% of these short-term funds in u.s. tax jurisdictions. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s. federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided.accounts receivablewe continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. historically, payments from a number of these european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale. there have been some improvements, especially in spain, in the amount of outstanding accounts receivable balances in excess of one year.we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on an analysis of the following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistency of payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).as of june 29, 2014, we had about $927 million in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in italy, spain, greece, portugal and ireland where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. such 87receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $83 million, were as follows: $49 million in italy; $17 million in portugal; $11 million in greece; and, $6 million in spain.although certain european governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to appropriately balance repayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.we will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1c. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions included in our 2013 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013.credit ratingstwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s and s&p, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured

2009s&p a-1+ aastable october 2009debt capacitywe have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of june 29, 2014, we had access to $8.5 billion of lines of credit, of which $913 million expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.3 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of the unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2018, may be used to support commercial paper borrowings.global economic conditions––generalthe challenging economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future. see also "global economic conditions––venezuela operations".global economic conditions––venezuela operations our venezuela operations continue to operate with the u.s. dollar as the functional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy. on february 13, 2013, the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 4.3 to 6.3 of venezuelan currency to the u.s. dollar. we incurred a foreign currency loss of $80 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets, and have experienced and expect to continue to experience adverse impacts to our earnings as our revenues and expenses in venezuela continue to be translated into u.s. dollars at the lower 6.3 rate.88in the first quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government expanded the number of exchange mechanisms, such that there are now three official rates of exchange. as of june 29, 2014, these were the cencoex rate of 6.3; the sicad i rate of 10.5; and, the sicad ii rate of 49.96.we continue to use the cencoex rate of 6.3 to report our venezuela financial position, results of operations and cash flows, since we believe that the nature of our business operations in venezuela (the importation, manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products and, to a lesser extent, consumer healthcare goods) would qualify for the most preferential rates permitted by law. we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or whether our use of the 6.3 rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances. further, other potential actions by the venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in venezuela, which could result in an impairment charge and, under extreme circumstances, could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically.as of june 29, 2014, our net monetary assets in venezuela that are subject to revaluation totaled approximately $428 million (remeasured at the 6.3 rate). during the second quarter and first six months of 2014, our revenues from venezuela totaled approximately $195 million and $342 million, respectively, converted using the 6.3 rate.off-balance sheet arrangementsin the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of june 29, 2014, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.share-purchase planon june 27, 2013, we announced that the board of directors had authorized a $10 billion share-purchase plan, and share purchases commenced thereunder in october 2013.in the first six months of 2014, we purchased approximately 82 million shares of our common stock for approximately $2.5 billion under our publicly announced share-purchase plan. in the first six months of 2013, we purchased approximately 280 million shares of our common stock for approximately $7.9 billion under our publicly announced share-purchase plans. after giving effect to share purchases through june 29, 2014, our remaining share-repurchase authorization was approximately $3.0 billion.dividends on common stockin june 2014, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.26 per share, payable september 3, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on august 1, 2014.new accounting standardsrecently adopted accounting standardssee notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 1b. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: adoption of new accounting standards.89recently issued accounting standard, not adopted as of june 29, 2014in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an accounting standards update (asu) on revenue recognition (topic 605), revenue from contracts with customers, with an effective date of january 1, 2017. the guidance introduces a new principles-based framework for revenue recognition and disclosure. we have not yet determined the potential impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements of adopting the new standard, nor have we decided on the method of adoption.forward-looking information and factors that may affect future resultsthis report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” "aim" and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, our anticipated future operating or financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic reviews, capital allocation, plans related to share repurchases and dividends and business-development plans. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans relating to share repurchases and dividends, government regulation and financial results,

pension and postretirement plans during 2014 set forth in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 10. pension and postretirement benefit plans. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:•the outcome of research and development activities including, without limitation, the ability to meet anticipated clinical trial commencement and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for product candidates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data;•decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve our drug applications, which will depend on the assessment by such regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted; and decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of our products;•the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;•the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss of marketing approval for a product or changes in

activities, including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all;•competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates;•the implementation by the fda of an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products to competition from biosimilar products in the u.s., with attendant competitive pressures, after the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period and patent rights;•the ability to meet generic and branded competition after the loss of patent protection for our products or competitor products;•the ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally;•difficulties or delays in manufacturing;•trade buying patterns;90•the impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product exclusivity;•trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment;•the impact of the u.s. budget control act of 2011 (the budget control act) and the deficit-reduction actions to be taken pursuant to the budget control act in order to achieve the deficit-reduction targets provided for therein, and the impact of any broader deficit-reduction efforts;• the impact of u.s. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010—the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act––and of any modification or repeal of any of the provisions thereof;• u.s. federal or state legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including under medicaid, medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs; the importation of prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries; direct-to-consumer advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals; and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines; as well as pricing pressures as a result of highly competitive insurance markets;•legislation or regulatory action in markets outside the u.s. affecting pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including, in particular, continued government-mandated price reductions for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european and emerging market countries and japan and government-imposed access restrictions in certain countries;•the exposure of our operations outside the u.s. to possible capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, as well as political unrest and unstable governments and legal systems;•contingencies related to actual or alleged environmental contamination;•claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates;•any significant breakdown, infiltration or interruption of our information technology systems and infrastructure;•legal defense costs, insurance expenses, settlement costs, the risk of an adverse decision or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to product liability, patent protection, government investigations, consumer, commercial, securities, antitrust, environmental and tax issues, ongoing efforts to explore various means for resolving asbestos litigation, and other legal proceedings;•our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property, both domestically and internationally;•interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates;•governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations, including, without limitation, tax obligations and changes affecting the tax treatment by the u.s. of income earned outside the u.s. that may result from pending and possible future proposals;•any significant issues involving our largest wholesaler customers, which account for a substantial portion of our revenues;•the possible impact of the increased presence of counterfeit medicines in the pharmaceutical supply chain on our revenues and on patient confidence in the integrity of our medicines;•any significant issues that may arise related to the outsourcing of certain operational and staff functions to third parties, including with regard to quality, timeliness and compliance with applicable legal requirements and industry standards;•changes in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles;•uncertainties related to general economic, political, business, industry, regulatory and market conditions including, without limitation, uncertainties related to the impact on us, our customers, suppliers and lenders and counterparties to our foreign-exchange and interest-rate agreements of challenging global economic conditions and recent and possible future changes in global financial markets; and the related risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate;91•any changes in business, political and economic conditions due to actual or threatened terrorist activity in the u.s. and other parts of the world, and related u.s. military action overseas;•growth in costs and expenses;•changes in our product, segment and geographic mix; and•the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internal reorganizations, product recalls and withdrawals and

and of the internal separation of our commercial operations into three new global businesses.we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports and our other filings with the sec.our 2013 annual report on form 10-k listed
