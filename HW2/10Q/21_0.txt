item 2.  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe following supplements management's discussion and analysis of mastercard incorporated for the year ended december 31, 2017 as contained in the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 14, 2018.  it also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated (together, “mastercard” or the “company”), included elsewhere in this report.  percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.business overview mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  through our global payments processing network, we facilitate the switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) of payment transactions and deliver related products and services.  we make payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including mastercard®, maestro®, cirrus® and masterpass®.  our 2017 acquisition of vocalink holdings limited (“vocalink”) has expanded our capability to process automated clearing house (“ach”) transactions, among other things.  as a multi-rail network, we now offer customers one partner to turn to for their payment needs for both domestic and cross-border transactions.  we also provide value-added offerings such as safety and security products, information services and consulting, loyalty and reward programs and issuer and acquirer processing.  our networks are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.  a typical transaction on our core network involves four participants in addition to us: account holder (a consumer who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), merchant, issuer (the account holder’s financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).  we do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our branded products.  in most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution customers.we generate revenues from assessing our customers based on the gross dollar volume (the “gdv”) of activity on the products that carry our brands, from the fees we charge to our customers for providing switching services and from other payment-related products and services.our strategywe grow, diversify and build our business through a combination of organic growth and strategic investments, including acquisitions.  our ability to grow our business is influenced by personal consumption expenditure growth, driving cash and check transactions toward electronic forms of payment, increasing our share in electronic payments and providing value-added products and services.  in addition, our growth will be driven by capturing other payments flows, such as business to business (“b2b”), person to person (“p2p”), business to consumer (“b2c”) and government disbursements, among others.grow.  we focus on growing our core business globally, including growing our consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions, thereby increasing the number of payment transactions we switch.  we also look to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the evolving ways people interact and transact in the growing digital economy.diversify.  we diversify our business by focusing on:•adding new players to our customer base in new and existing markets by working with partners such as governments, merchants, technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) and other businesses•expanding capabilities based on our core network into new areas to provide opportunities for electronic payments and to capture more payment flows, such as b2c transfers, b2b transfers, p2p transfers, including in the areas of transit and government disbursements•driving acceptance at merchants of all sizes•broadening financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked35table of contentsbuild.  we build our business by:•creating and acquiring differentiated products to provide unique, innovative solutions that we bring to market, such as real-time account-based payments, mastercard b2b hub™ and mastercard send™ platforms•providing value-added services across safety and security, consulting, data analytics and loyaltystrategic partners.  we work with a variety of stakeholders.  we provide financial institutions with solutions to help them increase revenue by driving preference for mastercard-branded products.  we help merchants, financial institutions and other organizations by delivering data-driven insights and other services that help them grow and create simple and secure purchase experiences.  we partner with technology companies such as digital players and mobile providers to deliver digital payment solutions powered by our technology, expertise and security protocols.  we help national and local governments drive increased financial inclusion and efficiency, reduce costs, increase transparency to reduce crime and corruption and advance social programs.  for consumers, we provide better, safer and more convenient ways to pay.business environment we authorize, clear and settle transactions in more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies.  net revenue generated in the united states was 32% of total net revenue for both the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018, and 34% and 35% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2017, respectively.  no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total net revenue in each period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time.  while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.  our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro, brazilian real and the british pound. the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, currency fluctuations, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate.  certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and account holders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.our financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  in addition, political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  as a result, our revenue or results of operations may be negatively impacted.  we continue to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry.  notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for us to grow our business.for a full discussion of the various legal, regulatory and business risks that could impact our financial results, see “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of our annual report on form 10-k for

non-gaap results excludes the impact of special items (defined below) and/or foreign currency.  see “non-gaap financial information” for further information on the special items, the impact of foreign currency and the reconciliation to gaap reported amounts.  key highlights for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 were as follows:•net revenue increased 15% and 21%, or 17% and 20% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2017.  current year results include a combined 3 and 4 percentage points of growth, respectively, from the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard and our prior year acquisitions.  the remaining 14 and 16 percentage points of respective growth on a currency-neutral basis was primarily driven by:ø switched transaction growth of 16% and 17%, adjusted for the impact of the venezuela deconsolidation, respectively37table of contentsø cross border growth of 17% and 19% on a local currency basis, respectivelyø gross dollar volume growth of 13% and 14% on a local currency basis, respectively ø these increases were partially offset by higher rebates and incentives, which increased 18% and 19%, or 21% and 19% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively•operating expenses increased 11% and 25% respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2017.  excluding the impact of the special items (defined below), adjusted operating expenses increased 9% and 16%, respectively.  on a currency-neutral basis the increase was 10% and 15%, respectively, primarily driven by:ø 2 and 3 percentage point respective increases from the adoption of the new revenue guidance,ø 3 percentage point increase from acquisitions for the nine months ended september 30, 2018,ø 3 percentage point increase for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 from the contribution to the mastercard center for inclusive growth in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by,ø 2 and 3 percentage point respective benefits from gains associated with foreign exchange activity for derivative contracts net of balance sheet remeasurement losses, as compared to losses in the prior year comparable periods.the remaining 10 percentage points of respective growth for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 was primarily related to our continued investment in strategic initiatives and higher operating costs. •the effective income tax rate was 16.1% and 17.2% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018, versus 26.0% and 26.8%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2017.  the lower effective tax rates, versus the comparable periods in 2017, were primarily due to a lower enacted statutory tax rate in the united states and a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings.  the lower effective tax rates for the periods were also attributable to $65 million of discrete deferred tax benefits, relating primarily to provisions for legal matters in the united states.  additionally, the lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 was attributable to discrete benefits for share-based payments. other financial highlights for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 were as follows:•we generated net cash flows from operations of $4.9 billion compared to $3.8 billion for the comparable period in 2017.•we completed a debt offering for an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion in the first quarter of 2018.•we repurchased 21.8 million shares of our common stock and paid dividends of $785 million.non-gaap financial informationnon-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (“gaap”).  our non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of the following special items (“special items”):•in the third quarter of 2018, we recorded provisions for litigation of $23 million ($17 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share) related to litigation settlements with u.k. merchants and $6 million ($5 million after tax, and a de minimis impact to diluted shares) related to litigation settlements with pan-european merchants.  additionally, we recorded discrete tax benefits of $65 million ($0.06 per diluted share) related primarily to provisions for legal matters in the united states. •in the second quarter of 2018, we recorded provisions for litigation of $210 million ($163 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted share) related to both the u.s. merchant class litigation and the filed and anticipated opt-out u.s. merchant cases.  additionally, we recorded provisions for litigation of $15 million ($12 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) related to litigation settlements with u.k. merchants.•in the first quarter of 2018, we recorded provisions for litigation of $70 million ($53 million after tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) related to litigation settlements with pan-european merchants, $27 million ($21 million after tax, or $0.02 per 38table of contentsdiluted share) related to an increased reserve for our u.s. merchant opt-out cases and $19 million ($15 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) related to litigation settlements with u.k. merchants.•in the first quarter of 2017, we recorded provisions for litigation of $15 million ($10 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) related to a litigation settlement with canadian merchants.we excluded these special items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from litigation judgments and settlements related to interchange and other one-time items, as well as related tax impacts.in addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-gaap financial measure.  currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results.  the impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.  the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  our management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency provides relevant information.our management believes that the non-gaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  our management uses non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. 39table of contentsnet revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items and/or the impact of foreign currency are non-gaap financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with gaap.  the

overall operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency.  the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.   changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives.  in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currencies.  for example, our billing in australia is in the u.s. dollar, however, consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar.  the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our u.s. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated.  the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018, gdv on a u.s. dollar-converted basis increased 9% and 14%, respectively, while gdv on a local currency basis increased 13% and 14%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2017.  further, the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency.in addition, we incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts (“foreign exchange activity”).  the impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results (see “non-gaap financial information”) and is recorded in general and administrative expenses.  we attempt to manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through our foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 16 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.  since we do not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, we record gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize.we are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries.  in addition, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict the conversion of financial assets into u.s. dollars.  while these revenues and assets are not material to us on a consolidated basis, we can be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries. 41table of contentsfinancial resultsrevenuein the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018, gross revenue increased 16% and 21%, or 18% and 20% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2017.  gross revenue growth in the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 was driven by an increase in transactions, dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and other payment-related products and services.  rebates and incentives, in the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018, increased 18% and 19%, or 21% and 19% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2017, primarily due to new and renewed deals and increased volumes.  our net revenue for the three

we no longer collect fees on domestic european economic area payment transactions that do not use our network brand.  prior to that, we collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries, particularly france, on transactions with mastercard co-badged cards if the brands of domestic networks (as opposed to mastercard) were used.  as a result, the non-mastercard co-badged volume is no longer being included.the following table reflects gdv growth rates for europe and worldwide mastercard.  for comparability purposes, we adjusted growth rates for the impact of article 8 of the eu

table may not sum due to rounding.** not meaningful.the primary drivers of general and administrative expenses for three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 versus the comparable periods in 2017 are as follows:•personnel expenses increased 14% and 21%, or 15% and 20% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively.  the increase was due to a higher number of employees to support our continued investment in the areas of digital infrastructure, safety and security platforms and data analytics as well as geographic expansion.  the impact from acquisitions was de minimis for the three months ended september 30, 2018 and contributed 3 percentage points to expense growth for the nine months ended september 30, 2018. •data processing and telecommunication expenses increased 14% and 19%, or 14% and 18% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, due to capacity growth of our business.  the impact from acquisitions was de minimis for the three months ended september 30, 2018 and contributed 5 percentage points to expense growth for the nine months ended september 30, 2018. •foreign exchange activity contributed a benefit of 2 and 4 percentage points, respectively.  for the three months ended september 30, 2018, we recorded gains from our foreign exchange derivative contracts primarily related to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, fully offset by balance sheet remeasurement losses.  for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 we recorded gains from our foreign exchange derivative contracts primarily related to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, partially offset by balance sheet remeasurement losses.  this compares to losses from both our foreign exchange derivative contracts and balance sheet remeasurement in the prior year comparable periods.  •other expenses remained relatively flat for the three months ended september 30, 2018.  for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 other expenses increased 20 percentage points primarily due to the contribution to the mastercard center for inclusive growth, a non-profit charitable organization.  the remaining increase was due to costs to support our strategic development efforts.  other expenses include costs to provide loyalty and rewards solutions, travel and meeting expenses, rental expense for our facilities and other costs associated with our business.  advertising and marketingadvertising and marketing expenses increased 15% and 18%, or 18% and 17% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2017, primarily due to a change in accounting for certain marketing fund arrangements as a result of our adoption of the new revenue guidance, partially offset by a net decrease in spending on certain marketing campaigns.  for a more detailed discussion on the impact of the new revenue guidance, refer to note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies).depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expenses decreased 6% or 5% on a currency- neutral basis, for the three months ended september 30, 2018 versus the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets.  depreciation and amortization expenses increased 8% or 7% on a currency-neutral basis, for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 versus the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions partially offset by the full amortization of certain intangible assets.  46table of contentsprovision for litigation settlementsin the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018, we recorded $29 million and $371 million in provisions for various litigations, respectively, versus $15 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.  see section entitled “non-gaap financial information” in this section and note 14 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion.other income (expense)other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments, certain income (expense) from our defined benefit plans and other gains and losses.  total other expense increased $14 million for the three months ended september 30, 2018 versus the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in february 2018 and the lapping of a gain relating to an investment we had in a company that we acquired in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher investment income.  for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 total other income (expense) remained relatively flat.income taxes the effective income tax rates were 16.1% and 17.2% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 versus 26.0% and 26.8%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2017.  the lower effective tax rates, versus the comparable periods in 2017, were primarily due to a lower enacted statutory tax rate in the united states and a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings.  on december 22, 2017, the u.s. passed comprehensive tax legislation (the “u.s. tax reform”) which, among other things, reduces the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2018.  these benefits were partially offset by other aspects of the u.s. tax reform for which a tax benefit is no longer recognized, including a u.s. foreign tax credit benefit for the repatriation of current year foreign earnings and the domestic production activities deduction.  the lower effective tax rates for the periods were also attributable to $65 million of discrete deferred tax benefits, relating primarily to provisions for legal matters in the united states.  see note 14 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion of the u.s. merchant class litigation.  additionally, the lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 was attributable to discrete benefits related to share-based payments.liquidity and capital resourceswe rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.  the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us at september 30, 2018 and december 31, 2017: september 30, 2018 december 31, 2017 (in billions)cash, cash equivalents and investments 1$8.5 $7.8unused line of credit3.8 3.81 investments include available-for-sale securities and short-term held-to-maturity securities.  at september 30, 2018 and december 31, 2017, this amount excludes restricted cash related to the u.s. merchant class litigation settlement of $550 million and $546 million, respectively.  this amount also excludes restricted security deposits held for customers of $1.0 billion at september 30, 2018 and $1.1 billion at december 31, 2017.as a result of the enactment of the u.s. tax reform, among other things, we have changed our assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the u.s. for certain of our foreign affiliates.  see note 13 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion.  it is our present intention to indefinitely reinvest a portion of our historic undistributed accumulated earnings associated with certain foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states.  based upon the ongoing review of business requirements and capital needs of our non-u.s. subsidiaries, we believe a portion of these undistributed earnings that have already been subject to tax in the u.s. will be necessary to fund current and future growth of the related businesses and will remain indefinitely reinvested outside of the u.s.  in 2018, we continue to review our global working capital and cash needs to determine the amount we consider indefinitely reinvested.  we will disclose such amount in the period in which such analysis is completed.our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  we guarantee the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers.  see note 15 (settlement and 47table of contentsother risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part i, item 1 of this report for a description of these guarantees.  historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses.  the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see part i, item 1a - risk factors of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2017; note 14 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report; and “business environment” within this section of this report.cash flowthe table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months

used in investing activities decreased $1,386 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2018, versus the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to prior year acquisitions and higher net proceeds from investment securities in the current period.net cash used in financing activities increased $339 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2018, versus the comparable period in 2017, due to higher repurchases of our class a common stock, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of debt in the current period.the table below shows a summary of select balance sheet

principal amount of notes due in 2048.  our total debt outstanding (including the current portion) was $6.4 billion and $5.4 billion at september 30, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively, with the earliest maturity of $500 million of principal occurring in april 2019.we have a commercial paper program (the “commercial paper program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $3.75 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.  in conjunction with the commercial paper program, we entered into a committed unsecured $3.75 billion revolving credit facility (the “credit facility”) which expires in october 2022. borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers.  in addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes.  we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility at september 30, 2018 and december 31, 2017. in march 2018, we filed a universal shelf registration statement (replacing a previously filed shelf registration statement that was set to expire) to provide additional access to capital, if needed. pursuant to the shelf registration statement, we may from time to time offer to sell debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred stock, class a common stock, depository shares, purchase contracts, units or warrants in one or more offerings.see note 9 (debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion of long-term debt, the commercial paper program and the credit facility.  dividends and share repurchaseswe have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock.  subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend.  however, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our
