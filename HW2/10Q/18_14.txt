item 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsour management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. md&a is organized as follows:•overview. discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of md&a.•results of operations. an analysis of our financial results comparing the three months ended march 29, 2014 to the three months ended march 30, 2013.•liquidity and capital resources. an analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity.•fair value of financial instruments. discussion of the methodologies used in the valuation of our financial instruments.this interim md&a should be read in conjunction with the md&a in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 28, 2013. the various sections of this md&a contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of our annual report on form 10-k, and as may be updated in our subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q. our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of april 25, 2014.overviewour results of operations for each period were as follows:(dollars in millions, except per share amounts) q1 2014 q4 2013 change q1 2014 q1 2013 changenet

$12.8 billion was down 8% sequentially, in line with our expectations, and up 1% from a year ago. we are seeing continued signs of stabilization in the pc business as unit sales grew year-over-year for the second quarter in a row, with improvements in our enterprise client sales being partially offset by continued softness in consumer purchases. our pc client group (pccg) platform average selling prices declined 3% on a year-over-year basis. additionally, the data center group (dcg) continues to benefit from growth in internet cloud computing and networking with continued strengthening of the enterprise market segments. for q2 2014, we are forecasting revenue of $13.0 billion, plus or minus $500 million, which is a 2% increase from q1 2014 and in line with the average seasonal increase. for the full year 2014, we continue to anticipate revenues to be approximately flat to 2013. we expect pccg revenue to decline in the mid-single digits and dcg revenue to grow in the low double digits. 32intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)our gross margin percentage in q1 2014 declined sequentially on higher pre-qualification product costs on our 5th generation intel® core™ processor family (code-named “broadwell”). lower sell-through of previously qualified units and lower platform unit sales also contributed to the decrease. these decreases were partially offset by lower factory start-up costs. gross margin percentage for q2 2014 is expected to be approximately three percentage points higher when compared to q1 2014 due to lower factory start-up costs as we ramp our next generation 14-nanometer (nm) process technology. in addition, we expect higher platform unit sales and lower platform pre-qualification product costs as we qualify our first 14nm products. these increases are partially offset by the increase in tablet volume and the related cash consideration provided to our customers to meet competition by offsetting a higher bill of materials and system level costs associated with integrating our tablet platform.in q1 2014, we began production on our 14nm process technology and remain on track to launch our 5th generation intel core processor family in the second half of this year. we also shipped our first intel® quark™ system-on-chip (soc) 32-bit microprocessor built for the internet of things market segment. in the mobile and communications market segment, we launched our 64-bit intel® atom™ processor (code-named “merrifield”) offering fast, smart performance, and longer battery life for the smartphone and tablet market segments. additionally, our first generation lte solution is now available in the samsung galaxy* note 3 neo and the asus fonepad* 7.in addition to the products launched during q1 2014, we also introduced the next generation small-core soc built on 14nm process technology (code-named “braswell”). braswell is designed for entry-level 2 in 1 systems, notebooks, desktops, and all-in-one pc platforms. in the data center market segment, we introduced the next generation intel® xeon® processor e7 family-based servers using our 22nm process technology. in the wireless business, we are on track to start shipping our second generation lte solution, featuring cat6 and carrier aggregation, in q2 2014. additionally, we expect in the second half of the year to have available our first integrated soc application processor and baseband 3g solution (code-named "sofia") and our next-generation 64-bit intel atom processor (code-named "moorefield").  the cash generation from our business remains strong, with cash from operations of $3.5 billion in q1 2014. we ended q1 2014 with an investment portfolio of $19.0 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. during q1 2014, we purchased $2.7 billion in capital assets and returned cash to shareholders by both paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $545 million of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. in march 2014, the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.225 per common share to be paid in june 2014.  our business outlook for q2 2014 and full-year 2014 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general and administrative (mg&a)), and capital expenditures. we will keep our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10-q. the statements in the business outlook and forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and at other times. the forward-looking statements in the business outlook will be effective through the close of business on june 13, 2014 unless updated earlier. from the close of business on june 13, 2014 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for july 15, 2014, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet period, the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on april 15, 2014, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the sec, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.33results of operations – first quarter of 2014 compared to first quarter of 2013 certain consolidated condensed statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for each period

sales increased by 1% while pccg and dcg platform average selling prices were flat primarily on continued signs of stabilization in the traditional pc business. additionally, higher internet of things group (iotg) platform unit sales and average selling prices as well as non-volatile memory solutions group revenue contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by lower mobile and communications group (mcg) phone component unit sales. our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2014 increased by $547 million, or 8%, compared to q1 2013. the increase was due to approximately $385 million of lower pccg and dcg platform unit costs and approximately $270 million of lower excess capacity charges. to a lesser extent, higher pccg and dcg platform revenue contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by approximately $165 million of higher factory start-up costs primarily for our next-generation 14nm process technology. in addition, lower mcg phone components revenue contributed to the decrease.our overall gross margin percentage increased to 59.6% in q1 2014 from 56.2% in q1 2013. the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage increase in pccg and dcg. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in q1 2014 and q1 2013 from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg operating segments. pc client groupthe revenue and operating income for the pccg operating segment for each period were as follows:(in millions) q1 2014 q1 2013net revenue $7,941 $8,054operating income $2,802 $2,488net revenue for the pccg operating segment decreased by $113 million, or 1%, in q1 2014 compared to q1 2013. pccg platform average selling prices were down 3% while pccg platform unit sales were up 1%. the decrease in revenue was driven by lower notebook platform average selling prices, which were down 8%. this decrease was partially offset by desktop platform average selling prices and unit sales, which were up 4% and flat, respectively. to a lesser extent, higher notebook unit sales of 2% offset the decrease.34operating income increased by $314 million, or 13%, in q1 2014 compared to q1 2013, which was driven by $300 million of higher gross margin and $14 million of lower operating expenses. the increase in gross margin was driven by approximately $325 million of lower pccg platform unit costs and approximately $200 million of lower excess capacity charges. these increases were partially offset by lower pccg platform revenue.data center groupthe revenue and operating income for the

internet cloud computing and networking with continued strengthening of the enterprise market segments.operating income increased $173 million, or 15%, in q1 2014 compared to q1 2013 with $344 million of higher gross margin partially offset by $171 of higher operating expenses. gross margin was positively impacted by higher platform revenue, approximately $60 million of lower dcg platform unit costs, and approximately $45 million of lower excess capacity charges. these were partially offset by higher operating expenses and approximately $90 million of higher factory start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology. internet of things groupthe revenue and operating income for the iotg operating segment for each period were as follows:(in millions) q1 2014 q1 2013net

decrease was primarily due to lower phone components unit sales. additionally, we provided cash consideration to our customers to meet competition by offsetting a higher bill of materials and system level costs associated with integrating our tablet platform. these decreases were partially offset by higher tablet platform unit sales.operating results for the mcg operating segment decreased by $226 million in q1 2014 compared to q1 2013 with $165 million of lower gross margin and $61 million of higher operating expenses. the decline in operating results was primarily due to lower phone components revenue, higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales, and higher cash consideration provided to customers. additionally, higher operating expenses contributed to the decrease. these decreases were partially offset by lower tablet platform unit costs.35software and services operating segmentsthe revenue and operating income (loss) for the software and services

r&d spending increased by $319 million, or 13%, in q1 2014 compared to q1 2013. this increase was primarily driven by higher 10nm process technology development costs and higher compensation expenses mainly due to an increase in employees as well as annual salary increases.marketing, general and administrative. mg&a expenses increased by $100 million, or 5%, in q1 2014 compared to q1 2013. this increase was primarily driven by a current-period charge related to ongoing litigation.restructuring and asset impairment charges. in response to the current business environment, beginning in the third quarter of 2013, management approved several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions as well as exit of certain businesses and facilities. these actions include the wind down of our 200 millimeter wafer fabrication facility in massachusetts, which we expect to cease production by the end of 2014. these targeted reductions will enable the company to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the changing market. restructuring and asset impairment charges for each period were as follows: (in millions) q1 2014 q1 2013employee severance

charges in the consolidated condensed statements of income and within the “all other” operating segments category. the charges incurred during q1 2014 included $137 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements, which impacted approximately 2,200 employees. the accrued restructuring balance as of march 29, 2014 relates to employee severance and benefits which are expected to be paid within the next 12 months and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated condensed balance sheets.since q3 2013, we have incurred a total of $377 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges. these charges included a total of $338 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,100 employees, and $39 million in asset impairment charges. we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately$500 million, which will be realized within r&d, cost of sales, and mg&a. we began to realize these savings in q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in q2 2015.we may incur additional charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements, as well as facility-related or other exit activities, as we continue to align our resources to meet the needs of the business.gains (losses) on equity

changes in assets and liabilities.for q1 2014 compared to q1 2013, the $784 million decrease in cash provided by operations was due to changes in working capital and lower net income. income taxes paid, net of refunds, in q1 2014 compared to q1 2013 were $371 million higher due to 2012 income tax overpayments reducing income taxes paid in q1 2013.changes in assets and liabilities as of march 29, 2014, compared to december 28, 2013, included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits due to the payout of 2013 profit-dependent compensation, and a decrease in inventories due to lower unit costs as we benefit from economies of scale with our 4th generation intel core processor family products.for q1 2014, our three largest customers accounted for 42% of net revenue (38% in q1 2013) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 15% of our net revenue (15% in q1 2013), dell inc. accounting for 15% of our net revenue (14% in q1 2013), and lenovo group limited accounting for 12% of our net revenue (9% in q1 2013). these three customers accounted for 33% of net accounts receivable as of march 29, 2014 (34% as of december 28, 2013).investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.the decrease in cash used for investing activities in q1 2014 compared to q1 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of trading assets and available-for-sale investments and an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments, partially offset by a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets and a decrease in capital expenditures.financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans.liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of march 29, 2014, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $19.0 billion ($20.1 billion as of december 28, 2013). in addition to the $19.0 billion, we have $2.2 billion in other long-term investments, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, which was fully available for use as of march 29, 2014. this ongoing authorization includes our commercial paper program. there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during q1 2014. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of march 29, 2014. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.38intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)as of march 29, 2014, $11.0 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $11.0 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $1.9 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of march 29, 2014. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 2: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of march 29, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $20.1 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $7.2 billion was classified as level 1, $12.8 billion as level 2, and $81 million as level 3.our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $12.8 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 55% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 45% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3, are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of march 29, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $813 million of loans receivable and $150 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of march 29, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.1 billion of marketable equity securities. all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.39
