attributable to chevron corporation for third quarter 2012 was $5.3 billion ($2.69 per share — diluted), compared with $7.8 billion ($3.92 per share — diluted) in the corresponding 2011 period. net income attributable to chevron corporation for the first nine months of 2012 was $18.9 billion ($9.62 per share — diluted), versus $21.8 billion ($10.86 per share — diluted) in the first nine months of 2011.upstream earnings in third quarter 2012 were $5.1 billion, compared with $6.2 billion in the 2011 quarter. the decrease was mainly due to lower crude oil volumes and realizations. earnings for the first nine months of 2012 were $16.9 billion, versus $19.0 billion a year earlier. the decrease between the comparative periods was mainly due to lower crude oil volumes, higher exploration expenses and higher operating expenses. partially offsetting these effects was a nearly $600 million gain on sale of an equity interest in the wheatstone project.downstream earnings were $689 million in third quarter 2012, compared with $2.0 billion in the year-earlier period. the decline was mainly due to lower gains on asset sales, an unfavorable change in effects on derivative instruments, and lower margins. earnings for the first nine months of 2012 were $3.4 billion, versus $3.7 billion in the corresponding 2011 period. the decrease between comparative periods was mainly due to a decline in gains from asset sales.refer to pages 28 through 30 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for third quarter and first nine months of 2012 versus the same period in 2011.business environment and outlookchevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela, and vietnam.23table of contentsearnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments. the single biggest factor that affects the results of operations for the company is movement in the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year.to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required. identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments.the company’s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the united states. from time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company. governments may attempt to do so in the future. civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the company’s operations or investments. those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.the company also continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. refer to the “results of operations” section, beginning on page 28, for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2012. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company monitors developments closely in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.24table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $111 per barrel for the full-year 2011. during third quarter 2012, brent averaged $110 per barrel and ended october at about $110. the wti price averaged $95 per barrel for the full-year 2011. during third quarter 2012, wti averaged $92 per barrel and ended october at about $86. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2011 and 2012 due to high inventories in the u.s. midcontinent market driven by strong growth in domestic production.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the differential widened in the third quarter of 2012 primarily due to strong diesel prices and low petroleum product inventories.chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, chad, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 33 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $2.51 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in the first nine months of 2012, compared with $4.24 during the first nine months of 2011. at the end of october 2012, the henry hub spot price was $3.51 per mcf. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america. the henry hub gas price declined during first quarter 2012 due to high inventories resulting from a mild winter and continued growth in u.s. gas production. the henry hub price has strengthened since april due to strong gas demand for power generation, flat production and less surplus inventories.outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. international natural gas realizations averaged $6.00 per mcf during the first nine months of 2012, compared with $5.33 in the same period last year. (see page 33 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)the company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2012 averaged 2.59 million barrels per day. about one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2012 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for third quarter 2012 or 2011. at their latest meeting in june 2012, members of opec supported maintaining the collective production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day agreed upon in december 2011.25table of contentsproduction in any given year is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including additional quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups or ramp-ups, or fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the united states.the company estimates that net oil-equivalent production for the full-year 2012 will average about 97 percent of the previously-announced target of 2.680 million barrels per day. the production shortfall is primarily due to the shut-in of the frade field in brazil and the timing of start-up of lng production in angola.on november 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field about 75 miles offshore brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. upon detection, the company immediately took steps to stop the release. chevron’s emergency plan, approved by the brazilian environment and natural resources regulatory agency ibama, was implemented according to the law and industry standards. the source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well has been plugged and abandoned. no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to this seep has emerged. on march 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. as a precautionary measure, the company and its partners decided to temporarily suspend field production and received approval from brazil’s national petroleum agency (anp) to do so. the company also installed special containment devices on the seafloor to capture the oil and will install additional devices if needed. chevron and its partners continue to cooperate with the brazilian authorities and are conducting studies to better understand the geology in the area. on july 19, 2012, anp issued its final investigative report on the november 2011 incident. on august 16, 2012, chevron submitted to anp a plan for restarting limited production in the frade field. a brazilian federal district prosecutor has filed two civil lawsuits seeking $10.7 billion in damages for each of the two seeps. the company is not aware of any basis for damages to be awarded in any civil lawsuit. on july 31, 2012, a court presiding over the civil litigation entered a preliminary injunction barring chevron from conducting oil production and transportation activities in brazil pending completion of the legal proceedings commenced by the federal prosecutor and the ongoing proceedings of anp and ibama. on september 28, 2012, the injunction was modified to clarify that chevron may continue its containment and mitigation activities under supervision of anp. the federal prosecutor has also filed criminal charges against 11 chevron employees. with regard to criminal charges, the company believes them to be without merit and intends to aggressively defend the company and the named employees. jurisdiction has been moved for all three matters from campos to a court in rio de janeiro. the company’s ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable, but could be significant to net income in any one period.the company entered into a non-binding financing term sheet with petroboscan, a joint stock company owned 39.2 percent by chevron, which operates the boscan field in venezuela. when finalized, the financing is expected to occur in stages over a limited drawdown period and is intended to support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreed-upon level. the terms are designed to support cash needs for on-going operations and new development, as well as distributions to shareholders — including current outstanding obligations. the loan will be repaid from future petroboscan crude sales. definitive documents are under negotiation.refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 28 through 29 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by 26table of contentsinventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of the crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. the company has further progressed its ongoing effort to concentrate downstream resources and capital on strategic assets. in march 2012, the company completed the sale of its fuels and finished lubricants businesses in spain. in july 2012, the company completed the sale of its perth amboy, new jersey, refinery, which had been operated as a products terminal in recent years.  in april and july 2012, the company completed the sales of several of its fuels marketing and aviation businesses in the caribbean, and expects to complete the remaining announced sales of certain fuels marketing and aviation businesses in the caribbean during the fourth quarter of 2012.in july 2012, caltex australia ltd. (cal), the company’s 50 percent-owned affiliate, announced that it plans to convert its kurnell refinery to an import terminal in 2014. as a result of this decision, chevron recognized restructuring-related charges  which are not material to its consolidated results of operations.refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 29 through 30 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels and technology companies.operating developmentsnoteworthy operating developments for the upstream business in recent months included the following:•australia - completed the acquisition of additional interest in the clio and acme fields in the carnarvon basin in exchange for chevron's interest in the browse development. consolidating interests in the carnarvon basin fits strategically with long-term plans to grow the wheatstone area resource base, and create expansion opportunities for the wheatstone project.•australia - completed the sale of an equity interest in the wheatstone project to tokyo electric. •australia - announced two natural gas discoveries, satyr-2 and satyr-4, in the carnarvon basin in 50 percent-owned block wa-374-p. •sierra leone - awarded a 55 percent interest and operatorship in two deepwater exploration blocks.•united states - announced an agreement to acquire additional acreage in new mexico. the acreage is located in the delaware basin where the company is already one of the largest leaseholders.in the downstream business, the company's 50 percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc announced that its 35 percent-owned saudi polymers company began commercial production at its petrochemical project in al-jubail, saudi arabia.  also in the third quarter, the company completed the sale of its idled perth amboy, new jersey, refinery, which had been operating as a terminal, and two of its fuels marketing businesses in the caribbean. the company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in third quarter 2012 under its share repurchase program.27table of contentsresults of operationsbusiness segments the following section presents the results of operations for the company’s business segments — upstream and downstream — as well as for “all other.” (refer to note 4, on page 9, for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments,” as defined under the accounting standards for segment reporting.)upstream three months endedseptember 30 nine months ended september 30 2012 2011 2012 2011 (millions of dollars)     u.s. upstream earnings$1,122 $1,508 $3,969 $4,907u.s. upstream earnings of $1.12 billion in third quarter 2012 decreased $386 million from the same period last year. the decrease was due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations of about $150 million and $90 million, respectively, and decreased net oil-equivalent production of about $95 million.earnings for the first nine months of 2012 were $3.97 billion, down $938 million from the corresponding period in 2011. the decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil production of $310 million, lower natural gas realizations of $300 million, higher operating expenses of $100 million and an absence of gains on assets sales of $110 million.the company’s average realization per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in third quarter 2012 was $91, down from $97 a year earlier. for both of the nine-month periods, average realizations were $97. the average natural gas realization in third quarter 2012 was $2.63 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $4.14 in the year-ago period. the average nine-month realizations were $2.43 in 2012 and $4.18 in 2011.net oil-equivalent production of 637,000 barrels per day in third quarter 2012 was down 25,000 barrels per day, or about 4 percent, from a year earlier. the decrease in production was associated with normal field declines and an absence of volumes associated with cook inlet, alaska, assets sold in 2011, and the effects of storm-related shut-ins in 2012 in the gulf of mexico. partially offsetting this decrease was ramp-up at the perdido and caesar/tonga projects in the gulf of mexico. nine months 2012 production was 649,000 barrels per day, down 35,000 from the corresponding 2011 period. the decrease was associated with normal field declines and an absence of volumes associated with cook inlet, alaska, assets sold in 2011. partially offsetting this decrease was production from continued ramp-up at the perdido and caesar/tonga projects in the gulf of mexico, as well as volumes from the marcellus shale.the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production was 440,000 barrels per day and 452,000 barrels per day for third quarter and nine months of 2012, respectively. those volumes were 3 percent and 4 percent lower than the corresponding 2011 periods, respectively. net natural gas production was 1.18 billion cubic feet per day in both 2012 periods, decreasing 6 percent and 8 percent from the comparative third quarter and 9 months 2011 periods, respectively. excluding the impact of the cook inlet assets sold in 2011, natural gas production was essentially flat for the quarterly period and decreased 1% for the first nine months of 2012. three months endedseptember 30 nine months ended september 30 2012 2011 2012 2011 (millions of

$4.0 billion in third quarter 2012 decreased $676 million from the corresponding period in 2011. the decline between quarters was primarily due to lower crude oil volumes of about $440 million and lower realizations for crude oil of about $210 million, as well as higher exploration expense of about $240 million. partially offsetting these effects was a nearly $600 million gain on sale of an equity interest in the wheatstone project and lower tax items of about $200 million. foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $252 million in the 2012 quarter, compared with an increase of $304 million a year earlier.28table of contentsearnings for the first nine months of 2012 were $12.96 billion, down $1.18 billion from the same period in 2011. the decrease was mainly due to lower crude oil volumes of about $1.1 billion, higher exploration expenses of about $450 million, higher operating expenses of about $240 million and higher depreciation expense of about $200 million. partially offsetting these effects was a benefit of higher crude oil and natural gas realizations of about $700 million and a nearly $600 million gain on sale of an equity interest in the wheatstone project. foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $241 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared with an increase of $214 million a year earlier.the average realization per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in third quarter 2012 and nine-month period were $98 and $103, respectively, compared with $103 and $102 in the corresponding 2011 periods. the average natural gas realization per thousand cubic feet in third quarter 2012 was $6.03, compared with $5.50 in the corresponding 2011 period. between the nine-month periods, the average natural gas realization increased to $6.00 from $5.33.international net oil-equivalent production of 1.88 million barrels per day in third quarter 2012 decreased 58,000 barrels per day from a year ago. production increases from project ramp-ups in thailand and nigeria were more than offset by planned maintenance-related downtime, continued shut-in of the frade field in brazil and normal field declines. international net oil-equivalent production of 1.94 million barrels per day for the nine months of 2012 decreased 59,000 barrels per day from a year ago. production increases from project ramp-ups in thailand and nigeria were more than offset by normal field declines, maintenance-related downtime and the shut-in of the frade field in brazil.the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production was 1.25 million barrels per day in third quarter 2012 and 1.30 million barrels per day in the nine-month period, decreases of 8 and 6 percent for the respective periods. net natural gas production totaled 3.78 billion cubic feet per day in third quarter 2012 and 3.84 billion cubic feet per day in the first nine months, increases of 8 percent and 5 percent, from the respective 2011

pembroke refinery and related marketing assets in the united kingdom and ireland. an unfavorable change in effects on derivative instruments of $180 million also contributed to the lower earnings in the 2012 quarter. foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $43 million in the 2012 quarter, compared with an increase of $148 million a year earlier.earnings for the first nine months of 2012

quarters were 47 percent and 41 percent, respectively. the increase was primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement impacts and an increased percentage of earnings in international jurisdictions with high tax rates. the impact from non-u.s. upstream asset sales on the effective tax rate in the current quarter was essentially offset by the effect of non-u.s. downstream asset sales in the comparative 2011 period. for the year-to-date periods, the effective tax rates were 45 and 42 percent for 2012 and 2011, respectively. the increase primarily reflected a lower utilization of tax credits in non-u.s. jurisdictions in the current period and foreign currency remeasurement impacts between periods.32table of contentsselected operating datathe following table presents a comparison

at september 30, 2012, up $1.5 billion from year-end 2011. cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2012 was $26.0 billion, compared with $32.0 billion in the year-ago period. dividends the company paid dividends of $5.1 billion to common shareholders during the first nine months of 2012. in october 2012 the company declared a quarterly dividend of 90 cents per common share, payable in december 2012.debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $12.3 billion at september 30, 2012, up from $10.2 billion at december 31, 2011.the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the authorized borrowing limit under this program is $12.0 billion and the outstanding balance at september 30, 2012 was $4.9 billion. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $8.2 billion at september 30, 2012 and $5.9 billion at december 31, 2011. of these amounts, $6.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at september 30, 2012 and $5.6 billion at december 31, 2011, respectively. at september 30, 2012, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at september 30, 2012, the company had $6.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in december 2016, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at september 30, 2012. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in march 2013 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation, chevron corporation profit sharing/savings plan trust fund and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poor’s corporation and aa1 by moody’s investors service. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. the company also can modify capital spending plans during periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the company’s high-quality debt ratings.common share repurchase program in july 2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. the company expects to repurchase between $500 million and $2 billion of its common shares per quarter, at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. during third quarter 2012, the company purchased 11.3 million common shares for $1.25 billion. from the inception of the program through third quarter 2012, the company purchased 86.2 million shares for $8.8 billion.noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $1.3 billion and $799 million at september 30, 2012 and december 31, 2011, respectively. distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $23 million during the first nine months of 2012.34table of contentscurrent ratio — current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. the current ratio was 1.6 at september 30, 2012 and 1.6 at december 31, 2011. the current ratio is adversely affected by the fact that chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. at september 30, 2012, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement cost.debt ratio — total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. this ratio was 8.5 percent at september 30, 2012, and 7.7 percent at year-end 2011.pension
