overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook


our business


our mission is to apply science and our global resources to improve health and well-being at every stage of life. we strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacturing of medicines for people and animals. our diversified global healthcare portfolio includes human and animal biologic and small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as nutritional products and many of the world’s best-known consumer products. every day, we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we also collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues are derived from the sale of our products, as well as through alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies.


on july 7, 2011, we announced our decision to explore strategic alternatives for our animal health and nutrition businesses and noted that they may include, among other things, a full or partial separation of each of these businesses from pfizer through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. on april 23, 2012, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our nutrition operating segment to nestlé for $11.85 billion in cash. the transaction is expected to close by the first half of 2013, assuming the receipt of the required regulatory clearances and satisfaction of the other closing conditions. as a result of our decision to divest this business, the nutrition business will be presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented on a retroactive basis beginning in the second quarter of 2012. therefore, all revenues and expenses related to the nutrition business will be presented in a single line, discontinued operations––net of tax. additionally, the assets and liabilities associated with this business will be classified as assets of discontinued operations and other assets held for sale and liabilities of discontinued operations, as appropriate, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. we expect to finalize a strategic decision for our animal health business in 2012 and to complete any separation of this business by july 2013. (for more information, see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a).


on august 1, 2011, we completed the sale of our capsugel business. in connection with our decision to sell, the operating results associated with the capsugel business are classified as discontinued operations––net of tax in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three months ended april 3, 2011. (for more information, see the “our business development initiatives” and “discontinued operations" sections of this md&a.)


our first quarter 2012 performance


revenues in the first quarter of 2012 were $15.4 billion, a decrease of 7% compared to the same period in 2011, due to an operational decline of $1.0 billion, or 6%, primarily as the result of the impact of the u.s. loss of exclusivity of lipitor on november 30, 2011, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $57 million, or less than 1%.

lipitor lost exclusivity in the u.s. in november 2011, japan in june 2011, canada in may 2010, spain in july 2010, brazil in august 2010 and mexico in december 2010. xalatan lost exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2011 and in the majority of european markets in january 2012. caduet lost exclusivity in the u.s. in november 2011. effexor xr lost exclusivity in the u.s. in july 2010. aromasin lost exclusivity in the u.s. in april 2011 and in the majority of european markets and japan in july 2011. vfend tablets lost exclusivity in the u.s. in february 2011. zosyn lost exclusivity in the u.s. in september 2009. geodon lost exclusivity in the u. s. in march 2012. we lost exclusivity for aricept 5mg and 10mg tablets, which are included in alliance revenues, in the u.s. in november 2010 and in many of the major european markets in february 2012.



(c)


includes the “all other” category included in the revenues—major biopharmaceutical products table presented in this md&a, which includes sales of generic atorvastatin.



(d)


 includes revenues generated primarily from pfizer centresource, our contract manufacturing and bulk pharmaceutical chemical sales organization.


* calculation not meaningful.


 
income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2012 was $1.8 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting, in addition to the factors discussed above relating to revenues:






  


●


charges for certain legal matters that were approximately $313 million higher in the first quarter of 2012 than in the same period in 2011 (see further discussion in the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 4. other deductions––net);









  


●


asset impairment charges that were approximately $275 million higher in the first quarter of 2012 than in the same period in 2011 (see further discussion in the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 4. other deductions––net);









  


●


higher charges of $245 million in 2012 compared to 2011 related to our non-acquisition related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; and





partially offset by:
 





  


●


lower purchase accounting impacts of $326 million in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011; and




 




  


●


lower acquisition-related costs of $393 million in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.

our operating environment


u.s. healthcare legislation


in march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (together, the u.s. healthcare legislation), was enacted in the u.s. as explained more fully in our 2011 annual report on form 10-k, this legislation has resulted in both current and longer-term impacts on us. our 2012 financial guidance (see the “our financial guidance for 2012” section of this md&a for additional information) reflects the expected full-year impact of the u.s. healthcare legislation.
 
in each of the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, we recorded the following amounts as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation:






  


●


approximately $123.4 million and $166.2 million, respectively, recorded as a reduction to revenues, related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and









  


●


approximately $103.4 million and $69.3 million, respectively, recorded in selling, informational and administrative expenses, related to the annual fee payable to the federal government (which is payable annually through 2018 and is not deductible for u.s. income tax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs.






the u.s. supreme court is considering whether the requirement in the u.s. healthcare legislation for americans to have insurance (called the individual mandate) is constitutional, whether other portions of the u.s. healthcare legislation should stand if the individual mandate is found unconstitutional, whether the courts have jurisdiction to consider these issues before the individual mandate takes effect in 2014, and whether the u.s. healthcare legislation's expansion of medicaid unconstitutionally encroaches on states' autonomy. we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. in addition, congress may withhold all or a portion of the funding necessary to implement the u.s. healthcare legislation or may attempt to amend or repeal it. given the extent of the possible changes and the uncertainties concerning the interpretation, implementation and timing of the changes, the u.s. healthcare legislation and any amendments thereto or any repeal of all or portions thereof could impact our business and results of operations in the near term and over the next several years.

 
the budget proposal submitted to congress by president obama in february 2012 includes a provision that would reduce the base exclusivity period for a biologics product from 12 years to seven years. there was no corresponding pending bill designed to amend the u.s. healthcare legislation to alter the biologics provisions. the budget proposal was voted down 414-0 in the u.s. house of representatives. no vote has yet been held in the u.s. senate.


industry-specific challenges


the majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in our 2011 annual report on form 10-k, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we face a number of industry-specific challenges, which can significantly impact our results. these factors include, among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, pipeline productivity and the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition among branded products.


as more fully explained in our 2011 annual report on form 10-k, the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. our 2012 financial guidance reflects the anticipated impact in 2012 of the loss of such rights as described below (see the “our financial guidance for 2012” section of this md&a for additional information).


our 2012 results have been and/or will be adversely impacted by the following recent developments:






  


●


lipitor in the u.s.—lipitor lost exclusivity in the u.s. in november 2011. following the end of the 180-day generic exclusivity period in late may 2012, we expect the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s., with attendant increased competitive pressures. beginning in 2012, sales of lipitor in the u.s. are reported in our established products business unit.





lipitor in international markets––lipitor lost exclusivity in japan in 2011, australia in february 2012 and certain european markets in march 2012, and it will lose exclusivity in certain other european markets in may 2012.






  


●


other recent loss of exclusivity impacts––in the u.s., we lost exclusivity for vfend tablets in february 2011, for xalatan in march 2011, for caduet in november 2011 and for geodon in march 2012. the basic u.s. patent (including the six-month pediatric exclusivity period) for protonix expired in january 2011. the basic patent for vfend tablets in brazil expired in january 2011. we lost exclusivity for aromasin in the u.s. in april 2011 and in the majority of european markets and japan in july 2011. we lost exclusivity for xalatan and xalacom in the majority of european markets in january 2012. we lost exclusivity for aricept in many of the major european markets in february 2012.





in addition, we expect to lose exclusivity for the following other products in 2012:






  


●


revatio tablet in the u.s. in september 2012, which reflects the extension of the exclusivity period from march to september 2012 as the result of a pediatric extension; and









  


●


detrol ir in the u.s. in september 2012.



 


  


45





  


 
our 2012 results also have been and/or will be adversely impacted by the following impacts on alliance revenues:






  


●


aricept––our rights to aricept in japan will return to eisai co., ltd. in december 2012.









  


●


spiriva–– our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim (bi) for spiriva will expire on a country-by-country basis between 2012 and 2016, including the expiration in certain eu markets in 2012.





for additional information, including with regard to the expiration of the patents and of co-promotion and licensing rights for various products in the u.s., eu and japan in 2012 and subsequent years, see the “patents and intellectual property rights” section of our 2011 annual report on form 10-k and the “the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights” section of our 2011 financial report, which is filed as exhibit 13 to our 2011 annual report on form 10-k.


we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasing incidents of infringement whenever we deem appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues––selected revenues from biopharmaceutical products” section of this md&a. see part ii––other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation.


in august 2011, the federal budget control act of 2011 (the act) was enacted in the u.s. the act includes provisions to raise the u.s. treasury department’s borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling, and provisions to reduce the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion between 2012 and 2021. deficit-reduction targets include $900 billion of discretionary spending reductions associated with the department of health and human services and various agencies charged with national security, but those discretionary spending reductions do not include programs such as medicare and medicaid or direct changes to pharmaceutical pricing, rebates or discounts. the office of management and budget (omb) is responsible for identifying the remaining $1.5 trillion of deficit reductions, which will be divided evenly between defense and non-defense spending. under this omb review process, social security, medicaid, veteran benefits and certain other spending categories are excluded from consideration, but reductions in payments to medicare providers may be made, although any such reductions are prohibited by law from exceeding 2%. additionally, certain payments to medicare part d plans, such as low-income subsidy payments, are exempt from reduction. while we do not know the specific nature of the spending reductions under the act that will affect medicare, we do not expect that those reductions will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. however, any significant spending reductions affecting medicare, medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit-reduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.


the global economic environment
 
in addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment, which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the u.s. and europe, affecting the performance of products such as lipitor, celebrex and lyrica and in a number of emerging markets. we believe that patients, experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment, including high unemployment levels, and increases in co-pays, sometimes are switching to generics, delaying treatments, skipping doses or using less effective treatments to reduce their costs. challenging economic conditions in the u.s. also have increased the number of patients in the medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many states, to formulary restrictions limiting access to brand-name drugs, including ours. in addition, during the first quarter of 2012, we continued to experience pricing pressure as a result of the economic environment in europe and in a number of emerging markets, with government-mandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european and emerging market countries.
 
significant portions of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the u.k. pound, the japanese yen, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will increase, having a positive impact, and our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact, on net income. likewise, if the u.s. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact, and our overall expenses will decrease, having a positive impact on net income. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.

despite the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial condition, see the "financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.


these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a; in part ii, item 1a., “risk factors”, of this form 10-q; and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2011 annual report on form 10-k.


our strategy


we believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. we continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. we will work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to patients and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues.


on april 23, 2012, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our nutrition operating segment to nestlé. if the closing conditions are satisfied and the sale of the nutrition business is completed, and if a decision is made to separate animal health from the company, then, following these separations, pfizer will be a global biopharmaceutical company with an innovative core and a value core, with different cost structures and operating drivers, and a complementary consumer healthcare business with several well-known brands. the innovative core includes a portfolio of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line products and an r&d organization focused on continuing to build a robust pipeline of highly differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical needs. the value core includes a portfolio of products that have lost exclusivity or are approaching the loss of exclusivity that help meet the global need for less expensive, quality medicines.


in response to the challenging operating environment, we have taken and continue to take many steps to strengthen our company and better position ourselves for the future. we believe in a comprehensive approach to our challenges––organizing our business to maximize research, development and commercial opportunities, improving the performance of our innovative core and our value core, making the right capital allocation decisions, and protecting our intellectual property.


we continue to closely evaluate our global research and development function and pursue strategies to improve innovation and overall productivity by prioritizing areas with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, utilizing appropriate risk/return profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time. to that end, our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small and large molecules––immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines. in addition to reducing the number of disease areas of focus and the number of r&d programs, we are realigning and reducing our research and development footprint, and outsourcing certain functions that do not drive competitive advantage for pfizer. as a result of these actions, we expect significant reductions in our annual research and development expenses, which are reflected in our 2012 financial guidance, and we expect to incur significant costs in order to achieve these reductions, which are also reflected in our 2012 financial guidance. for additional information, see the “our financial guidance for 2012” and “costs and expenses—restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” sections of this md&a.


while a significant portion of r&d is done internally, we continue to seek to expand our pipeline by entering into agreements with other companies to develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. collaboration, alliance and license agreements and acquisitions allow us to capitalize on these compounds to expand our pipeline of potential future products. in addition, collaborations and alliances allow us to share risk and to access external scientific and technological expertise.


for information about our pending new drug applications (nda) and supplemental filings, see the “revenues—product developments-biopharmaceutical” section of this md&a.


our acquisition strategy included the acquisition of wyeth in 2009. we continue to build on our broad portfolio of businesses through various business development transactions. see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a for information on our recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe complement our businesses.

we continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies), and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access. in addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity.


we remain focused on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the company. for information regarding our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, see the “costs and expenses—restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a.


our strategy also includes directly enhancing shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources—share purchase plans and dividends on common stock” sections of this md&a for more information.


our business development initiatives


we are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate profitable revenue growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. we are especially interested in opportunities in our high-priority therapeutic areas––immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular; metabolic and endocrine diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines––and in emerging markets and established products. the most significant recent transactions are described below.

in early 2011, we announced that we were conducting a strategic review of all of our businesses and assets. on july 7, 2011, we announced our decisions to explore strategic alternatives for our animal health and nutrition businesses and noted that they may include, among other things, a full or partial separation of each of these businesses through a spin-off, sale, or other transaction. we indicated that these potential actions may create greater shareholder value, enable us to become a more focused organization and optimize capital allocation. given the separate and distinct nature of animal health and nutrition, we stated we may pursue a different strategic alternative for each of these businesses.





on april 23, 2012, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our nutrition operating segment to nestlé for $11.85 billion in cash. the transaction is expected to close by the first half of 2013, assuming the receipt of the required regulatory clearances and satisfaction of the other closing conditions.  as a result of our decision to divest this business, the nutrition business will be presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented on a retroactive basis beginning in the second quarter of 2012.  therefore, all revenues and expenses related to the nutrition business will be presented in a single line, discontinued operations––net of tax. additionally, the assets and liabilities associated with this business will be classified as assets of discontinued operations and other assets held for sale and liabilities of discontinued operations, as appropriate, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.


we expect to finalize a strategic decision for our animal health business in 2012 and to complete any separation of this business by july 2013.


we will continue to assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities for our businesses.

on march 12, 2012, biocon and pfizer announced the conclusion of their alliance to commercialize biocon’s biosimilar versions of insulin and insulin analog products. the companies agreed that due to the individual priorities for their respective biosimilars businesses, it is in their best interest to move forward independently.









  


●


on february 26, 2012, we completed our acquisition of alacer corp. (alacer), a privately owned company that manufactures, markets and distributes emergen-c, a line of effervescent, powdered drink mix vitamin supplements that is the largest-selling branded vitamin c line in the u.s. for additional information on our acquisition of alacer, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2a. acquisitions and divestitures: acquisitions. the allocation of the consideration transferred has not been finalized.

on december 1, 2011, we completed our acquisition of the consumer healthcare business of ferrosan holding a/s (ferrosan), a danish company engaged in the sale of science-based consumer healthcare products, including dietary supplements and lifestyle products, primarily in the nordic region and the emerging markets of russia and central and eastern europe. due to the fact that financial information included in our fiscal year 2011 consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the u.s. is as of and for the year ended november 30, this acquisition is reflected in our condensed consolidated financials in the first fiscal quarter of 2012. our acquisition of ferrosan’s consumer healthcare business increases our presence in dietary supplements with a new set of brands and pipeline products. also, we believe that the acquisition allows us to expand the marketing of ferrosan’s brands through pfizer’s global footprint and provide greater distribution and scale for certain pfizer brands, such as centrum and caltrate, in ferrosan’s key markets. for additional information on our acquisition of ferrosan, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2a. acquisitions and divestitures: acquisitions. the allocation of the consideration transferred has not been finalized.

our financial guidance for 2012


we forecast 2012 revenues of $58.0 billion to $60.0 billion, reported diluted earnings per common share (eps) of $1.23 to $1.38 and adjusted diluted eps of $2.14 to $2.24. we have updated our guidance for 2012 revenues, adjusted income and adjusted diluted eps to reflect our decision to sell the nutrition operating segment. we have updated our guidance for 2012 reported net income and reported diluted eps primarily to reflect additional expenses related to certain legal matters and certain asset impairment charges. the current exchange rates assumed in connection with the 2012 financial guidance are a blend of the actual exchange rates in effect during the first three months of 2012 and the mid-april 2012 exchange rates for the remainder of the year. for an understanding of adjusted income and adjusted diluted eps, see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.
 

a reconciliation of 2012 adjusted income and adjusted diluted eps guidance to 2012 reported net income attributable to pfizer inc. and reported diluted eps attributable to pfizer inc. common shareholders guidance follows:

(a)


includes revenues and expenses related to the nutrition business as a discontinued operation, but does not include any gain on the pending sale of the nutrition business. does not assume the completion of any business-development transactions not completed as of april 1, 2012, including any one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions. also excludes the potential effects of the resolution of litigation-related matters not substantially resolved as of april 30, 2012.



(b)


for an understanding of adjusted income and adjusted diluted eps, see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.



(c)


includes amounts related to our initiatives to reduce r&d spending, including our realigned r&d footprint, and amounts related to other cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. in the reconciliation between net income attributable to pfizer inc., as reported under principles generally accepted in the united states of america (u.s. gaap), and adjusted income, and in the reconciliation between diluted eps, as reported under u.s. gaap, and adjusted diluted eps, these amounts are categorized as certain significant items (see the “adjusted income––reconciliation” section of this md&a).


  

the changes in the amounts from the reconciliation relating to the 2012 financial guidance in the company’s 2011 annual report on form 10-k are primarily due to the reclassification of costs from acquisition-related costs to non-acquisition related restructuring costs.



(d)


income attributable to pfizer’s nutrition business.





for a description of our actual and anticipated costs and savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, see the “costs and expenses––restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a.


our 2012 financial guidance is subject to a number of factors and uncertainties—as described in the “our operating environment”, “our strategy” and “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” sections of this md&a; part ii, item 1a., “risk factors,” of this form 10-q; the “our operating environment” and “our strategy” sections of our 2011 financial report, which is filed as exhibit 13 to our 2011 annual report on form 10-k; and part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2011 annual report on form 10-k.

(a)


includes revenues generated primarily from pfizer centresource, our contract manufacturing and bulk pharmaceutical chemical sales organization.






biopharmaceutical revenues



worldwide revenues from biopharmaceutical products for the first quarter of 2012 were $13.1 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to:






  


●


the decrease of approximately $1.3 billion in operational revenues due to the loss of exclusivity of various products in certain markets, including a decrease of $991 million in operational revenues from lipitor;





partially offset by:






  


●


a lower reduction in revenues related to u.s. healthcare legislation of $43 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011; and









  


●


an increase in operational revenues for certain biopharmaceutical products, particularly lyrica, celebrex and enbrel.





geographically,






  


●


in the u.s., revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 17% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily reflecting lower revenues from lipitor, xalatan, caduet, effexor, geodon, zosyn, aromasin and vfend,  all due to loss of exclusivity, and lower revenues from prevnar 13. the impact of these adverse factors was partially offset by the strong performance of certain other biopharmaceutical products and the lower reduction in revenues related to u.s. healthcare legislation.









  


●


in our international markets, revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 1% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 1% in the first quarter of 2012. operationally, revenues were flat primarily impacted by declines in lipitor, xalatan/xalacom, norvasc, aromasin and effexor, all due to loss of exclusivity in certain markets, and lower alliance revenues, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of aricept in many major european markets as well as lower revenues for spiriva in certain european countries reflecting the final-year terms of our spiriva collaboration agreements relating to those countries.



 


  


50





  


 
during the first quarter of 2012, international revenues from biopharmaceutical products represented 60% of total revenues from biopharmaceutical products, compared to 56% in the first quarter of 2011.


primary care operating segment




●


primary care unit revenues decreased 25% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to lower operational revenues of 25%, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of lipitor in the u.s. in november 2011 and the resulting shift in the reporting of u.s. lipitor revenues to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2012.  u.s. branded lipitor revenues, reported by the established products business unit in the first quarter of 2012, decreased to $383 million, or 71%, from $1.3 billion compared to the same period in 2011. collectively, the decline in revenues for lipitor in the u.s. and for certain other primary care unit products that lost exclusivity in various markets in 2011, as well as the resulting shift in the reporting of such product revenues to the established products unit, reduced primary care unit revenues by $1.5 billion, or 28%, in comparison with the first quarter of 2011. the impact of these declines was partially offset by the strong growth of lyrica, most notably in japan, in addition to the solid performance of celebrex and premarin.



 
specialty care and oncology operating segment




●


specialty care unit revenues decreased 9% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to lower operational revenues of 9%. operational revenues were unfavorably impacted by lower prevnar 13/prevenar 13 revenues in the u.s. and developed europe primarily because most patients eligible to receive the pediatric catch-up dose have already been vaccinated. prevnar 13 u.s. revenues were also impacted by a lower birth cohort compared with the same quarter last year. additionally, specialty care unit revenues were unfavorably impacted by the losses of exclusivity of vfend and xalatan in the u.s. in february and march 2011, respectively, and the resulting shift in the reporting of vfend and xalatan u.s. revenues to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2012, as well as the loss of exclusivity of geodon in the u.s. in march 2012. collectively, these developments relating to vfend, xalatan, and geodon and the impact of other specialty care unit products that lost exclusivity in various markets in 2011 reduced specialty care unit revenues by $264 million, or 7%, in comparison with the first quarter of 2011. operational revenues were favorably impacted by the growth of enbrel, as well as the prevenar franchise in japan and australia.









●


oncology unit revenues decreased 7% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to lower operational revenues of 7%. operational revenues were unfavorably impacted by the loss of exclusivity of aromasin in the majority of european markets in the second half of 2011 and the resulting shift in the reporting of such revenues to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2012. this loss of exclusivity reduced oncology unit revenues by $61 million, or 20%, in comparison with the first quarter of 2011. operational revenues were favorably impacted by the growth of sutent, as well as the launches of inlyta and xalkori in the u.s.

established products unit revenues increased 18% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to higher operational revenues of 17% and a 1% favorable impact of foreign exchange. the increase in established products unit operational revenues in the first quarter of 2012 was mainly due to recent launches of generic versions of certain pfizer branded primary care and specialty care products, including $383 million of u.s. branded lipitor revenues and by our agreement granting watson pharmaceuticals, inc. the exclusive right to sell the authorized generic version of lipitor in the u.s. operational revenues were unfavorably impacted by the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s. for donepezil (aricept) in may 2011.









●


emerging markets unit revenues increased 6%, in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, due to higher operational revenues of 9%, partially offset by a 3% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the increase in emerging markets unit operational revenues in the first quarter of 2012 was due to continued volume growth across the product portfolio, primarily in china, russia and mexico, as a result of more focused, targeted promotional efforts for key products. these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of increased pricing pressures and changes in the timing of government purchases in turkey.





in the first quarter of 2012, total revenues from established products in both the established products and emerging markets units were $3.8 billion, with $965 million generated in emerging markets.

animal health and consumer healthcare operating segment




●


animal health unit revenues increased 4% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflecting higher operational revenues of 6% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2%. operational revenues from animal health products were favorably impacted compared to the same period in 2011 primarily by the full-quarter impact of legacy king product revenues in the first quarter of 2012 compared with the partial-quarter impact in the first quarter of 2011, as well as solid performances in both the global livestock and the companion animal portfolios.

●


consumer healthcare unit revenues decreased 1% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflecting lower operational revenues of 1%. the operational revenue decrease was primarily due to the impact of a less severe cold/flu season and the restocking of centrum in europe in the prior-year quarter after the temporary voluntary withdrawal of that product in europe in the third quarter of 2010.





nutrition operating segment




●


nutrition unit revenues increased 9% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflecting higher operational revenues of 8% and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 1%. the operational revenue increase was primarily due to benefits from continued successful new product launches, increased promotional activities and overall strength in key markets, most notably china. on april 23, 2012, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our nutrition operating segment to nestlé. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 14. subsequent event for more information.





rebates and chargebacks


as is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions, that generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized and primarily represent rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results generally have been less than 1% of biopharmaceutical product net sales and can result in either a net increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.

(a)


rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year are impacted by the mix of products sold.



(b)


performance-based contracts are with wholesalers/distributors, as well as with managed care customers, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance terms for specific products or sales milestones.



(c)


chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.





the total rebates and chargebacks for the first quarter of 2012 were lower than for the first quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of:






  


●


the impact of decreased medicare, medicaid and performance-based contract rebates contracted for lipitor and certain other products that have lost exclusivity;



 




  


●


changes in product mix; and



 





  


●


the impact on chargebacks of decreased sales for certain products that have lost exclusivity;



 

partially offset by, among other factors:






  


●


an increase in chargebacks for our branded products as a result of increasing competitive pressures and increasing sales for certain branded products and certain generic products sold by our greenstone unit that are subject to chargebacks.





our accruals for medicaid rebates, medicare rebates, performance-based contract rebates and chargebacks totaled $3.0 billion as of april 1, 2012, a decrease from $3.3 billion as of december 31, 2011, and primarily are all included in other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

lipitor, for the treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood, is the most widely used branded prescription treatment for lowering cholesterol. lipitor recorded worldwide revenues of $1.4 billion, or a decrease of 42%, in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to:

o


the impact of loss of exclusivity in canada in may 2010, spain in july 2010, brazil in august 2010, mexico in december 2010, japan in june 2011 (with generic entry occurring in november 2011) and the u.s. in november 2011;









  


o


the continuing impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition from generics and branded products worldwide; and



 





  


o



increased payer pressure worldwide, including the need for flexible rebate policies.







geographically,






  


o


in the u.s., lipitor revenues were $383 million, a decrease of 71% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011; and









  


o


in our international markets, lipitor revenues were $1.0 billion, a decrease of 6%, in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. foreign exchange had a favorable impact on international revenues of $2 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011.





see the “our operating environment” section of this md&a for a discussion concerning losses and expected losses of exclusivity for lipitor in various markets that have impacted or will impact our results in 2012.

lyrica, indicated for the management of post-herpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the management of fibromyalgia, and as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures in the u.s., and for neuropathic pain (peripheral and central), adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and general anxiety disorder in certain countries outside the u.s., recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 16% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. lyrica had a strong operational performance in international markets in the first quarter of 2012, including japan, where lyrica was launched in 2010 as the first product approved for the peripheral neuropathic pain (nep) indication. internationally, lyrica revenues increased 21% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 with the growth being attributed to a focus on enhancing the neuropathic pain diagnosis and treatment rates, the successful launches of the general anxiety disorder indications to pneumocystic carinii pneumonia and the promotion of the new phase iv data in post-traumatic nep.  in the u.s., revenues increased 9% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. notwithstanding this increase, u.s. revenues continue to be affected by increased competition from generic versions of competitive medicines, as well as managed care pricing and formulary pressures.

prevnar 13/prevenar 13 is our 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the prevention of various syndromes of pneumococcal disease in infants and young children and in adults 50 years of age and older. prevnar 13/prevenar 13 for use in infants and young children has been launched in the u.s. for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 13 serotypes in prevnar 13 and otitis media caused by the seven serotypes in prevnar, and in the eu and many other international markets for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by the vaccine serotypes. worldwide revenues for prevnar 13/prevenar 13 decreased 6% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to lower revenues in the u.s. and developed europe due to a decline in the number of patients eligible to receive the pediatric catch-up dose and a lower birth cohort in the u.s. in 2011, we received approval of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 for use in adults 50 years of age and older in the u.s. for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 13 serotypes in prevnar 13, and in the eu for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the vaccine serotypes. to date, prevenar 13 for use in adults 50 years of age and older has been approved in over 40 countries and has been launched in the u.s., 12 developed europe markets and 14 emerging market countries.





we currently are conducting the community-acquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults (capita) to fulfill requirements in connection with the fda’s approval of the prevnar 13 adult indication under its accelerated approval program. capita is an efficacy trial involving subjects 65 years of age and older that is designed to evaluate whether prevnar 13 is effective in preventing the first episode of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes contained in the vaccine. we estimate that this event-driven trial will be completed in 2013. at its regular meeting held on february 22, 2012, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) indicated that it will defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older until the results of capita, as well as data on the impact of pediatric use of prevnar 13 on the disease burden and serotype distribution among adults, are available. we expect that the rate of uptake for the use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older will be impacted by acip’s decision to defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in that population.

enbrel, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis affecting the spine, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues, excluding the u.s. and canada, of 3% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. enbrel revenues from the u.s. and canada are included in alliance revenues.

under our co-promotion agreement with amgen inc. (amgen), we co-promote enbrel in the u.s. and canada and share in the profits from enbrel sales in those countries, which we include in alliance revenues. our co-promotion agreement with amgen will expire in october 2013, and, subject to the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to a royalty stream for 36 months thereafter, which we expect will be significantly less than our current share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canadian sales. following the end of the royalty period, we will not be entitled to any further revenues from enbrel sales in the u.s. and canada. our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the u.s. and canada will not be affected by the expiration of the co-promotion agreement with amgen.






●


celebrex, indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis worldwide and for the management of acute pain in adults in the u.s., japan and certain markets in the eu, recorded increases in worldwide revenues of 7% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. in the u.s., volume continues to be challenged by increased competition from generic versions of competitive medicines and managed care formulary pressures. celebrex is supported by continued educational and promotional efforts highlighting its efficacy and safety profile for appropriate patients.









●


viagra remains the leading treatment for erectile dysfunction. viagra worldwide revenues increased 6% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011.









●


norvasc, for treating hypertension, lost exclusivity in the u.s. and other major markets in 2007 and in canada in 2009. norvasc worldwide revenues decreased 6% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011.









●


zyvox is the world’s best-selling agent among those used to treat serious gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus-aureus. zyvox worldwide revenues increased 2% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to growth in emerging markets.









●


sutent is for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors after disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. sutent worldwide revenues increased 9% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to strong operational performance driven by increased market share in the u.s. and emerging markets, as well as approval of sutent to treat progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, a rare disease, in the u.s. in may 2011 and in the eu in late 2010. we continue to drive total revenue and prescription growth, supported by cost-effectiveness data and efficacy data in first-line mrcc––including two-year survival data, which represent the first time that overall survival of two years has been seen in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, as well as through increasing access and healthcare coverage. as of march 31, 2012, sutent was the most prescribed oral mrcc therapy in the u.s.









●



our premarin family of products remains the leading therapy to help women address moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms. it recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 11% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011 primarily attributed to increased market share for premarin vc, favorable wholesaler inventory levels and a price increase in january 2012, partially offset by unfavorable rebates.










●


xalabrands consists of xalatan, a prostaglandin, which is a branded agent used to reduce elevated eye pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and xalacom, a fixed combination prostaglandin (xalatan) and beta blocker (timolol) available outside the u.s. xalatan/xalacom worldwide revenues decreased 42% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. lower revenues were due to the loss of exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2011 and in the majority of european markets in january 2012.









●


detrol/detrol la, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, is one of the most prescribed branded medicines worldwide for overactive bladder. detrol la is an extended-release formulation taken once a day. detrol/detrol la worldwide revenues declined 13% the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to increased competition from other branded medicines and a shift in promotional focus to our toviaz product in most major markets. detrol immediate release (detrol ir) will lose exclusivity in the u.s. in september 2012.









●


genotropin, one of the world’s leading human growth hormones, is used in children for the treatment of short stature with growth hormone deficiency, prader-willi syndrome, turner syndrome, small for gestational age syndrome, idiopathic short stature (in the u.s. only) and chronic renal insufficiency (outside the u.s. only), as well as in adults with growth hormone deficiency. genotropin is supported by a broad platform of innovative injection-delivery devices and patient-support programs. genotropin worldwide revenues decreased 7% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011.









●


benefix and refacto af/xyntha are hemophilia products using state-of-the-art manufacturing that assist patients with a lifelong bleeding disorder. benefix is the only available recombinant factor ix product for the treatment of hemophilia b, while refacto af/xyntha are recombinant factor viii products for the treatment of hemophilia a. both products are indicated for the control and prevention of bleeding in patients with these disorders and in some countries also are indicated for prophylaxis in certain situations, such as surgery. benefix recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 12% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to price increases and strong demand due to adherence programs in the u.s. and strong new patient uptake in japan. refacto af/xyntha recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 13% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to growth in emerging markets.

●


geodon/zeldox, an atypical antipsychotic, is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar manic or mixed episodes, and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. geodon worldwide revenues decreased 22% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to loss of exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2012.









●


vfend is a broad-spectrum agent for treating yeast and molds. vfend worldwide revenues decreased 9% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. while international revenues of vfend continued to be driven by its acceptance as an excellent broad-spectrum agent for treating serious yeast and molds, revenues in the u.s. declined primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of vfend tablets and the launch of generic voriconazole (generic vfend) in february 2011.









●


chantix/champix is an aid to smoking-cessation treatment in adults 18 years of age and older. chantix/champix worldwide revenues decreased 11% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. revenues in the first quarter of 2012 primarily decreased due to the impact of changes to the product’s label and other factors. we are continuing our educational and promotional efforts, which are focused on addressing the significant health consequences of smoking highlighting the chantix/champix benefit-risk proposition and emphasizing the importance of the physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit smoking.









●


pristiq is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the u.s. and in various other countries. pristiq has also been approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (vms) associated with menopause in thailand, mexico, the philippines and ecuador. pristiq recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 17% in first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily driven by a new, more focused targeted strategy and promotional activities in the u.s., and internationally by both launches in new markets and further penetration in existing markets.









●


prevnar/prevenar (7-valent), our 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for preventing invasive, and, in certain international markets, non-invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children, recorded a decrease in worldwide revenues of 10% in first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. many markets have transitioned from the use of prevnar/prevenar (7-valent) to prevnar 13/prevenar 13, resulting in lower revenues for prevnar/prevenar (7-valent). we expect this trend to continue.









●


revatio, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah), had an increase in worldwide revenues of 11% in first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due in part to increased pah awareness driving earlier diagnosis in the u.s. and eu. in the u.s., revatio tablet will lose exclusivity in september 2012, and revatio iv injection will lose exclusivity in may 2013.









●


effexor, an antidepressant for treating adult patients with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder, recorded a decrease in worldwide revenues of 37% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. effexor and effexor xr, an extended-release formulation, face generic competition in most markets, including in the u.s., where effexor xr lost exclusivity on july 1, 2010. this generic competition had a negative impact in the first quarter of 2012 and 2011, and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our revenues for effexor and effexor xr.









●


zosyn/tazocin, our broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic, faces generic global competition. u.s. exclusivity was lost in september 2009. zosyn/tazocin recorded a decrease in worldwide revenues of 28% in first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011.









●


caduet is a single-pill therapy combining lipitor and norvasc for the prevention of cardiovascular events. caduet worldwide revenues decreased 54% in first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to the loss of u.s. exclusivity in november 2011.









●


xalkori, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk)-positive as detected by an fda-approved test, was approved by the fda in august 2011. xalkori has been approved in several other markets, including south korea, switzerland, mexico, israel, japan and canada for the treatment of alk-positive advanced nsclc.









●


inlyta was approved by the fda in january 2012 and by the swiss health authority in april 2012 for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of a prior systemic treatment.









●


alliance revenues worldwide decreased 5% in first quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity for aricept 5mg and 10mg tablets in the u.s. in november 2010 and the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s. in may 2011, partially offset by the strong performance of spiriva and enbrel in the u.s. and canada. we expect that the aricept 23mg tablet will have exclusivity in the u.s. until july 2013. see the “industry-specific challenges” section of this md&a for a discussion regarding the expiration of various contract rights relating to spiriva and aricept in 2012. eliquis (apixaban) is being jointly developed and commercialized by pfizer and bristol-myers squibb (bms). the two companies share with respect to the approved indication in the eu and, if and when indications for eliquis are approved in various markets, will share on a global basis commercialization expenses and profit/losses equally.

research and development operations


innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable, particularly for human health products. as a result, and also because we are predominately a human health company, the vast majority of our r&d spending is associated with human health products, compounds and activities.


we incurred the following expenses in connection with our research and development (r&d) operations (see also notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 13. segment, geographic and other revenue information):

(a)


our operating segments, in addition to their sales and marketing responsibilities, are responsible for certain development activities. generally, these responsibilities relate to additional indications for in-line products and ipr&d projects that have achieved proof-of-concept. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights.







(b)


worldwide research and development is generally responsible for human health research projects until proof-of-concept is achieved, and then for transitioning those projects to the appropriate business unit for possible clinical and commercial development. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. this organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects. worldwide research and development is also responsible for all human-health-related regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities. pfizer medical is responsible for external affairs relating to all therapeutic areas, providing pfizer-related medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, and quality assurance and regulatory compliance activities, which include conducting clinical trial audits and readiness reviews. the decrease in 2012 results from cost savings associated with the r&d productivity initiative announced on february 1, 2011 (see the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a).







(c)


corporate and other includes unallocated costs, primarily facility costs, information technology, share-based compensation, and restructuring-related costs. the increase in 2012 results primarily from additional depreciation – asset restructuring associated with the r&d productivity initiative announced on february 1, 2011 (see the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a).





product developments—biopharmaceutical
 
we continue to invest in r&d to provide potential future sources of revenues through the development of new products, as well as through additional uses for in-line and alliance products. notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for existing products or any of our other products in development.


we continue to closely evaluate our global research and development function and pursue strategies to improve innovation and overall productivity by prioritizing areas with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, utilizing appropriate risk/return profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time. to that end, our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small and large molecules –– immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines.

our collaboration with janssen ai on bapineuzumab, a potential treatment for mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease, continues with four phase 3, double-blind studies.  janssen ai is leading the two, primarily north american phase 3 studies (301 and 302). study 302 has completed, but the results remain blinded. janssen ai expects that study 301 will complete in the coming months. we are conducting the two, primarily international phase 3 studies (3000 and 3001). we expect that the last patient will have completed our two, primarily international 18-month trials, including associated biomarker studies, in 2014.





(b)


following requests by the fda in 2010, we suspended and subsequently terminated worldwide the osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy studies of tanezumab. the fda’s requests followed a small number of reports of osteoarthritis patients treated with tanezumab who experienced the worsening of osteoarthritis leading to total joint replacement and also reflected the fda’s concerns regarding the potential for such events in other patient populations. in december 2010, the fda placed a clinical hold on all other anti-nerve growth factor therapies under clinical investigation in the u.s. studies of tanezumab in cancer pain were allowed to continue. extensive analyses were undertaken of all total joint replacements reported in studies of tanezumab. the results of these analyses and the conclusions drawn were provided to the fda. on march 12, 2012, the fda arthritis advisory committee met to discuss the future development of nerve growth factor inhibitors, including tanezumab. the committee voted that there is a role for the ongoing development of nerve growth factor inhibitors in conditions such as osteoarthritis and for the management of pain associated with conditions other than osteoarthritis for which there are no agents with demonstrated analgesic effect. the committee’s recommendations are not binding on the fda, which will make the final determination on the partial clinical hold. discussions with fda are ongoing in an effort to resume clinical development of tanezumab.

(13

we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring businesses and restructuring and integrating acquired businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. for example:






  


●


for our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems; and









  


●


for our acquisition activity, we typically incur costs that can include transaction costs, integration costs (such as expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes) and restructuring charges, related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company.





all of our businesses and functions can be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development, as well as functions such as information technology, shared services and corporate operations.


since the acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009, our cost-reduction initiatives announced on january 26, 2009, but not completed as of december 31, 2009, were incorporated into a comprehensive plan to integrate wyeth’s operations to generate cost savings and to capture synergies across the combined company. in addition, on february 1, 2011, we announced a new research and productivity initiative to accelerate our strategies to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d by prioritizing areas with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, utilizing appropriate risk/return profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time.

cost-reduction goals


with respect to the january 26, 2009 announcements, and our acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009, in the aggregate, we set a goal to generate cost reductions, net of investments in the business, of approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, by the end of 2012, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, in comparison with the 2008 pro forma combined adjusted total costs of the legacy pfizer and legacy wyeth operations. (for an understanding of adjusted total costs, see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.) we achieved this goal by the end of 2011, a year earlier than expected.


with respect to the new r&d productivity initiative announced on february 1, 2011, we set a goal to achieve significant reductions in our annual research and development expenses by the end of 2012. adjusted r&d expenses were $8.4 billion in 2011, and were $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2012. we expect adjusted r&d expenses to be approximately $6.5 billion to $7.0 billion in 2012. (for an understanding of adjusted research and development expenses, see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.) we are on track to meet this 2012 goal.


in addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our organizations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities.


expected total costs


we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in connection with these announced actions. we estimate that the total costs of both of the aforementioned initiatives could range up to $16.4 billion through 2012, of which we have incurred approximately $13.6 billion in cost-reduction and acquisition-related costs (excluding transaction costs) through april 1, 2012.


key activities


the targeted cost reductions have been and are being achieved through the following actions:






●


the closing of duplicative facilities and other site rationalization actions company-wide, including research and development facilities, manufacturing plants, sales offices and other corporate facilities.  among the more significant actions are the following:









  


●


manufacturing: after the acquisition of wyeth, our manufacturing sites totaled 81. other acquisitions have added 20 manufacturing sites and we have subsequently exited 9. our plant network strategy will result in the exit of a further 10 sites over the next several years.









  


●


research and development: after the acquisition of wyeth, we operated in 20 r&d sites and announced that we would close a number of sites. we have completed a number of site closures, including our sandwich, u.k. research and development facility, except for a small presence. in addition, in 2011, we rationalized several other sites to reduce and optimize the overall r&d footprint. we disposed of our toxicology site in catania, italy; exited our r&d sites in aberdeen and gosport, u.k.; and disposed of a vacant site in st. louis, mo. we are presently marketing for sale, lease or sale/lease-back, either a portion of or all of certain of our r&d campuses. locations with r&d operations are in the u.s., europe, canada and china, with five major research sites in addition to a number of specialized units. we also re-prioritized our commitments to disease areas and have discontinued certain therapeutic areas and r&d programs.



 




●


workforce reductions across all areas of our business and other organizational changes, primarily in the u.s. field manufacturing, r&d and corporate functions. we identified areas for a reduction in workforce across all of our businesses. after the closing of the wyeth acquisition, the combined workforce was approximately 120,700. as of april 1, 2012, after giving effect to the impact of acquisitions subsequent to the wyeth acquisition, the workforce totaled approximately 102,500, a decrease of 1,200, primarily in the u.s. field force, manufacturing, r&d and corporate operations, from 103,700 as of december 31, 2011. we have exceeded our original target for reducing the combined pfizer/wyeth workforce.









●


the increased use of shared services.









●


procurement savings.

adjusted income


general description of adjusted income measure


adjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines for humans and animals, consumer healthcare (over-the-counter) products, vaccines and nutrition products––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income. adjusted total costs represent the total of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted si&a expenses and adjusted r&d expenses, which are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and are components of, the overall adjusted income measure.


the adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted income measure is utilized:






●


senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income basis;









●


our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis; and









●


senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted income measure. adjusted income is one of the performance metrics utilized in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are funded from a pool based on the achievement of three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from adjusted income. since 2011, this metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool made available to elt members and other members of senior management and will constitute a factor in determining each of these individual’s bonus.





despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.


we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, the earn-out of performance share award grants is determined based on a formula that measures our performance using relative total shareholder return.


purchase accounting adjustments


adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets acquired from pharmacia, wyeth and king, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges.
 


  


65





  


 
certain of the purchase accounting adjustments associated with a business combination, such as the amortization of intangibles acquired as part of our acquisition of king in 2011, wyeth in 2009 and pharmacia in 2003, can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research and development costs previously have been expensed.


however, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.


acquisition-related costs


adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.


we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.


the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory authorities.


discontinued operations


adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the sale of such operations such as the sale of our capsugel business, which we sold in august 2011. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. (restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation of the restated periods but are presented here on a restated basis for consistency across all periods.)
 


  


66





  


 
certain significant items


adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; charges related to certain sales or disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transition service agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets


many changes in our asset and liability accounts as of april 1, 2012, compared to december 31, 2011, reflect, among other things, increases associated with our acquisitions of alacer corp. and ferrosan holding a/s (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements— note 2a. acquisitions and divestitures: acquisitions).


for information about certain of our financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments, short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt, see “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” below.


for accounts receivable, net, see “selected measures of liquidity and capital resources: accounts receivable” below.


for identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, the change also includes the impact of impairments of certain assets (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 4. other deductions—net).


for accounts payable, the change also reflects lower spending as a result of our cost reduction and productivity initiatives.

for pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations, the change also reflects the impact of $391 million of company contributions (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 10. pension and postretirement benefit plans).


for other noncurrent liabilities, the change also reflects a decrease in the fair value of derivative financial instruments in a liability position (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements – note 7a. financial instruments: selected financial assets and liabilities).

the working capital requirements of our operations, including our research and development activities;









  


●


investments in our business;









  


●


dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;









  


●


share repurchases, including our plan to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common stock in 2012;









  


●


the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;



 




  


●


paying down outstanding debt;









  


●


contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and









  


●


business-development activities.





our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service. see the “credit ratings” section below. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities.

net financial liabilities increased during the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower short-term investment and cash and cash equivalent balances, and higher short-term borrowing balances. for additional information, see the “analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows” section of this md&a.


credit ratings


two major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s investors service (moody’s) and standard & poor’s (s&p), assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

debt capacity


we have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of april 1, 2012, we had access to $9.0 billion of lines of credit, of which $1.9 billion expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.2 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.0 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of our unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2016, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings.


global economic conditions


the challenging economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future.

domestic and international short-term funds


many of our operations are conducted outside the u.s., and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. we generally hold approximately 10%-30% of these short-term funds in u.s. tax jurisdictions. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s. federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be permanently reinvested outside of the u.s., no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided.
 

assuming the receipt of the required regulatory clearances, the satisfaction of the other closing conditions and the completion of the sale of our nutrition operating segment to nestlé, a substantial portion of the sale proceeds will be located outside the u.s. we are evaluating and will continue to evaluate potential domestic and international uses of those proceeds in the context of our overall capital requirements and capital-allocation strategies. (for additional information regarding our agreement to sell the nutrition operating segment to nestlé, see the "our business development initiatives" section of this md&a.)

 
accounts receivable


we continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets, where economic conditions remain uncertain. historically, payments from a number of european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale and the trend is worsening. in greece, certain of our accounts receivable have been restructured into bonds with maturities that further lengthened the repayment timeline.


we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on an analysis of the following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistency of payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).


as of april 1, 2012, we had about $1.7 billion in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in spain, italy, greece, portugal and ireland, where economic conditions remain uncertain. such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date were as follows: $331 million in spain; $171 million in italy; $72 million in greece; and $19 million in portugal.


although certain european governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to appropriately balance repayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.


we will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts and/or write-down our holdings in greek bonds.


our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1c. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions included in our 2011 financial report, which is filed as exhibit 13 to our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2011.


share purchase plans


from june 2005 through april 1, 2012, we purchased approximately 1.3 billion shares of our common stock for approximately $29.6 billion. on february 1, 2011, we announced that the board of directors authorized a new $5 billion share-purchase plan. on december 12, 2011, we announced that the board of directors authorized an additional $10 billion share-purchase plan. in the first quarter of 2012, we purchased approximately 77 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.7 billion. we purchased approximately 73.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2011.


after giving effect to share purchases through april 1, 2012, our remaining share-purchase authorization is approximately $8.4 billion at april 1, 2012. during 2012, we anticipate purchasing approximately $5 billion of our common stock, with the remaining authorized amount available in 2013 and beyond.


off-balance sheet arrangements


in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of april 1, 2012, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.

certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.


dividends on common stock


in april 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.22 per share, payable june 5, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on may 11, 2012.

forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results


the sec encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. this report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future operating and financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic review, capital allocation, and share-repurchase and dividend-rate plans. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, share-repurchase and dividend-rate plans, government regulation and financial results, including, in particular, the financial guidance and anticipated costs and cost savings set forth in the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives”  and “our financial guidance for 2012” sections of this md&a. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results are the following:

we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.
 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports and our other filings with the sec.


our 2011 annual report on form 10-k listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results. we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that form 10-k in this filing and investors should refer to it. reference is also made to part ii, item 1a, “risk factors,” of this form 10-q. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.
 
this report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body of data. in addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.


legal proceedings and contingencies
 
information with respect to legal proceedings and contingencies required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12. commitments and contingencies in part i, item 1, of this form 10-q.
