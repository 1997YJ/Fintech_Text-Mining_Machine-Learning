“estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of our form 10-k, and as may be updated in our forms 10-q. our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of april 29, 2013.overviewour results of operations for each period were as follows: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) q1 2013 q4 2012 change q1 2013 q1 2012 changenet revenue $12,580 $13,477 $(897) $12,580 $12,906 $(326)gross

average seasonal decline in q1 and in line with our expectations that we provided in january. we saw a reduction of inventory levels in the traditional pc supply chain as oems reduced inventory on older-generation products. in addition, our inventories decreased by approximately $400 million during q1 2013. for q2 2013, we are forecasting a 3% increase in revenue from q1 2013, which is slightly above normal seasonal trends. the q2 2013 revenue forecast reflects expected inventory replenishment within the pc supply chain due to the expected launch of our next-generation microarchitecture platforms, code-named haswell, in q2 2013. we qualified for sale our first platforms on our next-generation microarchitecture late in q1 2013 and we expect to qualify addition platforms in q2 2013.30intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)our gross margin percentage in q1 2013 declined from q4 2012 as higher factory start-up costs and lower platform volume were partially offset by lower excess capacity charges and lower platform inventory write-offs. lower than expected factory loadings on older-generation process technologies in q1 2013 allowed us to reuse and redirect equipment and space from older technologies to our future process technologies, including 14nm. these actions have allowed us to reduce our forecasted capital expenditures in 2013 by $1.0 billion. q2 2013 gross margin percentage is expected to be approximately two percentage points higher when compared to q1 2013 as additional platform variations of our next-generation microarchitecture are expected to qualify for sale, resulting in lower platform inventory write-offs as well as sales of previously written-off inventory. in addition, we expect lower excess capacity charges in q2 2013 to be offset by higher start-up costs. the strength of our product portfolio is expected to increase as we launch new platforms designed for use in the data center and across devices that compute and connect to the internet. in q2 2013, we expect to ship new platforms which we anticipate will enable a new wave of ultra-sleek designs across multiple form factors including devices in the traditional pc, convertible, detachable, tablet, and smartphone market segments. these additions to our product portfolio include new platforms designed for use in smartphones and tablets, code-named clover trail+, and our next-generation microarchitecture platforms, code-named haswell, designed for use across traditional pcs, convertibles, and detachables. in the second half of 2013, we expect to launch our next-generation intel® atom™ microarchitecture platforms designed for use in a variety of ultra-mobile form factors including ultrabook™ systems, convertibles, and tablets, code-named bay trail, and smartphones, code-named merrifield. in the data center market segment, we expect that our next-generation intel atom microarchitecture platforms designed for use in the microserver market segment, code-named avoton, as well as our intel® xeon® processors manufactured using our 22nm process technology will both be shipping in the second half of 2013.we continue to extend our process technology leadership as we expect to begin manufacturing platforms using our next-generation 14nm process technology in the second half of 2013. in q1 2013, we shipped our first silicon to a foundry customer on our 22nm process technology and we announced an agreement with altera corporation in which they will manufacture their future next-generation products on our 14nm process technology. our business continues to produce significant cash from operations, generating $4.3 billion in q1 2013. from a financial condition perspective, we ended q1 2013 with an investment portfolio of $17.1 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. during q1 2013, we purchased $2.2 billion in capital assets, and returned cash to shareholders by both paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $533 million of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. in march 2013, the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.225 per common share to be paid in june 2013.our business outlook for q2 2013 and full-year 2013 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (r&d plus mg&a), and capital expenditures. we will keep our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference into this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10-q. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the

pc client group (pccg) and data center group (dcg) platform volume which decreased 6% primarily on softness in traditional pc demand. the decrease was partially offset by pccg and dcg platform average selling prices, which were up 3%. our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2013 decreased $1.2 billion, or 15%, compared to q1 2012. the decrease was primarily due to approximately $410 million of higher start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology and approximately $225 million of higher excess capacity charges. additionally, lower pccg and dcg platform revenue and higher pccg and dcg unit costs contributed to the decrease. our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 56.2% in q1 2013 from 64.0% in q1 2012. the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in pccg. we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q1 2013 and q1 2012 from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg operating segments.pc client groupthe revenue and operating income for the pccg operating segment for each period were as follows: (in millions) q1 2013 q1 2012net revenue $7,992 $8,499operating income $2,513 $3,491net revenue for the pccg operating segment decreased by $507 million, or 6%, in q1 2013 compared to q1 2012. pccg platform unit sales were down 7%, while platform average selling prices were up 1%. the decrease in revenue was driven by lower desktop and notebook platform unit sales which were down 7% and 6%, respectively. these decreases were partially offset by desktop platform average selling prices which were up 5%.operating income decreased by $978 million in q1 2013 compared to q1 2012 which was driven entirely by lower gross margin, as operating expenses were flat. the primary driver of the decrease in gross margin was approximately $375 million of higher start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology. lower platform revenue and approximately $170 million of higher excess capacity charges also contributed to the decrease.32intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

income $1,079 $1,135net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by $180 million, or 7%, in q1 2013 compared to q1 2012. the increase in revenue was due to 6% higher platform unit sales and 2% higher platform average selling prices. our platform unit sales continued to benefit from significant growth in the internet cloud and high performance computing market segments. operating income decreased by $56 million, or 5%, in q1 2013 compared to q1 2012 driven by $39 million of lower gross margin and $17 million of higher operating expenses. gross margin was negatively impacted by higher platform unit cost and approximately $45 million of excess capacity charges. these decreases were offset by higher platform revenue.other intel architecture operating segmentsthe revenue and operating

segments decreased by $97 million, or 9%, in q1 2013 compared to q1 2012. the decrease was primarily due to lower netbook platform volume.operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by $299 million from an operating loss of $312 million in q1 2012 to an operating loss of $611 million in q1 2013. the decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses in the other ia operating segments and lower netbook platform revenue.software and services operating segmentsthe revenue and operating income for the software and services operating

and development credit was recognized in q1 2013, positively impacting our effective tax rate. the substantial majority of the decrease between the q1 2013 and q1 2012 effective tax rate was driven by

in assets and liabilities as of march 30, 2013 compared to december 29, 2012 included the following:•accrued compensation and benefits decreased due to the payout of 2012 profit-dependent compensation.•inventories decreased due to a reduction in older-generation products.•accounts receivable decreased due to lower revenue in the first three months of 2013.in the first three months of 2013, our three largest customers accounted for 38% of net revenue (41% in the first three months of 2012) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 15% of our net revenue (18% in the first three months of 2012), dell inc. accounting for 14% of our net revenue (14% in the first three months of 2012), and lenovo group limited accounting for 9% of our net revenue (9% in the first three months of

the first three months of 2013, compared to the first three months of 2012, was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in the first three months of 2013, as compared to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in the first three months of 2012, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures.financing activitiesthe increase in cash used for financing activities in the first three months of 2013, compared to the first three months of 2012, was due to lower repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program and a decrease in short-term debt in the first three months of 2013, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans.35intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of march 30, 2013, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $17.1 billion ($18.2 billion as of december 29, 2012). in addition to the $17.1 billion, we have $2.3 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first three months of 2013. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of march 30, 2013. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 2: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of march 30, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $16.5 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $6.3 billion was classified as level 1, $9.9 billion as level 2, and $222 million as level 3.our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $9.9 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 65% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 35% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when observable market data is not available, we corroborate our fair value measurements using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes from a second source.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of march 30, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $764 million of loans receivable and $1.2 billion of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.36intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)marketable equity securitiesas of march 30, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $4.7 billion of marketable equity securities. all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.37
