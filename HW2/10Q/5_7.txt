item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.certain revenue information in the section entitled "—three and six months ended june 30, 2016 and 2015—revenue—foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.executive overview of second quarter resultsour key user metrics and financial results for the second quarter of 2016 are as follows:user growth:•daily active users (daus) were 1.13 billion on average for june 2016, an increase of 17% year-over-year.•mobile daus were 1.03 billion on average for june 2016, an increase of 22% year-over-year.•monthly active users (maus) were 1.71 billion as of june 30, 2016, an increase of 15% year-over-year.•mobile maus were 1.57 billion as of june 30, 2016, an increase of 20% year-over-year.financial results:•revenue was $6.44 billion, up 59% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $6.24 billion, up 63% year-over-year.•total costs and expenses were $3.69 billion.•income from operations was $2.75 billion.•net income was $2.06 billion with diluted earnings per share of $0.71.•capital expenditures were $995 million.•effective tax rate was 26%.•cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $23.29 billion as of june 30, 2016.•headcount was 14,495 as of june 30, 2016.in the second quarter of 2016, we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through expanded capabilities of tools for marketers.we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the facebook app and platform, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as messenger, instagram, whatsapp and video, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives that we believe will further our mission to connect the world, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2015.21trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), mobile daus, maus, mobile maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated. trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 22worldwide daus increased 17% to 1.13 billion on average during june 2016 from 968 million during june 2015. we experienced growth in daus across major markets, including india, brazil, and the united states. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in june 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline.•mobile daus. we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger mobile application (and is also a registered facebook user) on a given day. we define a mobile-only dau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day, whereas a mobile dau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer on that day. worldwide mobile daus increased 22% to 1.03 billion on average during june 2016 from 844 million during june 2015. in all regions, an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during june 2016, as compared to the same period during 2015, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during june 2016. on average during june 2016, there were 885 million mobile-only daus, increasing 29% from 688 million mobile-only daus during the same period in 2015. the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.23•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.as of june 30, 2016, we had 1.71 billion maus, an increase of 15% from june 30, 2015. users in india, indonesia, and the united states represented key sources of growth in the second quarter of 2016, relative to the same period in 2015. overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in june 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline.24•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger mobile application (and is also a registered facebook user) during the period of measurement. we define a mobile-only mau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement, whereas a mobile mau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement.worldwide mobile maus increased 20% to 1.57 billion as of june 30, 2016 from 1.31 billion as of june 30, 2015. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, with users in india, the united states, and brazil representing key sources of mobile mau growth in the second quarter of 2016. there were 967 million mobile-only maus as of june 30, 2016, increasing 48% from 655 million mobile-only maus during the same period in 2015. the remaining 607 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during june 2016. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.25trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in the second quarter of 2016 in the united states & canada region was more than eight times higher than in the asia-pacific region.note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography in late 2015. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide revenue, it did affect our attribution of revenue to different geographic regions. the fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and arpu amounts for all regions were adjusted to reflect this reclassification.26during the second quarter of 2016, worldwide arpu was $3.82, an increase of 38% from the second quarter of 2015. over this period, arpu increased by 54% in united states & canada, 40% in europe, 37% in asia-pacific, and 26% in rest of world. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.27components of results of operationsrevenueadvertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties, such as our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.payments and other fees. we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales, and our ad serving and measurement products. cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, energy and bandwidth costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include professional and legal services. general and administrative expenses also include depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets we have acquired.28results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data: three months ended june

first six months of 2016 increased $2.39 billion, or 59%, and $4.23 billion, or 56%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. the increases were primarily due to increases in advertising revenue.the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices. for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 84% and 83%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 76% and 74%, respectively in the same periods in 2015. factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) an increase in mobile user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. however, we anticipate increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed will be a less significant driver of our revenue growth in the future.in addition, during the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, the average price per ad increased by 9% and 7%, respectively, and the number of ads delivered increased by 49% and 50%, respectively. the 30increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed, while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth.payments and other fees revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 decreased $18 million, or 8%, and $64 million, or 14%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. the decreases in payments and other fees revenue were primarily due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers. facebook usage on personal computers has been declining and will continue to decline in the future, resulting in a continuing decline in our payments revenue. we anticipate the decline in our payments revenue will be offset, in part or in whole, by the revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales.foreign exchange impact on revenuethe foreign exchange impact on our revenue and advertising revenue from the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2016 was not material.the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the six months ended june 30, 2016 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue would have been $12.02 billion, and our advertising revenue would have been $11.64 billion. using these constant rates, both revenue and advertising revenue would have been $203 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the first six months of 2016.cost of revenue three months ended june 30,   six months ended june 30,   2016 2015 % change 2016 2015 % change (in

periods were due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 34% growth in employee headcount from june 30, 2015 to june 30, 2016 in engineering and other technical functions. additionally, in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, our equipment and related expenses to support our research and development efforts increased $34 million and $71 million, respectively, and our changes to the fair value of our contingent liability increased $31 million and $45 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.31marketing and

2016 in our marketing and sales functions. additionally, in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, our marketing expenses increased $91 million and $137 million, respectively, and our professional services expenses increased $62 million and $104 million respectively, due to higher consulting and other professional service fees, compared to the same periods in 2015.general and

income/(expense), net as a result of higher invested cash balances and interest rates, which for the second quarter of 2016, was partially offset by a decrease in other income/(expense), net. in the first six months of 2016, the increase in other income/(expense), net also contributed to the increase in interest and other income/(expense), net. the changes in other income/(expense), net were mostly due to foreign exchange impact from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances.32provision for income taxes  three months ended june 30,   six months ended june

taxes in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 increased $157 million, or 28%, and $293 million, or 30%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to increases in pre-tax income, partially offset by decreases in the effective tax rate. our effective tax rate in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 decreased compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to increases in pre-tax income in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than that of the united states. we have not provided united states taxes for all foreign earnings because we intend to indefinitely reinvest a substantial portion of those earnings outside of the united states.our effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the impact of operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the united states, acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business, non-deductible share-based compensation, and tax research credits. there was no material impact from acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions. our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing, size, and integration of any acquisitions we make.33liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $23.29 billion as of june 30, 2016, an increase of $4.86 billion from december 31, 2015, primarily due to $6.18 billion of cash generated from operations and $961 million in excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, partially offset by $2.13 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $312 million for principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations.cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $407 million for the first six months of 2016. as of june 30, 2016, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $2.21 billion, and we anticipate that a relatively small portion of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2016. as of june 30, 2016, we had $795 million of federal tax credits, of which a substantial portion will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2016.in may 2016, we terminated our undrawn five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to $6.5 billion, and entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2016 facility). any amounts outstanding under the 2016 facility will be due and payable on may 20, 2021. as of june 30, 2016, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under the 2016 facility.as of june 30, 2016, $2.63 billion of the $23.29 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided for residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary.we currently anticipate that our available funds, cash flow from operations, and credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2016, mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $1.55 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.14 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in net income as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities was $6.65 billion for the first six months of 2016, mostly due to $4.57 billion for net purchases of marketable securities, and $2.13 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers and servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. the increase in cash used in investing activities during the first six months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, and in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses.we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2016 of approximately $4.5 billion.cash provided by financing activitiescash flow from financing activities during the first six months of 2016 mostly consisted of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity and principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations. the decrease in cash provided by financing activities during the first six months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was mostly due to higher principal payments related to our capital lease and other financing obligations, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefit from share-based award activity.off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2016.contractual obligationsthere were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015.34contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 8 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding these contingencies.recent accounting pronouncementin february 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. we are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net) (asu 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. the guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. we are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvement to employee share-based payment accounting (asu 2016-09) to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, an option to recognize gross share-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017, and early adoption is permitted. we are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015.35item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.certain revenue information in the section entitled "—three and six months ended june 30, 2016 and 2015—revenue—foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.executive overview of second quarter resultsour key user metrics and financial results for the second quarter of 2016 are as follows:user growth:•daily active users (daus) were 1.13 billion on average for june 2016, an increase of 17% year-over-year.•mobile daus were 1.03 billion on average for june 2016, an increase of 22% year-over-year.•monthly active users (maus) were 1.71 billion as of june 30, 2016, an increase of 15% year-over-year.•mobile maus were 1.57 billion as of june 30, 2016, an increase of 20% year-over-year.financial results:•revenue was $6.44 billion, up 59% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $6.24 billion, up 63% year-over-year.•total costs and expenses were $3.69 billion.•income from operations was $2.75 billion.•net income was $2.06 billion with diluted earnings per share of $0.71.•capital expenditures were $995 million.•effective tax rate was 26%.•cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $23.29 billion as of june 30, 2016.•headcount was 14,495 as of june 30, 2016.in the second quarter of 2016, we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through expanded capabilities of tools for marketers.we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the facebook app and platform, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as messenger, instagram, whatsapp and video, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives that we believe will further our mission to connect the world, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2015.21trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), mobile daus, maus, mobile maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated. trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 22worldwide daus increased 17% to 1.13 billion on average during june 2016 from 968 million during june 2015. we experienced growth in daus across major markets, including india, brazil, and the united states. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in june 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline.•mobile daus. we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger mobile application (and is also a registered facebook user) on a given day. we define a mobile-only dau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day, whereas a mobile dau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer on that day. worldwide mobile daus increased 22% to 1.03 billion on average during june 2016 from 844 million during june 2015. in all regions, an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during june 2016, as compared to the same period during 2015, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during june 2016. on average during june 2016, there were 885 million mobile-only daus, increasing 29% from 688 million mobile-only daus during the same period in 2015. the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.23•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.as of june 30, 2016, we had 1.71 billion maus, an increase of 15% from june 30, 2015. users in india, indonesia, and the united states represented key sources of growth in the second quarter of 2016, relative to the same period in 2015. overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in june 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline.24•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger mobile application (and is also a registered facebook user) during the period of measurement. we define a mobile-only mau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement, whereas a mobile mau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement.worldwide mobile maus increased 20% to 1.57 billion as of june 30, 2016 from 1.31 billion as of june 30, 2015. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, with users in india, the united states, and brazil representing key sources of mobile mau growth in the second quarter of 2016. there were 967 million mobile-only maus as of june 30, 2016, increasing 48% from 655 million mobile-only maus during the same period in 2015. the remaining 607 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during june 2016. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.25trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in the second quarter of 2016 in the united states & canada region was more than eight times higher than in the asia-pacific region.note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography in late 2015. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide revenue, it did affect our attribution of revenue to different geographic regions. the fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and arpu amounts for all regions were adjusted to reflect this reclassification.26during the second quarter of 2016, worldwide arpu was $3.82, an increase of 38% from the second quarter of 2015. over this period, arpu increased by 54% in united states & canada, 40% in europe, 37% in asia-pacific, and 26% in rest of world. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.27components of results of operationsrevenueadvertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties, such as our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.payments and other fees. we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales, and our ad serving and measurement products. cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, energy and bandwidth costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include professional and legal services. general and administrative expenses also include depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets we have acquired.28results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed

first six months of 2016 increased $2.39 billion, or 59%, and $4.23 billion, or 56%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. the increases were primarily due to increases in advertising revenue.the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices. for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 84% and 83%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 76% and 74%, respectively in the same periods in 2015. factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) an increase in mobile user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. however, we anticipate increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed will be a less significant driver of our revenue growth in the future.in addition, during the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, the average price per ad increased by 9% and 7%, respectively, and the number of ads delivered increased by 49% and 50%, respectively. the 30increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed, while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth.payments and other fees revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 decreased $18 million, or 8%, and $64 million, or 14%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. the decreases in payments and other fees revenue were primarily due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers. facebook usage on personal computers has been declining and will continue to decline in the future, resulting in a continuing decline in our payments revenue. we anticipate the decline in our payments revenue will be offset, in part or in whole, by the revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales.foreign exchange impact on revenuethe foreign exchange impact on our revenue and advertising revenue from the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2016 was not material.the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the six months ended june 30, 2016 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue would have been $12.02 billion, and our advertising revenue would have been $11.64 billion. using these constant rates, both revenue and advertising revenue would have been $203 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the first six months of 2016.cost of revenue three months ended june 30,   six months ended june 30,   2016 2015 % change 2016 2015 % change (in

periods were due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 34% growth in employee headcount from june 30, 2015 to june 30, 2016 in engineering and other technical functions. additionally, in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, our equipment and related expenses to support our research and development efforts increased $34 million and $71 million, respectively, and our changes to the fair value of our contingent liability increased $31 million and $45 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.31marketing and

income/(expense), net as a result of higher invested cash balances and interest rates, which for the second quarter of 2016, was partially offset by a decrease in other income/(expense), net. in the first six months of 2016, the increase in other income/(expense), net also contributed to the increase in interest and other income/(expense), net. the changes in other income/(expense), net were mostly due to foreign exchange impact from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances.32provision for income taxes  three months ended june 30,   six months ended june

taxes in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 increased $157 million, or 28%, and $293 million, or 30%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to increases in pre-tax income, partially offset by decreases in the effective tax rate. our effective tax rate in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 decreased compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to increases in pre-tax income in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than that of the united states. we have not provided united states taxes for all foreign earnings because we intend to indefinitely reinvest a substantial portion of those earnings outside of the united states.our effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the impact of operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the united states, acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business, non-deductible share-based compensation, and tax research credits. there was no material impact from acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions. our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing, size, and integration of any acquisitions we make.33liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $23.29 billion as of june 30, 2016, an increase of $4.86 billion from december 31, 2015, primarily due to $6.18 billion of cash generated from operations and $961 million in excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, partially offset by $2.13 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $312 million for principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations.cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $407 million for the first six months of 2016. as of june 30, 2016, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $2.21 billion, and we anticipate that a relatively small portion of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2016. as of june 30, 2016, we had $795 million of federal tax credits, of which a substantial portion will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2016.in may 2016, we terminated our undrawn five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to $6.5 billion, and entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2016 facility). any amounts outstanding under the 2016 facility will be due and payable on may 20, 2021. as of june 30, 2016, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under the 2016 facility.as of june 30, 2016, $2.63 billion of the $23.29 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided for residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary.we currently anticipate that our available funds, cash flow from operations, and credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2016, mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $1.55 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.14 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to an increase in net income as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities was $6.65 billion for the first six months of 2016, mostly due to $4.57 billion for net purchases of marketable securities, and $2.13 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers and servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. the increase in cash used in investing activities during the first six months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, and in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses.we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2016 of approximately $4.5 billion.cash provided by financing activitiescash flow from financing activities during the first six months of 2016 mostly consisted of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity and principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations. the decrease in cash provided by financing activities during the first six months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was mostly due to higher principal payments related to our capital lease and other financing obligations, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefit from share-based award activity.off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2016.contractual obligationsthere were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015.34contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 8 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding these contingencies.recent accounting pronouncementin february 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. we are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net) (asu 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. the guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. we are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvement to employee share-based payment accounting (asu 2016-09) to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, an option to recognize gross share-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017, and early adoption is permitted. we are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015.35
