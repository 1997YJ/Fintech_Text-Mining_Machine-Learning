references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and
financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of third quarter 2015 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
third quarter 2015 earnings were $4.2 billion, or
$1.01 per diluted share, compared with $8.1 billion a year
earlier. significantly lower upstream realizations more than offset higher
downstream and chemical earnings.
 
the
corporation maintains a relentless focus on business fundamentals, including
cost management, regardless of commodity prices. quarterly results reflect the
continued strength of our downstream and chemical businesses and underscore the
benefits of our integrated business model.
 
upstream
production volumes increased 2.3 percent, or 87,000 barrels per day,
to 3.9 million oil‑equivalent barrels per day. liquids volumes of
2.3 million barrels per day rose 13 percent driven by new
developments in canada, indonesia, the united states, angola and nigeria.  



 


 


 



 
earnings
in the first nine months of 2015 were $13.4 billion, down
$12.6 billion, or 48 percent, from 2014.
 
earnings
per share, assuming dilution, decreased 47 percent to $3.18.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $23.6 billion, down 16 percent from
2014.
 
oil‑equivalent
production increased 2.7 percent from 2014, with liquids up
10 percent and natural gas down 5.7 percent.
 
the
corporation distributed $11.5 billion to shareholders in the first nine
months of 2015 through $9 billion in dividends and $2.5 billion in
share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

upstream
earnings were $1,358 million in the third quarter of 2015, down
$5,058 million from the third quarter of 2014. lower liquids and gas
realizations decreased earnings by $5.1 billion, while volume and mix
effects, driven by new developments, increased earnings by $110 million.
all other items decreased earnings by $70 million.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production increased 2.3 percent from the
third quarter of 2014. liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per
day, up 266,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects partly offset by field decline. natural gas production was
9.5 billion cubic feet per day, down 1.1 billion cubic feet per day
from 2014 due to regulatory restrictions in the netherlands and field decline,
partly offset by project volumes.
 
u.s.
upstream earnings declined $1,699 million from the third quarter of 2014
to a loss of $442 million in the third quarter of 2015. non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $1,800 million, down $3,359 million from the
prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings were $6,244 million for the first nine months of 2015, down
$15,836 million from 2014. lower realizations decreased earnings by
$15.1 billion. favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$680 million. all other items, primarily the absence of prior year asset
management gains, decreased earnings by $1.5 billion.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was
up 2.7 percent compared to the same period in 2014. liquids production of
2.3 million barrels per day increased 213,000 barrels per day, with
project ramp‑up and entitlement effects partly offset by field decline.
natural gas production of 10.5 billion cubic feet per day decreased
630 million cubic feet per day from 2014 as regulatory restrictions in the
netherlands and field decline were partly offset by project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects.
 
u.s.
upstream earnings declined $4,235 million from 2014 to a loss of
$541 million for the first nine months of 2015. earnings outside the u.s.
were $6,785 million, down $11,601 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2015 was $9.7 billion,
including asset sales of $0.5 billion, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the
comparable 2014 period due to lower earnings partially offset by higher
proceeds from asset sales.
 
cash provided by operating
activities totaled $26.0 billion for the first nine months of 2015, $11.7
billion lower than 2014. the major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $13.7 billion, a decrease of $13.1 billion from the prior year
period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $13.3 billion for
depreciation and depletion increased by $0.5 billion. changes in operational
working capital decreased cash flows by $1.0 billion in 2015 and $0.5 billion
in 2014. all other items net had no impact on cash in 2015 and decreased cash
by $1.5 billion in 2014. for additional details, see the condensed consolidated
statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2015 used net cash of $18.5 billion, a decrease of
$0.4 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $20.4 billion was $3.7 billion lower than 2014. proceeds
from asset sales of $1.6 billion decreased $2.2 billion. additional investment
and advances decreased $0.9 billion to $0.4 billion. other investing activities
– net decreased $2.7 billion to $0.7 billion.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2015 was $27.6 billion,
including asset sales of $1.6 billion, and decreased $13.9 billion from the
comparable 2014 period primarily due to lower earnings and lower proceeds from
asset sales.
 
during the first quarter
of 2015, the corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt and used part of
the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used in financing activities
of $7.5 billion in the first nine months of 2015 was $11.6 billion lower than
2014 reflecting the 2015 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of shares
of exxonmobil stock in 2015.
  
during the third
quarter of 2015, exxon mobil corporation purchased 6.5 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $500 million. these purchases
were to reduce the number of shares outstanding. shares outstanding decreased
from 4,169 million at the end of second quarter to 4,163 million at the end of
the third quarter 2015. purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.


19  



 

the corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $3.6
billion in the third quarter of 2015 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015 compared to
$5.0 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2014.
 
total debt of $34.3
billion compared to $29.1 billion at year-end 2014. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 16.2 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2015
compared to 13.9 percent at year-end 2014.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s
common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $14.8 billion for the third
quarter of 2015, a decrease of $6.9 billion from 2014. income tax expense
decreased by $3.7 billion to $1.4 billion reflecting lower earnings and a lower
effective tax rate. the effective income tax rate was 32 percent compared to 43
percent in the prior year period due to
favorable one-time items and a lower share of earnings in higher tax
jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other taxes
and duties decreased by $3.2 billion to $13.4 billion as a result of lower
sales realizations.



 


 


 



 
income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $45.4 billion for the first nine
months of 2015, a decrease of $20.6 billion from 2014. income tax expense
decreased by $10.3 billion to $5.6 billion as a result of lower earnings and a
lower effective tax rate. the effective income tax rate was 37 percent compared
to 43 percent in the prior year due primarily to a lower share of earnings in
higher tax jurisdictions. sales-based and all other taxes decreased by $10.3
billion to $39.8 billion as a result of lower sales
realizations.

capital and
exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2015
were $7.7 billion, down 22 percent from the third quarter of 2014, in line with
plan.



 


 


 



 
capital
and exploration expenditures in the first nine months of 2015 were $23.6
billion, down 16 percent from the first nine months of 2014 due
primarily to lower major project spending. the corporation anticipates an
average investment profile of about $34 billion per
year for the next few years. actual spending could vary depending on the
progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "factors
affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our website and in
item 1a of exxonmobil's 2014 form 10-k. we assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities

references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and
financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of third quarter 2015 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
third quarter 2015 earnings were $4.2 billion, or
$1.01 per diluted share, compared with $8.1 billion a year
earlier. significantly lower upstream realizations more than offset higher
downstream and chemical earnings.
 
the
corporation maintains a relentless focus on business fundamentals, including
cost management, regardless of commodity prices. quarterly results reflect the
continued strength of our downstream and chemical businesses and underscore the
benefits of our integrated business model.
 
upstream
production volumes increased 2.3 percent, or 87,000 barrels per day,
to 3.9 million oil‑equivalent barrels per day. liquids volumes of
2.3 million barrels per day rose 13 percent driven by new
developments in canada, indonesia, the united states, angola and nigeria.  



 


 


 



 
earnings
in the first nine months of 2015 were $13.4 billion, down
$12.6 billion, or 48 percent, from 2014.
 
earnings
per share, assuming dilution, decreased 47 percent to $3.18.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $23.6 billion, down 16 percent from
2014.
 
oil‑equivalent
production increased 2.7 percent from 2014, with liquids up
10 percent and natural gas down 5.7 percent.
 
the
corporation distributed $11.5 billion to shareholders in the first nine
months of 2015 through $9 billion in dividends and $2.5 billion in
share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

upstream
earnings were $1,358 million in the third quarter of 2015, down
$5,058 million from the third quarter of 2014. lower liquids and gas
realizations decreased earnings by $5.1 billion, while volume and mix
effects, driven by new developments, increased earnings by $110 million.
all other items decreased earnings by $70 million.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production increased 2.3 percent from the
third quarter of 2014. liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per
day, up 266,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects partly offset by field decline. natural gas production was
9.5 billion cubic feet per day, down 1.1 billion cubic feet per day
from 2014 due to regulatory restrictions in the netherlands and field decline,
partly offset by project volumes.
 
u.s.
upstream earnings declined $1,699 million from the third quarter of 2014
to a loss of $442 million in the third quarter of 2015. non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $1,800 million, down $3,359 million from the
prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings were $6,244 million for the first nine months of 2015, down
$15,836 million from 2014. lower realizations decreased earnings by
$15.1 billion. favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$680 million. all other items, primarily the absence of prior year asset
management gains, decreased earnings by $1.5 billion.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was
up 2.7 percent compared to the same period in 2014. liquids production of
2.3 million barrels per day increased 213,000 barrels per day, with
project ramp‑up and entitlement effects partly offset by field decline.
natural gas production of 10.5 billion cubic feet per day decreased
630 million cubic feet per day from 2014 as regulatory restrictions in the
netherlands and field decline were partly offset by project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects.
 
u.s.
upstream earnings declined $4,235 million from 2014 to a loss of
$541 million for the first nine months of 2015. earnings outside the u.s.
were $6,785 million, down $11,601 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2015 was $9.7 billion,
including asset sales of $0.5 billion, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the
comparable 2014 period due to lower earnings partially offset by higher
proceeds from asset sales.
 
cash provided by operating
activities totaled $26.0 billion for the first nine months of 2015, $11.7
billion lower than 2014. the major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $13.7 billion, a decrease of $13.1 billion from the prior year
period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $13.3 billion for
depreciation and depletion increased by $0.5 billion. changes in operational
working capital decreased cash flows by $1.0 billion in 2015 and $0.5 billion
in 2014. all other items net had no impact on cash in 2015 and decreased cash
by $1.5 billion in 2014. for additional details, see the condensed consolidated
statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2015 used net cash of $18.5 billion, a decrease of
$0.4 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $20.4 billion was $3.7 billion lower than 2014. proceeds
from asset sales of $1.6 billion decreased $2.2 billion. additional investment
and advances decreased $0.9 billion to $0.4 billion. other investing activities
– net decreased $2.7 billion to $0.7 billion.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2015 was $27.6 billion,
including asset sales of $1.6 billion, and decreased $13.9 billion from the
comparable 2014 period primarily due to lower earnings and lower proceeds from
asset sales.
 
during the first quarter
of 2015, the corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt and used part of
the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used in financing activities
of $7.5 billion in the first nine months of 2015 was $11.6 billion lower than
2014 reflecting the 2015 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of shares
of exxonmobil stock in 2015.
  
during the third
quarter of 2015, exxon mobil corporation purchased 6.5 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $500 million. these purchases
were to reduce the number of shares outstanding. shares outstanding decreased
from 4,169 million at the end of second quarter to 4,163 million at the end of
the third quarter 2015. purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.


19  



 

the corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $3.6
billion in the third quarter of 2015 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015 compared to
$5.0 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2014.
 
total debt of $34.3
billion compared to $29.1 billion at year-end 2014. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 16.2 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2015
compared to 13.9 percent at year-end 2014.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s
common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

billion, down 16 percent from the first nine months of 2014 due
primarily to lower major project spending. the corporation anticipates an
average investment profile of about $34 billion per
year for the next few years. actual spending could vary depending on the
progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements.
