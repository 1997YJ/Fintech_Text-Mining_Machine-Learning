attributable to chevron corporation for second quarter 2013 was $5.4 billion ($2.77 per share — diluted), compared with $7.2 billion ($3.66 per share — diluted) in the corresponding 2012 period. net income attributable to chevron corporation for the first six months of 2013 was $11.5 billion ($5.95 per share — diluted), versus $13.7 billion ($6.93 per share — diluted) in the first six months of 2012.upstream earnings were $4.9 billion in second quarter 2013 and $10.9 billion for the first six months of 2013, compared with $5.6 billion and $11.8 billion in the comparative 2012 periods. the decrease between both comparative periods was mainly due to lower crude oil realizations and volumes.downstream earnings were $766 million in second quarter 2013, compared with $1.9 billion in the year-earlier period. the decline was mainly due to lower margins on refined products, unfavorable changes in effects on derivative instruments, lower gains on asset sales and higher repair and maintenance expenses at the company's refineries. earnings for the first six months of 2013 were $1.5 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the corresponding 2012 period. the decrease was mainly due to higher operating expenses at the company's refineries, lower gains on asset sales and lower margins on refined products sales.refer to pages 29 through 32 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for second quarter and first six months of 2013 versus the same period in 2012.business environment and outlookchevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela, and vietnam.25table of contentsearnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the level of the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year.to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required. identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments.the company’s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the united states. from time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company. governments may attempt to do so in the future. civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the company’s operations or investments. those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.26table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $112 per barrel for the full-year 2012. during  2013, brent averaged $102 per barrel in the second quarter, $108 per barrel for the six-month period, and ended july at about $108. in the first quarter 2013, brent-related crudes in the atlantic basin began to decline as a result of negative economic developments, high refinery maintenance in europe and higher north sea production. this trend began to shift in early second quarter as seasonal maintenance ended and additional north sea production outages helped brent prices recover into july. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. the wti price averaged $94 per barrel for the full-year 2012. during  2013, wti averaged $94 per barrel in the second quarter, $94 for the six-month period, and ended july at about $105. wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2012 due to high inventories and excess crude supply in the u.s. midcontinent market. during  second quarter 2013 the wti discount narrowed significantly as brent prices declined on market concerns over economic growth, while u.s. infrastructure enhancements and increasing u.s. refinery demand eased inventory constraints and provided relative support to wti prices.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the differential eased globally over the first quarter 2013 as heavy refinery maintenance schedules in europe, the u.s., and elsewhere reduced demand and price support for light sweet crudes. however, the differential  recovered somewhat during the second quarter as maintenance activities have declined.chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, chad, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 35 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $3.76 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in the first six months of 2013, compared with $2.36 during the first six months of 2012. at the end of july 2013, the henry hub spot price was $3.44 per mcf. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. international natural gas realizations averaged $6.00 per mcf during the first six months of 2013, compared with $5.99 in the same period last year. (see page 35 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)the company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first six months of 2013 averaged 2.613 million barrels per day. about one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first six months of 2013 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi27table of contentsarabia and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for the second quarter or six-month periods of 2013 or 2012. at their may 2013 meeting, members of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day, which has been in effect since december 2008.the company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2013 will average approximately 2.650 million barrels per day based on a brent price of $112 per barrel. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups or ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the united states.on november 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field about 75 miles offshore brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. the source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned. no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to this seep has emerged. on march 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. as a precautionary measure, the company and its partners decided to temporarily suspend field production and received approval from brazil’s national petroleum agency (anp) to do so.  chevron and its partners are cooperating with the brazilian authorities. on july 19, 2012, anp issued its final investigative report on the november 2011 incident. on april 8, 2013, anp approved a plan for partial restoration of  production in the frade field, and production under that approved plan commenced on april 30, 2013. a brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking $10.7 billion in damages for each of the two seeps. the company is not aware of any basis for damages to be awarded in any civil lawsuit. on july 31, 2012, a court presiding over the civil litigation entered a preliminary injunction barring chevron from conducting oil production and transportation activities in brazil pending completion of the legal proceedings commenced by the federal district prosecutor and the ongoing proceedings of anp and the brazilian environment and natural resources regulatory agency. on september 28, 2012, the injunction was modified to clarify that chevron may continue its containment and mitigation activities under supervision of anp, and on appeal, the injunction was revoked in its entirety on november 27, 2012.  the prosecutor has asked the court to reconsider the revocation. the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against eleven chevron employees. jurisdiction for all three matters was moved from campos to a court in rio de janeiro. on february 19, 2013, the court dismissed the criminal matter, which is being appealed by the prosecutor. the company’s ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable, but could be significant to net income in any one period.on may 27, 2013 the company executed financing agreements with petroboscan, a joint stock company owned 39.2 percent by chevron, which operates the boscan field in venezuela. the financing will occur in stages over a limited drawdown period and will support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreed-upon level. the terms are designed to support cash needs for ongoing operations and new development, as well as distributions to shareholders - including current outstanding obligations. the loan will be repaid from future petroboscan crude sales.  final closing of the transaction will occur once all conditions precedent are satisfied. refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 29 through 31 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.28table of contentsother factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 31 through 32 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels, and technology companies.operating developmentsnoteworthy operating developments for the upstream business in recent months included the following:•angola - announced the loading of the first cargo of liquefied natural gas at the angola lng project. •argentina - signed an agreement advancing the development of shale oil and natural gas resources from the vaca muerta formation.•brazil - awarded participation in a deepwater block in the ceará basin.•canada - announced agreement to acquire additional, complementary acreage in the duvernay shale located in western canada.•kurdistan region of iraq - announced the acquisition of an 80 percent interest and operatorship of the qara dagh block.•united states - announced a joint development agreement for additional permian basin acreage and access to related infrastructure.in the downstream business, gs caltex, the company's 50 percent-owned joint venture, started commercial operations of its newest heavy oil upgrading unit at the yeosu refinery in south korea. also in the second quarter, chevron phillips chemical company llc, the company's 50 percent-owned affiliate, announced plans to expand annual ethylene production by 200 million pounds at its sweeny complex in old ocean, texas.the company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in second quarter 2013 under its share repurchase program.results of operationsbusiness segments the following section presents the results of operations for the company’s business segments — upstream and downstream — as well as for “all other.”

$235 million from the same period last year. the decrease was primarily due to higher operating and depreciation expenses of $100 million and $50 million, respectively, and lower net crude oil production of $50 million. lower crude oil realizations were mostly offset by higher natural gas realizations.earnings for the first six months of 2013 were approximately $2.2 billion, down $632 million from the corresponding period in 2012. lower crude oil realizations and higher operating expenses reduced earnings by approximately $340 million and $230 million, respectively.the company’s average realization for u.s. crude oil and natural gas liquids in second quarter 2013 was $92 per barrel, compared with $97 a year earlier. for the six-month periods, average realizations were $93 in 2013 and $100 in 2012. the average natural gas realization in second quarter 2013 was $3.78 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $2.17 in the year-ago period. the average six-month realizations were $3.44 per thousand cubic feet in 2013 and $2.33 in 2012.net oil-equivalent production of 659,000 barrels per day in second quarter 2013 was unchanged from second quarter a year earlier. net oil-equivalent production of 661,000 barrels per day in the six-month period increased 6,000 barrels per day from the corresponding 2012 period. production increases in the marcellus shale in western pennsylvania, the delaware basin in new mexico and at perdido in the gulf of mexico were offset by normal field declines elsewhere in both comparative periods.the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 455,000 barrels per day for second quarter and first six months of 2013 was down 1 percent from the corresponding 2012 periods. net natural gas production was 1.23 billion cubic feet per day in second quarter 2013 and 1.24 billion cubic feet per day for the first half of 2013, increases of 3 percent and 5 percent from comparative 2012 periods. three months endedjune

of $240 million and $220 million, respectively, and higher operating expense of $130 million, were partially offset by lower exploration expenses of $160 million. foreign currency effects increased earnings by $275 million in the 2013 quarter, compared with an earnings benefit of $219 million a year earlier.earnings for the first six months of 2013 were $8.7 billion, down $294 million from the same period in 2012. the decrease was mainly due to lower crude oil volumes and prices of  $620 million and $460 million, respectively, and higher operating expenses of about $200 million. partially offsetting these effects were lower exploration expenses of $300 million. foreign currency effects increased earnings by $447 million in the first six months of 2013, compared with an increase of $11 million a year earlier.the average realization per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in second quarter 2013 was $94 compared with $99 a year earlier. for the six-month periods, average crude oil and natural gas liquids realizations were  $98 and $105 for 2013 and 2012, respectively. the average natural gas realization per thousand cubic feet in second quarter 2013 was $5.93 compared with $6.10 in the corresponding 2012 period. between the six-month periods, the average natural gas realization increased to $6.00 per thousand cubic feet from $5.99 in 2012. international net oil-equivalent production of 1.92 million barrels per day in second quarter 2013 was down 2 percent from second quarter a year ago. normal field declines were partially offset by a project start-up in angola. international net oil-equivalent production of 1.95 million barrels per day for the six months of 2013 decreased 21,000 barrels per day from the six months of 2012. production increases from a project ramp-up in nigeria and a project start-up in angola were more than offset by normal field declines.30table of contentsthe net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 1.26

with earnings of $802 million a year earlier. earnings for the first six months of 2013 were $273 million compared to $1.3 billion in the corresponding 2012 period. the decrease in both comparative periods was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales of $330 million and $510 million, respectively. higher operating expenses, mainly reflecting repair and maintenance activities at the company's refineries, also decreased earnings by $200 million and $380 million, respectively.   refinery crude-input of 814,000 barrels per day in second quarter 2013 was down 114,000 barrels per day from the corresponding 2012 period. for the first six months of 2013, crude-input was 696,000 barrels per day, down from 926,000 barrels per day in the corresponding 2012 period. the decline in both periods was largely due to an august 2012 incident at the refinery in richmond, california that shut down the crude unit. planned turnarounds at the kapolei, hawaii and pascagoula, mississippi refineries also contributed to the decreases in the second quarter and six-month periods, respectively.  refined product sales of 1.21 million barrels per day in the quarterly period and 1.16 million barrels per day in the six-month period declined 4 percent and 8 percent, respectively, mainly due to lower gas oil, kerosene and gasoline sales. branded gasoline sales of 526,000 barrels per day for the second quarter were up 1 percent from a year ago, while sales of 513,000 barrels per day for the first six months were essentially flat with the same period a year ago. three months endedjune

operations in south korea. an unfavorable change in the effects on derivative instruments of $110 million and lower margins on refined product sales of $80 million also contributed to the decrease in the 2013 quarter. foreign currency effects increased earnings by $30 million in the 2013 quarter, compared with a decrease of $22 million a year earlier.earnings for the first six months of 2013 were $1.2 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the corresponding 2012 period. earnings decreased approximately $400 million due to lower gains on asset sales, primarily reflecting the 2012 sales of the company's fuels and finished lubricants businesses in spain and gs caltex's power operations. higher income tax expenses of $50 million also contributed to the decline. the decrease was partially offset by higher margins on refined products sales of $200 million. foreign currency effects increased earnings by $106 million, compared with a decrease of $33 million a year earlier.refinery crude-input of 872,000 barrels per day in second quarter 2013 was essentially flat with second quarter 2012. for the first six months of 2013, crude oil inputs were 845,000 barrels per day, an increase of 20,000 barrels per day over the corresponding 2012 period. the increase was primarily due to consolidation of the 64 percent-owned star petroleum refining company in thailand, beginning june 2012.31table of contentstotal refined product sales of 1.55 million barrels per day in the quarterly period and 1.50 million barrels per day in the six-month period declined 1 percent and 3

the decrease in the effective tax rate between the quarterly periods was driven by lower earnings in higher tax rate international upstream jurisdictions, in addition to the effects of foreign currency remeasurement impacts and non-recurring tax adjustments between periods. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the six-month comparative periods was primarily due to lower earnings in

at june 30, 2013, up $383 million from year-end 2012. cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2013 was $14.2 billion, compared with $18.3 billion in the year-ago period. the decline in the current period primarily reflected lower earnings. cash capital expenditures increased $3.8 billion between periods as work progressed on a number of major capital projects and new resources were acquired, including the kitimat liquefied natural gas project. the balance of cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities was relatively unchanged, reflecting a $6 billion bond issuance in june, 2013, and higher short-term borrowings. dividends the company paid dividends of $3.7 billion to common shareholders during the first six months of 2013. in july 2013, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.00 per common share, payable in september 2013.debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $20.0 billion at june 30, 2013, up from $12.2 billion at december 31, 2012. the $7.8 billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations in the first six months of 2013 included a $6 billion bond issuance in june 2013 timed in part to take advantage of historically low interest rates. the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the authorized borrowing limit under this program is $12.0 billion and the outstanding balance at june 30, 2013 was $4.6 billion. this balance is expected to decline significantly early in the third quarter as proceeds from the june bond issuance are used to retire commercial paper as it matures. the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $7.9 billion at june 30, 2013 and $6.0 billion at december 31, 2012. of these amounts, $6.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at june 30, 2013 and $5.9 billion at december 31, 2012, respectively. at june 30, 2013, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at june 30, 2013, the company had $6.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in december 2016, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at june 30, 2013. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in november 2015 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation, chevron corporation profit sharing/savings plan trust fund and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poor’s corporation and aa1 by moody’s investors service. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. the company also can modify capital spending plans during any extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the company’s high-quality debt ratings.common share repurchase program in july 2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. the company expects to repurchase between $500 million and $2 billion of its common shares per quarter, through open market purchases or in negotiated transactions at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions36table of contentsand other factors. during second quarter 2013, the company purchased 10.3 million common shares for $1.25 billion. from the inception of the program through second quarter 2013, the company has purchased 118.8 million shares for $12.5 billion.noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $1.3 billion at june 30, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively. distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $73 million during the first six months of 2013.current ratio — current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. the current ratio was 1.7 at june 30, 2013 and 1.6 at december 31, 2012. the current ratio is adversely affected by the fact that chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. at june 30, 2013, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement cost.debt ratio — total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. this ratio was 12.3 percent at june 30, 2013, and 8.2 percent at year-end 2012.pension obligations information related to pension plan contributions is included on page 15 in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.capital and exploratory expenditures total expenditures, including the company’s share of spending by affiliates, were $18.3 billion in the first six months of 2013, compared with $14.2 billion in the corresponding 2012 period. the amounts included the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $1.1 billion and $827 million in the 2013 and 2012 periods, respectively. also included were amounts related to the acquisition of additional shale acreage in several locations. expenditures for upstream projects in the first six months of 2013 were $16.8 billion, representing 92 percent of the
