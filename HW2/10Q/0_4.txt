inc. | q3 2017 form 10-q | 21business seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the company’s fiscal year 2017 will include 53 weeks and will end on

year-over-year decrease in gross margin percentage during the first nine months of 2017 was due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services. the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar had an unfavorable impact on gross margin percentage during the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016.the company anticipates gross margin percentage during the fourth quarter of 2017 to be between 37.5% and 38.0%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating

federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, for which no u.s. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the lower effective tax rates during the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 were due to higher u.s. r&d credits, in part as a result of the resolution of the u.s. internal revenue service (“irs”) audit of years 2010 through 2012.the irs concluded its review of the years 2010 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2017. all years prior to 2013 are closed, and the irs is currently examining the years 2013 through 2015. the company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. while the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission’s guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by ireland, the company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes.apple inc. | q3 2017 form 10-q | 28recent accounting pronouncementsrestricted cashin november 2016, the financial accounting standards board (“fasb”) issued accounting

year-over-year decrease in gross margin percentage during the first nine months of 2017 was due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by a favorable mix of products and

same periods in 2016.the company anticipates gross margin percentage during the fourth quarter of 2017 to be between 37.5% and 38.0%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating

provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the lower effective tax rates during the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 were due to higher u.s. r&d credits, in part as a result of the resolution of the u.s. internal revenue service (“irs”) audit of years 2010 through 2012.the irs concluded its review of the years 2010 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2017. all years prior to 2013 are closed, and the irs is currently examining the years 2013 through 2015. the company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. while the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission’s guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by ireland, the company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes.apple inc. | q3 2017 form 10-q | 28recent accounting pronouncementsrestricted cashin november 2016, the financial accounting standards board (“fasb”) issued accounting
