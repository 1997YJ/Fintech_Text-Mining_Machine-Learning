in addition to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. md&a is organized as follows:•overview. discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of md&a.•results of operations. an analysis of our financial results comparing the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 to the three and nine months ended september 29, 2012.•liquidity and capital resources. an analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity.•fair value of financial instruments. discussion of the methodologies used in the valuation of our financial instruments.this interim md&a should be read in conjunction with the md&a in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 29, 2012. the various sections of this md&a contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of our form 10-k, and as may be updated in our forms 10-q. our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of october 28, 2013.overviewour results of operations for each period were as follows: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) q3 2013 q2 2013 change q3 2013 q3 2012 changenet revenue $13,483 $12,811 $672 $13,483 $13,457 $26gross

income $2,950 $2,000 $950 $2,950 $2,972 $(22)diluted earnings per common share $0.58 $0.39 $0.19 $0.58 $0.58 $—revenue in q3 2013 was up 5% from the second quarter and in line with our expectations that we provided in july 2013. the increase from q2 2013 was driven by higher platform unit sales and average selling prices. our data center group (dcg) reported revenue of $2.9 billion, up 6 percent sequentially and 12 percent year-over-year, on record unit sales. we believe the worldwide pc supply chain saw a small increase in inventory levels as customers continued to build inventory of  pcs based on our 4th generation intel core processor family (code-named haswell). however, inventory levels are still being managed well below historical averages. we are forecasting q4 2013 revenue to be two percent higher than q3 2013 at $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. this increase is at the low end of our historical seasonal average and reflects the orders we are seeing from our customers and their desire to keep inventory levels lean. the traditional pc market segment continues to be negatively impacted by the growth in ultra-mobile devices such as tablets, and there is customer uncertainty about this trend and other technology transitions. however, with the launch of our haswell and bay trail designs, we believe we have competitive offerings in both tablets and convertibles to address this continuing trend. 33intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)our gross margin percentage in q3 2013 increased four percentage points from q2 2013, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs, higher platform average selling prices and unit sales, and lower pre-qualification product costs as well as higher sell-through of previously non-qualified units. the unit cost decline is due to our 22nm process technology coming down the cost curve as we ramp haswell products in multiple fabs. in addition, factory start-up costs came down as spending on process engineers was transitioned from cost of sales to r&d for the development of our next-generation 10nm process technology. gross margin was up one percentage point in q3 2013 compared to our expectations in july 2013 mainly due to higher platform average selling prices and lower platform unit costs. our q4 2013 gross margin percentage is expected to be one percentage point lower compared to q3 2013 as we increase factory spending on our 14nm process technology. r&d combined with mg&a spending in q3 2013 of $4.7 billion was flat compared to q2 2013 and down slightly compared to our expectations in july 2013. restructuring and asset impairment charges in q3 2013 were $124 million. these charges were a result of several announced management actions to reduce workforce, exit certain businesses and close facilities in response to the current business environment and to better align resources.in q3 2013, we continued to ramp sales of our haswell 4th generation intel® core™ processor family  designed for notebooks (including ultrabook™ systems and convertibles), desktops, tablets and other touch-enabled devices. platform variations within this family of processors delivered our most significant increase in power savings from a previous generation. in the data center market segment, we launched our intel® xeon® processors manufactured using our 22nm process technology, as well as our next-generation intel® atom™ microarchitecture platforms designed for use in the microserver market segment (code-named "avoton"). additionally, we launched 15 new 22nm intel® atom® microarchitecture platforms (code-named “silvermont”) designed for use in a variety of ultra-mobile form factors across various screen sizes and system price points in both traditional pcs and tablets (code-named “bay trail”) and smartphones (code-named “merrifield”).in addition to the products launched during q3 2013, we announced intel® quark, our newest architecture. intel quark is an ultra-low power and cost architecture designed for the internet-of-things, from industrial machines to future wearable devices. in the wireless business, our multi-mode data modem is now available in the samsung galaxy tab* 3 and by the end of 2013 we expect to have the voice-over-lte (volte) version available for customers, and our second generation volte product with carrier aggregation is expected to be available in the first half of 2014. on the manufacturing front, we continue to make progress with the industry’s first 14nm manufacturing process and our second generation 3-d transistors (code-named “broadwell”). broadwell is up-and-running as we demonstrated at the intel developer forum in september 2013, however we now anticipate that we will begin production in the first quarter of 2014 and broadwell is expected to launch in the second half of 2014; a shift of about a quarter.the cash generation from our business remained strong with cash from operations of $5.7 billion in q3 2013. we ended q3 2013 with an investment portfolio of $19.1 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. during q3 2013, we purchased $2.9 billion in capital assets and returned cash to stockholders by paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $536 million of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. in september 2013, the board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share to be paid in december 2013. our business outlook for q4 2013 and full-year 2013 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general and administrative (mg&a)), and capital expenditures. we will keep our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10-q. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the business outlook and forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and at other times. 34intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)the forward-looking statements in the business outlook will be effective through the close of business on december 13, 2013 unless updated earlier. from the close of business on december 13, 2013 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for january 16, 2014, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet period, the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on october 15, 2013, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the sec, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.starting with the earnings announcement for the quarter ended september 28, 2013, we post our quarterly earnings results on our investor relations website, at www.intc.com/results.cfm, and no longer distribute our quarterly financial results via a news wire service.results of operations – third quarter of 2013 compared to

share $0.58   $0.58  our net revenue for q3 2013 increased $26 million, compared to q3 2012. the increase was driven by the pc client group (pccg) and dcg platform average selling prices which increased 4% primarily on the pccg and dcg performance market segments on a richer platform mix and to a lesser extent higher intelligent systems group (isg) platform average selling prices. these increases were offset by 4% lower unit sales in the pccg and dcg platform on softness in traditional pc demand, partially offset by growth in the enterprise market segment, as well as lower intel mobile communications (imc) platform unit sales.our overall gross margin dollars for q3 2013 decreased $101 million, or 1%, compared to q3 2012. the decrease was primarily due to $374 million of higher factory start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology. this decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from the pccg and dcg platform as well as higher isg revenue. our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 62.4% in q3 2013 from 63.3% in q3 2012. the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in our other intel architecture (other ia) and pccg segments partially offset by an increase in our dcg segment. we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2013 and q3 2012 from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg operating segments. 35intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)pc client groupthe

pccg operating segment decreased by $304 million, or 3%, in q3 2013 compared to q3 2012. pccg platform unit sales were down 4%. the decrease in revenue was driven by lower notebook and desktop platform unit sales which were down 3% and 5%, respectively. pccg platform average selling prices were up 1% driven by 6% higher desktop platform average selling prices on platform mix partially offset by 3% lower notebook platform average selling prices. operating income decreased by $86 million, or 3%, in q3 2013 compared to q3 2012 driven by $206 million of lower gross margin, partially offset by $120 million of lower operating expenses. the decrease in gross margin was driven by $305 million of higher factory start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology and lower platform revenue. these decreases were partially offset by lower platform unit costs and sell through of previously non-qualified units. data center groupthe revenue and operating income for the dcg

growth in the internet cloud computing and high performance computing market segments.operating income increased by $190 million, or 16%, in q3 2013 compared to q3 2012 driven entirely by higher gross margin. gross margin was positively impacted by higher platform revenue partially offset by $56 million higher factory start-up costs for our next generation 14nm process technology and higher unit

partially offset by higher isg platform average selling prices. the operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by $371 million in q3 2013 compared to q3 2012. the decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses in the other ia operating segments on r&d investments in our smartphone and tablet products as well as higher cost of sales as we ramp our tablet business.  additionally, lower imc and netbook platform revenue contributed to the decrease.  these decreases were partially offset by higher isg revenue.36intel corporationmanagement's

restructuring programin response to the current business environment, during the third quarter of 2013, management approved and communicated several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions as well as exit of certain businesses and facilities. these actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in massachusetts, which we expect to cease production by the end of 2014. these targeted reductions will enable the company to focus our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the changing market.  restructuring and asset impairment charges at

impairment charges in the consolidated condensed statements of income within the “all other” operating segment. the charges incurred during the third quarter of 2013 included $85 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements, which impacted approximately 1,900 employees. the largest portion of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing. a majority of the remaining accrual as of  september 28, 2013 relates to employee severance and benefits which are expected to be paid within the next 12 months and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated condensed balance sheet. employee severance and benefits expected to be paid in periods beyond 12 months were recorded within other long-term liabilities in the consolidated condensed balance sheet.we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $155 million. we will begin to realize these savings in q4 2013 and will fully realize a majority of these savings within cost of sales beginning in q1 2015. we may incur additional charges in the future under this restructuring plan for employee severance and benefit arrangements, as well as other facility or exit activities.  gains (losses) on equity investments and interest and othergains (losses) on equity investments, net and

in traditional pc demand partially offset by growth in the enterprise market segment. additionally, lower netbook platform and imc platform unit sales contributed to the decrease. this decrease was partially offset by higher average selling prices on the pccg and dcg platform, which were up 3%, as well as higher isg platform average selling prices. our overall gross margin dollars for the first nine months of 2013 decreased $2.4 billion, or 9%, compared to the first nine months of 2012. the decrease was primarily due to $1.3 billion of higher factory start-up costs primarily for our next-generation 14nm process technology as well as lower revenue on the pccg and dcg platform. additionally, lower revenue from the other ia operating segments and $249 million of higher excess capacity charges, primarily in the first three months of 2013, contributed to the decrease. our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 59.0% in the first nine months of 2013 from 63.6% in the first nine months of 2012. the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in pccg. we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin

higher gains on sales of equity investments and higher cash dividends, partially offset by lower gains on third-party merger transactions and sales. net gains on equity investments in the first nine months of 2013 included a gain of $439 million on the sale of our interest in clearwire llc, which had been accounted for as an equity method investment, and our shares in clearwire corporation, which had been accounted for as available-for-sale marketable equity securities.we recognized an interest and other, net loss in the first nine months of 2013 compared to a net gain in the first nine months of 2012. we recognized a net loss in the first nine months of 2013 due to higher interest expense because of the issuance of our $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in q4

retroactive to the beginning of 2012. the majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate between the first nine months of 2013 and the first nine months of 2012 was driven by the recognition of the 2012 u.s. r&d tax credit in q1 2013. the effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the portion of the 2013 u.s. r&d tax credit recognized in the first nine months of 2013.liquidity and

operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.cash from operations in the first nine months of 2013 was $14.7 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion compared to the first nine months of 2012 due to changes in our working capital, partially offset by lower net income in the first nine months of 2013. income taxes paid, net of refunds, in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012 were $1.2 billion lower due to lower income before taxes in 2013 and 2012 income tax overpayments.changes in assets and liabilities as of september 28, 2013 compared to december 29, 2012 included lower income taxes payable and receivable resulting from a reduction in taxes due in 2013.  in the first nine months of 2013, our three largest customers accounted for 44% of net revenue (42% in the first nine months of 2012) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 17% of our net revenue (18% in the first nine months of 2012), dell inc. accounting for 15% of our net revenue (14% in the first nine months of 2012), and lenovo group limited accounting for 12% of our net revenue (10% in the first nine months of 2012). these three customers accounted for 30% of net accounts receivable as of september 28, 2013 (33% as of december 29, 2012).investing activitiesthe increase in cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the first nine months of 2012, was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in the first nine months of 2013, as compared to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in the first nine months of 2012.financing activitiesthe decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the first nine months of 2012, was due to lower repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in the first nine months of 2013, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans.liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of september 28, 2013, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $19.1 billion ($18.2 billion as of december 29, 2012). in addition to the $19.1 billion, we have $1.7 billion in other long-term investments and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first nine months of 2013 was $300 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of september 28, 2013. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of september 28, 2013. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.43intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)as of september 28, 2013, $10.8 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $10.8 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $1.8 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of september 28, 2013. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 2: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of september 28, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $19.5 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $6.1 billion was classified as level 1, $13.3 billion as level 2, and $71 million as level 3.our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $13.3 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 55% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 45% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3, are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.  loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of september 28, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $799 million of loans receivable and $750 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of september 28, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.5 billion of marketable equity securities. all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.44
