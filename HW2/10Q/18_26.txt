overview

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital economy. our primary component-level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash
memory. net revenue, gross margin, operating income, and net income for the first quarter of 2010,
the fourth quarter of 2009, and the first quarter of 2009 were as follows:

after the first quarter of 2009, we believed we were at the bottom of the severe industry
correction that began in 2008. revenue increased in each quarter of 2009, and the strength of our
business model can be seen in our first quarter of 2010 results with record first quarter revenue
and operating income. our first quarter revenue was stronger than we expected based on demand for
our new 32nm process technology mobile products. revenue in the pc client group was flat from the
fourth quarter on higher mobile average selling prices partially offset by seasonal unit declines,
despite a 19% decline in overall intel® atom™ processor and chipset revenue.

we believe the downstream supply chain has replenished inventory over the last year and now is at
normal levels. entering the first quarter, we planned to build additional internal inventory as we
started the ramp of our new 32nm products. though we have enough inventory for current demand
projections, better than expected demand in the first quarter prevented us from getting as much
buffer inventory in place as we would have liked.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our overall gross margin percentage was better than expected, declining slightly from the record
gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter. this slight decline was a result of higher platform
(microprocessor and chipset) unit costs due to a higher proportion of early ramp 32nm process
technology products and, to a lesser extent, lower microprocessor sales volume. more recently
introduced products tend to have higher average costs which decline as production ramps. this was
partially offset by slightly higher average selling prices due to the higher proportion of premium mobile products. we expect our gross margin
percentage to increase in the second quarter as unit costs decline on the continued ramp of 32nm
process technology.

our product lineup is well positioned across the computing spectrum. the ramp of the 32nm process
technology is the fastest in our history. in march 2010, we introduced the intel® xeon® processor
5600 series, our first server and workstation microprocessors based on 32nm process technology.
these processors combine robust security capabilities with significantly increased performance over
previous generation processors. we continue to execute on our “tick-tock” technology development
cadence and are on track to deliver new 32nm process technology products based on the new sandy
bridge microarchitecture later in 2010.

from a financial condition perspective, we ended the first quarter of 2010 with an investment
portfolio of $16.3 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, trading assets, and short-term
investments. the cash generating power of our business was evident in the first quarter of 2010
with $4.1 billion of cash from operations. during the first quarter of 2010, we returned $870
million to stockholders through dividends, and in march, our board of directors declared a dividend
of $.1575 per common share to be paid in june.

strategy

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital economy. as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use
our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our
financial resources, global presence, brand recognition, and software development. we believe that
we have the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to
customers’ needs quickly.

some of our key focus areas are listed below:



 
•
 
customer orientation. our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of
products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. in turn, our products help
enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and
consumers. we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured
to work together to provide an optimized computing solution compared to components that are
used separately.


 
•
 
architecture and platforms. we are focusing on improved energy-efficient
performance for computing and communications systems and devices. improved energy-efficient
performance involves balancing improved performance with lower power consumption. we
continue to develop multi-core microprocessors with an increasing number of cores, which
enable improved multitasking and energy efficiency. in addition, to meet the demands of new
and evolving netbook, consumer electronics, and various embedded market segments, we offer
and are continuing to develop system on a chip (soc) products that are designed to provide
improved performance due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and smaller form
factors.


 
•
 
silicon and manufacturing technology leadership. our strategy for developing
microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new
microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. we plan to introduce a
new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon
process technology in the intervening years. this coordinated schedule allows us to develop
and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for
the next generation of silicon process technology. we refer to this as our “tick-tock”
technology development cadence. in keeping with this cadence, we expect to introduce a new
microarchitecture using our 32nm process technology later this year.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)




 
•
 
strategic investments. we make investments in companies around the world that we believe will
generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business
initiatives. our investments, including those made through our intel capital program,
generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital
economy, create new business opportunities for intel, and expand global markets for our
products. our current investments primarily focus on the following areas: advancing flash
memory products, enabling mobile wireless devices, advancing the digital home, enhancing the
digital enterprise, advancing high-performance communications infrastructures, and developing
the next generation of silicon process technologies.


 
•
 
business environment and software. we believe that we are well positioned in
the technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote
industry standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. we plan
to continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer
products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. we frequently
participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical
specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted by standards-setting
organizations. through our software and services group, we help enable and advance the
computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers
create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms.
lastly, we believe that the software expertise of our wind river software group will
expedite our growth strategy in the embedded and handheld market segments.



we believe that the proliferation of the internet has driven the need for greater performance in
pcs and servers. older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that businesses and
individual consumers demand, such as video streaming and editing, web conferencing, online gaming,
social networking, and other memory-intensive applications. as these tasks become even more
demanding and require more computing power, we believe that businesses and individual consumers
will need and want to buy new pcs. we also believe that increased internet traffic and the
increasing use of cloud computing, in which a group of linked servers provide a variety of
applications and data to users over the internet, create a need for greater server infrastructure,
including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization.

we believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop
microprocessor units will continue and that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in
the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power
microprocessors. we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to
that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers, as a growing number of
households have multiple devices for different computing functions. our silicon and manufacturing
technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses
and form factors. we believe that intel atom processors give us the ability to extend intel®
architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including a growing number of products that
require processors specifically designed for embedded applications, handhelds, consumer
electronics devices, and netbooks. we expect that our intel atom developer program will spur
new applications that run on products using intel atom processors, which will expedite our
growth strategy in these new market segments. the common elements for products in these new market
segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the internet.

we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many-core architecture aimed at
parallel processing, the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task. this
architecture will initially be used as a software development platform for graphics and throughput
computing (the need for large amounts of computing performance consistently over a long period of
time). over time, this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific
and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications.

in addition, we offer, and are continuing to develop, advanced nand flash memory products, focusing
on system-level solutions for intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives. in support
of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development
of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non-volatile,
low-cost, high-density memory.

critical accounting estimates

the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial statements. some of
our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of
the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical
accounting estimates include:




 
•
 
the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments,
net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;


 
•
 
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which primarily impacts
gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their
depreciation;


 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including
the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and


 
•
 
the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin.



below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.

non-marketable equity investments

we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from
early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature
companies with established revenue streams and business models. the carrying value of our
non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $3.3 billion as
of march 27, 2010 ($3.4 billion as of december 26, 2009). the majority of this balance as of march
27, 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. our flash memory market
segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies, llc (imft) and im flash
singapore, llp (imfs) of $1.6 billion ($1.6 billion as of december 26, 2009). for further
information, see “note 10: non-marketable equity investments” in the notes to consolidated
condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method
of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable
equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance
sheets.

non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of the companies in which we
invest could fail. their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance,
operational efficiency, and other key business factors. depending on their future prospects, the
companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive
lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our
investments would likely become impaired. additionally, financial markets and credit markets are
volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability
to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our
investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales.
for further information about our investment portfolio risks, see “risk factors” in part ii, item
1a of this form 10-q.

we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure
purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is
recognized. we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market
and income approaches. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of
comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance
multiples. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a
number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, development
stages, and other relevant factors. in addition, the market approach includes the use of quoted
prices in active markets. the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model,
which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following
significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed
market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the
risk profile of comparable companies. estimates of market segment size, market segment share,
expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and/or intel using
historical data and available market data. the valuation of our non-marketable investments also
takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing
activities by the investees, the investees’ capital structure, and differences in seniority and
rights associated with the investees’ capital.

30



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

for non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment
and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that
impact the fair value of the investment, such as:




 
•
 
the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones
and overall business prospects;


 
•
 
the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;


 
•
 
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area,
including adverse regulatory or economic changes;


 
•
 
factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the
investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash;
and


 
•
 
the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.



if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is
other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes
assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before
disposal. if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the
investment to its fair value. impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $46 million in
the first quarter of 2010. over the past 12 quarters, including the first quarter of 2010,
impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $11 million to $896 million per
quarter. this range included impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008,
primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire
communications, llc (clearwire llc).

imft/imfs

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand
products to intel and micron technology, inc. at manufacturing cost. we determine the fair value of
our investment in imft/imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business, which requires the use of
unobservable inputs. unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective
judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. changes in management
estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value
determination. we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in imft/imfs in
the first quarters of 2010 and 2009. it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair
value determination could change in the near term, which could result in an impairment of our
investment.

long-lived assets

we assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. factors that we
consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of
a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic
trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. we measure the
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying
value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash
flows. if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted
cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is measured by
comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. fair value
is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and
property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are recorded at fair value
only when an impairment charge is recognized.

impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of
identifiable independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of
our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the
independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective
judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor
manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the
assets’ new, shorter useful lives. over the past 12 quarters, including the first quarter of 2010,
impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $40 million to $300
million per quarter.

31



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

income taxes

we must make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement
purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and
deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from
differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement
purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant
changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a
subsequent period.

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery
is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we
will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance
sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our
tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.
recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to
holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect
to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes.

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we
determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step
requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to
estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we
re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors
such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively
settled issues. determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires
judgment. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax
benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

inventory

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
inventory that is not of saleable quality. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory
requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. the estimate of future demand is
compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. as of march 27, 2010, we had total work-in-process inventory of
$1,473 million and total finished goods inventory of $1,049 million. the demand forecast is
included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between
inventory valuation and build decisions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the
inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life
cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an
assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. if our demand forecast for
specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output
accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross
margin.

in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine
normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings
of wafers compared to total available capacity. if the factory loadings are below the established
normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the
cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would
negatively impact our gross margin. we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. over the
past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter.

accounting changes and recent accounting standards

for a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected
dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated condensed financial
statements, see “note 2: accounting changes” and “note 3: recent accounting standards” in the notes
to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our net revenue for q1 2010 increased 44% compared to q1 2009. the increase was due to
significantly higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales compared to q1 2009. revenue in the
asia, japan, americas, and europe regions increased by 61%, 54%, 26%, and 10% respectively compared
to q1 2009.

our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2010 increased $3.3 billion, or 102%, compared to q1 2009.
the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, factory
underutilization charges recorded in q1 2009. our overall gross margin percentage increased to
63.4% in q1 2010 from 45.3% in q1 2009. the significant increase in the gross margin percentage was
primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the pc client group operating
segment and, to a lesser extent, gross margin percentage increases in the nand solutions group and
data center group operating segments. we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin
dollars in q1 2010, and substantially all of our overall gross margin dollars in q1 2009, from the
sale of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group operating segments. see
“business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by $2.3 billion, or 43%, in q1 2010 compared
to q1 2009. microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those designed for the notebook,
netbook, and desktop computing market segments. the increase in microprocessor revenue was
primarily due to significantly higher notebook unit sales. to a lesser extent, higher desktop and
netbook microprocessor unit sales also contributed to the increase. the increase in chipset,
motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales.

operating income increased by $2.4 billion in q1 2010 compared to q1 2009. the increase in
operating income was primarily due to higher revenue. in addition, during q1 2009, we recorded
factory underutilization charges of approximately $620 million, primarily related to
microprocessors and chipsets. to a lesser extent, lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit
costs in q1 2010 were partially offset by higher operating expenses.

data center group

net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by $607 million, or 48%, in q1 2010 compared to
q1 2009. the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor unit sales and
average selling prices. the increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to higher
chipset unit sales and higher revenue from the sale of wired connectivity products, partially
offset by lower chipset average selling prices.

operating income increased by $569 million in q1 2010 compared to q1 2009. the increase in
operating income was due to higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower chipset unit costs.

net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by $49 million, or 15%, in q1 2010
compared to q1 2009. the increase was primarily due to higher revenue within the embedded and
communications group (ecg) from higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales, partially offset by
lower microprocessor average selling prices.

operating loss for the other ia operating segments decreased by $47 million in q1 2010 compared to
q1 2009. the decrease was primarily due to higher ecg revenue and lower ecg unit costs, partially
offset by higher ecg operating expenses.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses increased
$316 million, or 26%, in q1 2010 compared to q1 2009 primarily due to higher advertising expenses,
including cooperative advertising expenses, higher profit-dependent compensation, and to a lesser
extent, expenses related to our wind river software group operating segment.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in q1
2010 (35% of net revenue in q1 2009).

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we recognized higher gains on sales and lower impairment charges on our non-marketable equity
investments in q1 2010 compared to q1 2009, partially offset by losses on equity derivatives in q1
2010 compared to gains on other equity transactions in q1 2009. net gains on equity investments in
q1 2010 included a gain of $67 million on the sale of our investment in micron.

other losses in q1 2010 primarily relate to the change in fair value of micron equity options,
which are intended to economically hedge a portion of our equity price risk associated with the
micron shares we expect to receive upon sale of numonyx. see “note 10: non-marketable equity
investments” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

we recognized lower interest income in q1 2010 compared to q1 2009 as a result of lower interest
rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. the average interest rate earned
during q1 2010 decreased by approximately 1.3 percentage points compared to q1 2009. in addition,
we recognized $25 million of fair value gains on our trading assets in q1 2009.

our effective income tax rate in q1 2010 was 29.1% compared to zero in q1 2009. the impact of
discrete items significantly reduced our effective tax rate in q1 2009, primarily due to the
settlement of various federal and state tax matters related to prior years. in addition, our
estimated annual effective tax rate in q1 2009 was significantly reduced as a result of a high
percentage of profits in lower tax jurisdictions.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our expectations for the remainder of 2010 are provided below. the outlook does not include the
gain expected from the sale of our investment in numonyx. during the first quarter of 2010, we
signed a definitive agreement with micron and numonyx under which micron agreed to acquire numonyx
in an all-stock transaction. in exchange for our investment in numonyx, we expect to receive
approximately 67 million shares of micron common stock, and issue a $72 million short-term payable.
we have entered into equity options that economically hedge approximately 67% of the shares we
expect to receive. the senior credit facility that is supported by intel’s guarantee is expected to
be repaid in full following the closing of this transaction. we expect that the transaction will
close in the second quarter of 2010.

status of business outlook

we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with
investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking
statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q, including
any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. at the same time, we will
keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor
relations web site at www.intc.com. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook
published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we
publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the “business outlook” section and other
forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year
in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times.

from the close of business on may 28, 2010 until our quarterly earnings release is published,
presently scheduled for july 13, 2010, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet period,
the “business outlook” section and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k
filed on april 13, 2010, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be
considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update.
during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our
financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and
any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes
in assets and liabilities.

cash from operations for the first quarter of 2010 was $4.1 billion, an increase of $3.7 billion
compared to the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher operating income.

changes in assets and liabilities as of march 27, 2010 compared to december 26, 2009 included the
following:




 
•
 
income taxes payable increased as our u.s. federal estimated income tax payment for the
first quarter of 2010 is paid in the second quarter.


 
•
 
accrued compensation and benefits decreased due to payout of 2009 profit-dependant
compensation.



for the first quarter of 2010, our two largest customers accounted for 36% of net revenue (40% for
the first quarter of 2009) with one of those customers accounting for 20% of our net revenue, and
another customer accounting for 16% of our net revenue. these two largest customers accounted for
32% of net accounts receivable at march 27, 2010 (41% at december 26, 2009).

investing activities

the increase in cash used for investing activities in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the
first quarter of 2009, was driven primarily by an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale
investments and trading assets. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in capital
expenditures due to the timing of the ramp of our latest silicon process technology.

financing activities

the decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the
first quarter of 2009, was primarily due to an increase in short-term debt (drafts payable) in the
first quarter of 2010 compared to a decrease in short-term debt (drafts payable) in the first
quarter of 2009 and to a lesser extent proceeds from government grants. these increases were
partially offset by higher dividend payments.

38



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

liquidity

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. as of march 27, 2010, cash
and cash equivalents, trading assets, and short-term investments totaled $16.3 billion. in addition
to the $16.3 billion, we have $4.9 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that
we include when assessing our investment portfolio.

the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high, and we continue to be able to invest
in high-credit-quality investments. substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are
with a/a2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa-/aa3 or
better.

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing
authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the
issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the
first quarter of 2010 were $50 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of
march 27, 2010. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of
march 27, 2010. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec
pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next
12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test,
working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions
or strategic investments.

fair value of financial instruments

fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when
determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would
transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or
liability. see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of
this form 10-q.

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at
fair value on a recurring basis. when fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a
discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk and/or intel’s credit risk is factored into
the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate.

marketable debt instruments

as of march 27, 2010, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included
$20.5 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $609 million was classified as
level 1, $19.1 billion as level 2, and $745 million as level 3.

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable
market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. management judgment was
required to determine the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met
for a market to be considered active. our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt
instruments generally takes into consideration four weeks of activity prior to the valuation date
of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument trades and
the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued
instrument.

of the $19.1 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on
a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 55% of the balance was classified as
level 2 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model, approximately 35% due to the usage of
non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data, and
approximately 10% due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are
traded in less active markets.

39



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to
corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when
observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and
non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. all of our investments in
asset-backed securities were classified as level 3, and substantially all of them were valued using
non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market
data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities.

equity securities

as of march 27, 2010, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $926 million of marketable equity securities. of these securities, $602 million was
classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities
in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities
generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the
valuation date for individual securities, including the number of days individual equity securities
trade and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that
security. the remaining marketable equity securities of $324 million were classified as level 2
because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active
markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions.
