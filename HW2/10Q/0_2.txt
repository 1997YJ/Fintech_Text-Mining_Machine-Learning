compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the first quarter of 2018

first six months of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by a favorable shift in mix of products and services. additionally, to a lesser extent the strength in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar had a favorable impact on gross margin percentage. the company anticipates gross margin percentage during the third quarter of 2018 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; product transitions; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating

believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.apple inc. | q2 2018 form 10-q | 28on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. although ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the company expects the amount to be in line with the european commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. during the third quarter of 2018, the company expects to begin funding amounts into escrow, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes.recent accounting pronouncementshedgingin august 2017, the financial

maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.note 1, “summary of significant accounting policies” in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k, and “critical accounting policies and estimates” in part ii, item 7 of the 2017 form 10-k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. with the exception of income taxes, there have been no material changes to the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 form 10-k.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the company’s deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the act, which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the act lowered the company’s u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. during the first six months of fiscal 2018, the company recognized income tax expense of $9.3 billion, of which $2.6 billion was a provisional estimate in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118 and was recognized during the first quarter of 2018. this $2.6 billion provisional estimate included $1.8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring to reduce the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect the new tax rate, and approximately $800 million associated with the net impact of the deemed repatriation tax. resolution of the provisional estimates of the act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.item 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthis section and other parts of this quarterly report on

experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of

lesser extent the strength in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar had a favorable impact on gross margin percentage. the company anticipates gross margin percentage during the third quarter of 2018 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; product transitions; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating

and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date

decision. although ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the company expects the amount to be in line with the european commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. during the third quarter of 2018, the company expects to begin funding amounts into escrow, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any

estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.note 1, “summary of significant accounting policies” in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k, and “critical accounting policies and estimates” in part ii, item 7 of the 2017 form 10-k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. with the exception of income taxes, there have been no material changes to the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 form 10-k.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the company’s deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the act, which significantly

deferred foreign income. the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. during the first six months of fiscal 2018, the company recognized income tax expense of $9.3 billion, of which $2.6 billion was a provisional estimate in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118 and was recognized during the first quarter of 2018. this $2.6 billion provisional estimate included $1.8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring to reduce the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect the new tax rate, and approximately $800 million associated with the net impact of the deemed repatriation tax. resolution of the provisional estimates of the act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.
