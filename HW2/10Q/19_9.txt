item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsforward-looking statements    certain statements contained herein regarding our future performance constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements may relate to, among other things, the demand for our products and services; net sales growth; comparable store sales; effects of competition; state of the economy; state of the residential construction, housing and home improvement markets; state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; demand for credit offerings; inventory and in-stock positions; implementation of store, interconnected retail and supply chain initiatives; management of relationships with our suppliers and vendors; the impact and expected outcome of investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, including those related to the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014; issues related to the payment methods we accept and the timing of upgrades and enhancements impacting point of sale devices; continuation of share repurchase programs; net earnings performance; earnings per share; capital allocation and expenditures; liquidity; return on invested capital; expense leverage; stock-based compensation expense; commodity price inflation and deflation; the ability to issue debt on terms and at rates acceptable to us; the effect of accounting charges; the effect of adopting certain accounting standards; store openings and closures; financial outlook; and the integration of interline brands, inc. ("interline") into our organization and the ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of the acquisition.forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. you should not rely on our forward-looking statements. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond our control or are currently unknown to us – as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in part ii, item 1a, "risk factors" and elsewhere in this report. you should read such information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this report. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements other than as required by law. you are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission ("sec"). executive summary and selected consolidated statements of earnings datanet sales increased 6.4% to $21.8 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 from $20.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. for the first nine months of 2015, net sales increased 5.5% to $67.5 billion from $64.0 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2014. our total comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, driven by a 4.3% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 0.9% increase in our comparable store average ticket. comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 7.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. for the first nine months of fiscal 2015, our total comparable store sales increased 5.1%, and comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 6.6%.for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we reported net earnings of $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.35 compared to net earnings of $1.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.15 for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. for the first nine months of fiscal 2015, we reported net earnings of $5.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.29 compared to net earnings of $5.0 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.66 for the first nine months of fiscal 2014.the results for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 included a $144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply holdings, inc. ("hd supply"). this gain contributed $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2015. the results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 included $100 million and $212 million, respectively, of pretax gains related to the sales of portions of our equity ownership in hd supply. these gains contributed $0.05 and $0.10 to diluted earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014, respectively.the results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 included $20 million and $119 million, respectively, of pretax net expenses related to a breach of our payment data systems that we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 (the "data breach"). these charges resulted in decreases of $0.01 and $0.06 to diluted earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively. the results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 included $28 million of pretax net expenses related to the data breach, which resulted in a decrease of $0.01 to diluted earnings per share for those periods.15table of contentsthe results for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 included a $71 million net benefit to our provision for income taxes due primarily to the favorable settlement of a tax audit, resulting in a benefit of $0.05 to diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2015.during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed our accounting policy for shipping and handling costs from our stores, locations or distribution centers to customers and for online fulfillment center costs. under the new accounting policy, these costs are included in cost of sales, whereas they were previously included in operating expenses. the consolidated statements of earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 have been reclassified to reflect this change in accounting policy. the impact of this reclassification was an increase of $142 million and $424 million to cost of sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014, respectively, and a corresponding decrease to operating expenses in the same periods. this reclassification had no impact on net sales, operating income, net earnings or earnings per share.data breachas previously reported, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached, which potentially impacted customers who used payment cards at self-checkout systems in our u.s. and canadian stores. since the breach, we completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of our u.s. and canadian stores. we have also rolled out emv chip card technology in our u.s. stores, which adds extra layers of payment card protection for customers who use emv enabled chip cards. our canadian stores were already enabled with emv chip card technology.litigation, claims and government investigationsin the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the payment card networks made claims against us for costs that they assert they or their issuing banks have incurred in connection with the data breach, including incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs), and we recorded an accrual for estimated probable losses we expected to incur in connection with those claims. in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into settlement agreements with american express and discover with respect to their claims. in addition, at least 57 putative class actions have been filed in courts in the u.s. and canada allegedly arising from the data breach. the u.s. class actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia (the "district court"). that court ordered that the individual class actions be administratively closed in favor of the filing of consolidated class action complaints on behalf of customers and financial institutions allegedly harmed by the data breach. in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded an accrual for estimated probable losses that we expect to incur in connection with the u.s. customer class actions.the accruals for estimated probable losses in connection with the payment card networks' claims and the u.s. customer class actions are based on currently available information associated with those matters. these estimates may change as new information becomes available or circumstances change. our accruals are also based on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlements with the claimants and not on any determination that it is probable that we would be found liable for the losses we have accrued were these matters to be litigated.other claims have been and may be asserted against us on behalf of customers, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief allegedly arising from the data breach. in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the district court against certain present and former members of our board of directors and executive officers. we are also named as a nominal defendant in both suits, which together assert claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and violations of the securities exchange act of 1934. the lawsuits seek unspecified damages, equitable relief to reform our corporate governance structure, restitution, disgorgement of profits, benefits and other compensation obtained by the defendants, and reasonable costs and expenses. in addition, several state and federal agencies, including state attorneys general, are investigating events related to the data breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. we are cooperating in the governmental investigations, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations. while a loss from these matters, including the canadian class actions and the u.s. financial institutions class actions, is reasonably possible, we are not able to estimate the costs, or range of costs, related to these matters because the proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. we have not concluded that a loss from these matters is probable; therefore, we have not recorded an accrual for litigation, claims and governmental investigations related to these matters in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. we believe that the ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods.16table of contentsexpenses incurred and amounts accruedin the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded $20 million of pretax expenses related to the data breach. we did not record any related expected insurance proceeds in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the results for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 included $189 million of pretax gross expenses related to the data breach, partially offset by $70 million of expected insurance proceeds, for pretax net expenses of $119 million. since the data breach occurred, we have recorded $252 million of pretax gross expenses related to the data breach, partially offset by $100 million of expected insurance proceeds, for pretax net expenses of $152 million. these expenses include costs to investigate the data breach; provide identity protection services, including credit monitoring, to impacted customers; increase call center staffing; and pay legal and other professional services, all of which were expensed as incurred. expenses also include the accruals for estimated probable losses that we expect to incur in connection with the claims made by the payment card networks and the u.s. customer class actions. these expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. future costswe expect to incur additional legal and other professional services expenses associated with the data breach in future periods and will recognize these expenses as services are received. costs related to the data breach that may be incurred in future periods may include additional liabilities to payment card networks and impacted customers; liabilities from current and future civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings; future expenses for legal, investigative and consulting fees; and incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. we believe that the ultimate amount paid on these services and claims could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods.insurance coveragewe maintained $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage in fiscal 2014, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data breach. as of november 1, 2015, we had received initial payments totaling $30 million of insurance reimbursements under the fiscal 2014 policy, and expect to receive additional payments. in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into a new policy, with $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage, above a $10 million deductible, to limit our exposure to similar losses. key initiativesin the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, we continued to focus on the following key initiatives:customer service – our customer service initiative is anchored on the principles of simplifying the business, creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first and taking care of our associates. in the first nine months of fiscal 2015, we continued to utilize our second generation first phone, a handheld mobile device used by our store associates, to enhance customer service in the stores by allowing associates to convert online sales in the aisle and expedite the checkout process for customers during peak traffic periods. product authority – our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. in the first nine months of fiscal 2015, we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our professional, do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. we also continued to utilize our merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools to better understand customer preferences and to refine our product assortment in particular stores or geographic areas.disciplined capital allocation, productivity and efficiency – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we settled a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement that was entered into in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. we received a total of 13.3 million shares of our common stock under the $1.5 billion asr agreement, including 1.3 million shares received upon settlement of the agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. also during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into a $1.375 billion asr agreement and received an initial delivery of 10.1 million shares of our common stock. in addition to the asr, we repurchased 5.0 million shares of our common stock through the open market in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. during the first nine months of fiscal 2015, we repurchased a total of 42.4 million shares for $5.0 billion through asr agreements and the open market.we opened three new stores in mexico during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, for a total store count of 2,273 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015, a total of 296 of our stores, or 13.0%, were located in canada and mexico.17table of contentsin august 2015, we completed the acquisition of interline for $1.7 billion. interline is a leading national distributor and direct marketer of broad-line maintenance, repair and operations ("mro") products. we intend to leverage interline's capabilities and expertise in mro products to expand our share of the mro product market with our current customers as well as gain new customers currently served by interline. we generated $7.4 billion of cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2015. this cash flow, along with $4.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the first nine months of fiscal 2015, was used to fund $5.0 billion of share repurchases, pay $2.3 billion of dividends, purchase interline for $1.7 billion, fund $1.1 billion in capital expenditures and repay $290 million of short-term borrowings.our inventory turnover ratio was 5.0 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 4.8 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 26.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 22.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014.interconnected retail – our focus on interconnected retail, which connects our other three key initiatives, is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we continued the pilot of our new order alignment system, referred to as com, which we expect to roll out in fiscal 2016. we also continued to invest in offering our customers convenient fulfillment options for products purchased online. during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we opened and began shipping products from our third new direct fulfillment center ("dfc") located in troy township, ohio. we expect this facility, along with our other two new dfcs in california and georgia, to provide us with the capability to reach 90% of our u.s. customers in two business days or less with parcel shipping. we also opened our third online customer contact center in tempe, arizona during the quarter.in addition, approximately 42% of our online orders were picked up in our stores through our buy online, pick-up in store ("bopis") and buy online, ship to store ("boss") offerings in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. we also continued the pilot of our buy online, deliver from store ("bodfs") program, which we expect to roll out in fiscal 2016 after the roll out of com. sales from our online channels increased 25.2% and 26.4% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods last year, and represented 5.1% and 5.0% of our total net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively. outside of the u.s., we rolled out mexico's digital commerce site and re-platformed our canadian website in the first nine months of fiscal 2015. 18table of contentswe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage

meaningfuln/a – not applicable19table of contentsresults of operationsnet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 increased 6.4% to $21.8 billion from $20.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. for the first nine months of fiscal 2015, net sales increased 5.5% to $67.5 billion from $64.0 billion for the comparable period of fiscal 2014. the increase in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, partially offset by pressure from the strengthening u.s. dollar. total comparable store sales increased 5.1% for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015.the positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our maintenance and repair categories, and an improved u.s. home improvement market. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015. comparable store sales for our appliances, tools, plumbing, décor, lighting, hardware, building materials and indoor garden product categories were above the company average for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. comparable store sales for our outdoor garden, kitchen and bath, electrical, millwork, flooring, lumber and paint product categories were positive but below the company average for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 4.3% and 3.7% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively. our comparable store average ticket increased 0.9% and 1.4% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases, such as appliances, roofing and countertops, offset in part by the strength of the u.s. dollar and its resulting impact to non-u.s. dollar average ticket. gross profit increased 7.4% to $7.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 from $7.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. gross profit increased 6.0% to $23.1 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 from $21.8 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2014. gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 34 basis points to 34.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 34.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 15 basis points to 34.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared to 34.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2014. the increase in gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 reflects higher levels of co-op allowances and rebates, benefits from our supply chain driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity, and lower shrink, partially offset by contraction due to the acquisition of interline. gross profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 reflects benefits from our supply chain partially offset by a change in the mix of products sold.selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 2.0% to $4.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 from $4.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and increased 2.7% to $12.6 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 from $12.3 billion for the first nine months of 2014. sg&a for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 included $20 million and $119 million, respectively, of pretax net expenses related to the data breach. sg&a for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 included $28 million of pretax net expenses related to the data breach. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 19.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 19.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. for the first nine months of fiscal 2015, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 18.7% compared to 19.2% for the same period last year. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 reflects strong expense controls and expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, partially offset by expenses related to the data breach.depreciation and amortization increased 3.2% to $423 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 from $410 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. for the first nine months of fiscal 2015, depreciation and amortization increased 2.0% to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion for the same period of fiscal 2014. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 2.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and was 1.9% for the first nine months of both fiscal 2015 and 2014. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.operating income increased 16.8% to $3.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 from $2.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. operating income increased 11.4% to $9.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 from $8.3 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2014. for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recognized $240 million of interest and other, net, compared to $113 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. we recognized $517 million of interest and other, net, for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared to $395 million for the same period last year. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 0.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.8% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared to 0.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2014. these results reflect a $144 million pretax gain in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply compared to pretax gains of $100 million and $212 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014, 20table of contentsrespectively, related to the sales of portions of our equity ownership in hd supply. this was partially offset by additional interest expense incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 primarily due to long-term debt issued in june 2014, may 2015 and september 2015.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared to 37.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2014. the effective income tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 reflects a $71 million net benefit to our provision for income taxes due primarily to the favorable settlement of a tax audit.diluted earnings per share were $1.35 and $4.29 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively, compared to $1.15 and $3.66 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014, respectively. the gains on the sales of our equity ownership of hd supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared to a benefit of $0.10 for the first nine months of fiscal 2014, of which $0.05 was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. expenses related to the data breach had negative impacts of $0.01 and $0.06 to diluted earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively, compared to a negative impact of $0.01 for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014. diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 also reflect $0.05 of benefit from the favorable settlement of a tax audit.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. during the first nine months of fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.4 billion compared to $6.2 billion for the same period in fiscal 2014. this increase was primarily due to a $572 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage and a $519 million increase in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses related to increased purchases and the timing of payments, as well as expenses accrued related to the data breach.net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was $2.6 billion compared to $767 million for the same period in fiscal 2014. this change was primarily due to the acquisition of interline. the aggregate purchase price of this acquisition was $1.7 billion, of which a portion was used for the repayment of substantially all of interline's existing indebtedness. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was $3.4 billion compared to $5.2 billion for the same period of fiscal 2014. this change was primarily the result of $2.0 billion more of net proceeds from long-term borrowings and $535 million less in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $375 million more in cash dividends paid to stockholders and $290 million in repayments of short-term borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared to the same period of fiscal 2014.in september 2015, we issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due september 15, 2017 (the "2017 notes") and $1.0 billion of 3.35% senior notes due september 15, 2025 (the "2025 notes") at a discount of $1 million (together, the "september 2015 issuance"). the 2017 notes bear interest at a variable rate determined quarterly equal to the three-month libor rate plus 37 basis points. interest on the 2017 notes is due quarterly on march 15, june

the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $850 million asr agreement was determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock over the term of

stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.5 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of 12.0 million shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. the transaction was

2015, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.375 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.375 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of 10.1 million shares in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.375 billion asr agreement will be determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in december 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. at november 1, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. during the first nine months of fiscal 2015, all of our short-term borrowings were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was $720 million. as of november 1, 2015, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion, accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of issuing long-term debt to refinance debt maturing in fiscal 2016. as of november 1, 2015, we had $3.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, obligations incurred as a result of the data breach and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. recent accounting pronouncementsin april 2015, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update no. 2015-03, "interest – imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs" ("asu no. 2015-03"), which requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this asu. this guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015 and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, and retrospective application is required. we do not believe that asu no. 2015-03 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.in august 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2015-15, "interest – imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements" ("asu no. 2015-15"), which states that asu no. 2015-03 does not address debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements, and therefore the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting these related debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. we do not believe that asu no. 2015-15 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.22table of contents
