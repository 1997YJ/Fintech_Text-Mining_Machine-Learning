references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and financing
segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after excluding
amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of third quarter 2017 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
third quarter 2017 earnings of $4 billion, or $0.93 per diluted share,
compared with $2.7 billion a year earlier, as commodity prices improved
and performance in the upstream and downstream strengthened.



 


 


 



 
earnings
of $11.3 billion for the first nine months of 2017 increased 84 percent
from $6.2 billion in 2016.
 
earnings
per share assuming dilution were $2.66.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $14.1 billion, down 3 percent from
2016.
 
oil‑equivalent
production was 4 million barrels per day, down 1 percent from the
prior year. excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil‑equivalent
production was up 1 percent from the prior year.
 
the
corporation distributed $9.7 billion in dividends to shareholders.

upstream
earnings were $1,567 million in the third quarter of 2017, up $947 million
from the third quarter of 2016. higher liquids and gas realizations increased
earnings by $860 million. higher volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$20 million. all other items increased earnings by $70 million as lower
expenses were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
 
on
an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 2 percent from the third
quarter of 2016. liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day,
up 69,000 barrels per day as lower downtime and higher project volumes
were partly offset by field decline. natural gas production was 9.6 billion
cubic feet per day, down 16 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as field
decline and lower demand were partly offset by project ramp‑up, primarily
in australia, and work programs.
 
u.s.
upstream results were a loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2017,
compared to a loss of $477 million in the third quarter of 2016. non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $1,805 million, up $708 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings were $5,003 million in the first nine months of 2017, up
$4,165 million from 2016. higher realizations increased earnings by
$4.1 billion. unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by
$300 million. all other items increased earnings by $380 million,
primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by unfavorable tax items in the
current year.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was
down 1 percent compared to 2016. liquids production of 2.3 million barrels
per day decreased 65,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower
entitlements were partly offset by increased project volumes and work programs.
natural gas production of 10.1 billion cubic feet per day increased 106 million
cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp‑up, primarily in australia,
was partly offset by field decline.
 
u.s.
upstream results were a loss of $439 million in 2017, compared to a loss
of $1,823 million in 2016. non‑u.s. upstream earnings were
$5,442 million, up $2,781 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

downstream
earnings were $1,532 million, up $303 million from the third quarter
of 2016. higher refining margins increased earnings by $1 billion. volume
and mix effects decreased earnings by $160 million. all other items
decreased earnings by $550 million, reflecting the absence of favorable
asset management gains of $380 million in the prior year from the sale of
canadian retail assets and higher expenses related to hurricane harvey.
petroleum product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 43,000 barrels
per day lower than last year’s third quarter.
 
earnings
from the u.s. downstream were $391 million, up $166 million from the
third quarter of 2016. non‑u.s. downstream earnings of
$1,141 million were $137 million higher than prior year. 



 


 


 



 
downstream
earnings of $4,033 million in the first nine months of 2017 increased $1,073 million
from 2016. stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by
$1.3 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$110 million. all other items decreased earnings by $290 million, mainly
reflecting the absence of the canadian retail assets sale. petroleum product
sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 26,000 barrels per day higher
than 2016. 
 
u.s.
downstream earnings were $1,030 million, an increase of $206 million
from 2016. non‑u.s. downstream earnings were $3,003 million, up $867 million

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2017 was $8.4 billion,
including asset sales of $0.9 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $22.7 billion for the first nine months of 2017, $8.0
billion higher than 2016. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $11.4 billion, an increase of $5.1 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the non-cash provision of $14.1 billion
for depreciation and depletion decreased by $0.1 billion. changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2017 versus
a reduction of $2.4 billion in 2016. all other items net decreased cash flows
by $2.3 billion in 2017 compared to a reduction of $3.5 billion in 2016. see
the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for additional details. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2017 used net cash of $9.2 billion, a decrease of $1.5
billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property, plant
and equipment of $10.9 billion was $1.4 billion lower than 2016. proceeds from
asset sales of $1.7 billion decreased $0.5 billion. additional investments and
advances were $2.0 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion, and principally reflect
the deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration
payable as a result of the acquisition of interoil corporation. other investing
activities including collection of advances increased cash flows by $2.0
billion, including the return of unused contingent consideration from the
interoil acquisition escrow, and were up $1.2 billion from the previous year.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2017 was $24.4 billion,
including asset sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $13.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017, an
increase of $10.7 billion from 2016 mainly reflecting the absence of the
corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion in long-term debt in the prior year. 
 
during the first nine
months of 2017, exxon mobil corporation purchased 6 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.5 billion. these purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding increased
from 4,148 million at year-end to 4,237 million at the end of the third quarter
of 2017, mainly due to shares issued for the acquisitions of interoil
corporation and of companies that hold acreage in the permian basin. purchases
may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $3.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter of
2017 through dividends. 
 


20 



 

total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2017 compared to
$5.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2016.
 
total debt at the end
of the third quarter of 2017 was $40.6 billion compared to $42.8 billion at
year-end 2016. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 17.7 percent
at the end of the third quarter of 2017 compared to 19.7 percent at year-end
2016.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial
requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $14.8 billion for the third
quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.0 billion from 2016. income tax expense
increased by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 33 percent compared to 20 percent in the prior
year period reflecting the effect of one-time tax items and a higher share of
earnings in high tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes
and all other taxes and duties increased by $0.8 billion to $13.3 billion as a
result of higher sales realizations.



 


 


 



 
income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $42.6 billion for the first
nine months of 2017, an increase of $4.8 billion from 2016. income tax expense
increased by $3.2 billion to $4.2 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 34 percent compared to 26 percent in the prior
year period due a higher share of earnings in high tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties increased by
$1.6 billion to $38.4 billion as a result of higher sales realizations.
 
in the united states, the
corporation has various ongoing u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with
the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. the corporation
has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not
expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has
filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court
with respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution
of all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse
effect on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

capital and exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2017
were $6 billion, including the jurong aromatics plant acquisition.



 


 


 



 
capital and
exploration expenditures in the first nine months of 2017
were $14.1 billion, down 3 percent from the first nine months of 2016 due
primarily to lower upstream major project spending partially offset by the
jurong aromatics plant acquisition. the corporation anticipates an investment
level of $22 billion in 2017. actual spending could vary depending on the
progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. 
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.
see part ii. other information, item 1. legal proceedings in this report for
information concerning a civil penalty assessment related to this matter which
the corporation is contesting.
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. “sales and other operating
revenue” on the consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the
standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third
parties. this change in reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation
expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method, under
which prior years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on
the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018 results. the corporation
continues to evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to
have a material effect on the corporation’s financial statements.
 
in january 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued an updated standard, financial
instruments—overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial
assets and financial liabilities. the standard requires investments
in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method
investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value
recognized through net income. companies can elect a modified approach for
equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value. exxonmobil
is evaluating the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements and plans to adopt it in 2018. 
 
in march 2017, the financial accounting
standards board issued an accounting standards update, compensation –
retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic
pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the update
requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the
same line of the income statement as other compensation costs and the other
components of net benefit costs (non-service costs) to be presented separately
from the service cost component. additionally, only the service cost component
of net benefit costs will be eligible for capitalization. the update is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. the corporation expects to
add a new line “non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense” to its
consolidated statement of income. this line would reflect the non-service costs
that were previously included in “production and manufacturing expenses” and
“selling, general and administrative expenses”. the update is not expected to
have a material impact on the corporation’s financial statements. beginning
january 1, 2018, the corporation expects to include all of the
non-service costs in its corporate and financing segment.
 
in february 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, leases. the standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard
and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements and plans to adopt it
in 2019.

 critical accounting estimates
 
as part of its annual
planning and budgeting cycle which is completed in the fourth quarter each
year, the corporation develops crude and natural gas price outlooks as well as
estimates of future costs and other factors necessary to complete its plan. management’s
price outlook and other factors, including factors such as operating costs,
resource productivity, and capital efficiency, are re-assessed when facts and
circumstances warrant but no less often than annually. to the extent any
impairment testing may be required, management uses assumptions that are
reasonable in relation to these factors in developing estimates of future cash
flows. an asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows
were less than the asset’s carrying value, and impairment would be measured by
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. development of
future undiscounted cash flow estimates requires significant management
judgment, particularly in cases where an asset’s life is expected to extend
decades into the future, and an important component of the estimate is
management’s outlook on prices and other factors as noted above.
 
the corporation has
identified emerging trends such as increasing estimates of available natural
gas supplies and ongoing reductions in costs of supply for natural gas. in the
fourth quarter of 2017, the corporation will incorporate the impacts of these
trends and the resulting lower price outlook in its annual planning and
budgeting cycle. once complete, the corporation expects to perform an
impairment assessment for its north american natural gas asset groups utilizing
the information developed as part of the planning and budgeting process. it is
not practicable at this time to estimate the impact these trends would have on
the undiscounted cash flows for individual asset groups or any resulting
impairment charges. however these trends are likely to place the corporation’s
north american natural gas asset groups at risk for potential impairment. the
corporation will complete its analysis of relevant factors as discussed above
and perform any necessary impairment testing in connection with the preparation
of the corporation’s year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2017
form 10-k.
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. future results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; efficiency gains; capital and exploration expenditures; production
rates; resource recoveries; the impact of new technologies; potential
impairment charges; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to
factors including: changes in oil, gas or petrochemical prices or other market
or economic conditions affecting the oil, gas or petrochemical industries,
including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome of
exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government regulation,
including tax and environmental requirements; the impact of fiscal and
commercial terms and outcome of commercial negotiations; the results of
research programs; changes in technical or operating conditions; actions of
competitors; and other factors discussed under the heading “factors affecting
future results” in the “investors” section of our website and in item 1a of
exxonmobil's 2016 form 10-k. we assume no duty to update these statements
as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment

earnings were $1,567 million in the third quarter of 2017, up $947 million
from the third quarter of 2016. higher liquids and gas realizations increased
earnings by $860 million. higher volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$20 million. all other items increased earnings by $70 million as lower
expenses were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
 
on
an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 2 percent from the third
quarter of 2016. liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day,
up 69,000 barrels per day as lower downtime and higher project volumes
were partly offset by field decline. natural gas production was 9.6 billion
cubic feet per day, down 16 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as field
decline and lower demand were partly offset by project ramp‑up, primarily
in australia, and work programs.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2017 was $8.4 billion,
including asset sales of $0.9 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $22.7 billion for the first nine months of 2017, $8.0
billion higher than 2016. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $11.4 billion, an increase of $5.1 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the non-cash provision of $14.1 billion
for depreciation and depletion decreased by $0.1 billion. changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2017 versus
a reduction of $2.4 billion in 2016. all other items net decreased cash flows
by $2.3 billion in 2017 compared to a reduction of $3.5 billion in 2016. see
the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for additional details. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2017 used net cash of $9.2 billion, a decrease of $1.5
billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property, plant
and equipment of $10.9 billion was $1.4 billion lower than 2016. proceeds from
asset sales of $1.7 billion decreased $0.5 billion. additional investments and
advances were $2.0 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion, and principally reflect
the deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration
payable as a result of the acquisition of interoil corporation. other investing
activities including collection of advances increased cash flows by $2.0
billion, including the return of unused contingent consideration from the
interoil acquisition escrow, and were up $1.2 billion from the previous year.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2017 was $24.4 billion,
including asset sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $13.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017, an
increase of $10.7 billion from 2016 mainly reflecting the absence of the
corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion in long-term debt in the prior year. 
 
during the first nine
months of 2017, exxon mobil corporation purchased 6 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.5 billion. these purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding increased
from 4,148 million at year-end to 4,237 million at the end of the third quarter
of 2017, mainly due to shares issued for the acquisitions of interoil
corporation and of companies that hold acreage in the permian basin. purchases
may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $3.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter of
2017 through dividends.

opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.

income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $14.8 billion for the third
quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.0 billion from 2016. income tax expense
increased by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 33 percent compared to 20 percent in the prior
year period reflecting the effect of one-time tax items and a higher share of
earnings in high tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes
and all other taxes and duties increased by $0.8 billion to $13.3 billion as a
result of higher sales realizations.



 


 


 



 
income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $42.6 billion for the first
nine months of 2017, an increase of $4.8 billion from 2016. income tax expense
increased by $3.2 billion to $4.2 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 34 percent compared to 26 percent in the prior
year period due a higher share of earnings in high tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties increased by
$1.6 billion to $38.4 billion as a result of higher sales realizations.
 
in the united states, the
corporation has various ongoing u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with
the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. the corporation
has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not
expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has
filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court
with respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution
of all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse
effect on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

capital and exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2017
were $6 billion, including the jurong aromatics plant acquisition.



 


 


 



 
capital and
exploration expenditures in the first nine months of 2017
were $14.1 billion, down 3 percent from the first nine months of 2016 due
primarily to lower upstream major project spending partially offset by the
jurong aromatics plant acquisition. the corporation anticipates an investment
level of $22 billion in 2017. actual spending could vary depending on the
progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. 
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.
see part ii. other information, item 1. legal proceedings in this report for
information concerning a civil penalty assessment related to this matter which
the corporation is contesting.
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. “sales and other operating
revenue” on the consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the
standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third
parties. this change in reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation
expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method, under
which prior years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on
the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018 results. the corporation
continues to evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to
have a material effect on the corporation’s financial statements.
 
in january 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued an updated standard, financial
instruments—overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial
assets and financial liabilities. the standard requires investments
in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method
investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value
recognized through net income. companies can elect a modified approach for
equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value. exxonmobil
is evaluating the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements and plans to adopt it in 2018. 
 
in march 2017, the financial accounting
standards board issued an accounting standards update, compensation –
retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic
pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the update
requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the
same line of the income statement as other compensation costs and the other
components of net benefit costs (non-service costs) to be presented separately
from the service cost component. additionally, only the service cost component
of net benefit costs will be eligible for capitalization. the update is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. the corporation expects to
add a new line “non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense” to its
consolidated statement of income. this line would reflect the non-service costs
that were previously included in “production and manufacturing expenses” and
“selling, general and administrative expenses”. the update is not expected to
have a material impact on the corporation’s financial statements. beginning
january 1, 2018, the corporation expects to include all of the
non-service costs in its corporate and financing segment.
 
in february 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, leases. the standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard
and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements and plans to adopt it
in 2019.

 critical accounting estimates
 
as part of its annual
planning and budgeting cycle which is completed in the fourth quarter each
year, the corporation develops crude and natural gas price outlooks as well as
estimates of future costs and other factors necessary to complete its plan. management’s
price outlook and other factors, including factors such as operating costs,
resource productivity, and capital efficiency, are re-assessed when facts and
circumstances warrant but no less often than annually. to the extent any
impairment testing may be required, management uses assumptions that are
reasonable in relation to these factors in developing estimates of future cash
flows. an asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows
were less than the asset’s carrying value, and impairment would be measured by
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. development of
future undiscounted cash flow estimates requires significant management
judgment, particularly in cases where an asset’s life is expected to extend
decades into the future, and an important component of the estimate is
management’s outlook on prices and other factors as noted above.
 
the corporation has
identified emerging trends such as increasing estimates of available natural
gas supplies and ongoing reductions in costs of supply for natural gas. in the
fourth quarter of 2017, the corporation will incorporate the impacts of these
trends and the resulting lower price outlook in its annual planning and
budgeting cycle. once complete, the corporation expects to perform an
impairment assessment for its north american natural gas asset groups utilizing
the information developed as part of the planning and budgeting process. it is
not practicable at this time to estimate the impact these trends would have on
the undiscounted cash flows for individual asset groups or any resulting
impairment charges. however these trends are likely to place the corporation’s
north american natural gas asset groups at risk for potential impairment. the
corporation will complete its analysis of relevant factors as discussed above
and perform any necessary impairment testing in connection with the preparation
of the corporation’s year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2017
form 10-k.
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. future results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; efficiency gains; capital and exploration expenditures; production
rates; resource recoveries; the impact of new technologies; potential
impairment charges; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to
factors including: changes in oil, gas or petrochemical prices or other market
or economic conditions affecting the oil, gas or petrochemical industries,
including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome of
exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government regulation,
including tax and environmental requirements; the impact of fiscal and
commercial terms and outcome of commercial negotiations; the results of
research programs; changes in technical or operating conditions; actions of
competitors; and other factors discussed under the heading “factors affecting
future results” in the “investors” section of our website and in item 1a of
exxonmobil's 2016 form 10-k. we assume no duty to update these statements
as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
