review of first quarter 2013 results 
 
exxonmobil achieved strong results
during the first quarter of 2013, while investing significantly to develop new
energy supplies.  exxonmobil’s financial performance enables continued investment
to deliver the energy needed to help meet growing demand, support economic
growth, and raise living standards around the world.
 
first quarter
2013 earnings were $9.5 billion, up 1 percent from the first quarter of 2012.
 
capital and
exploration expenditures for the first quarter were $11.8 billion, including
$3.1 billion for the acquisition of celtic exploration ltd. 
 
the
corporation distributed $7.6 billion to shareholders in the first quarter
through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

upstream earnings for the first
three months were $7,037 million, down $765 million from the first quarter of
2012.  lower liquids realizations, partially offset by improved natural gas
realizations, decreased earnings by $230 million.  production volume and
mix effects reduced earnings by $280 million.  all other items, including
higher operating expenses, decreased earnings by $250 million.

on an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 3.5
percent from the first quarter of 2012.  excluding the impacts of entitlement
volumes, opec quota effects and divestments, production decreased 1.2 percent.
 
liquids
production totaled 2,193 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 21 kbd
from the first quarter of 2012 as field decline was partially offset by project
ramp-up in west africa.  the net impact of entitlement volumes, opec quota
effects, and divestments was negligible.
 
first quarter
natural gas production was 13,213 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day),
down 823 mcfd from 2012.  excluding the impacts of entitlement volumes and
divestments, natural gas production was down 1.5 percent, as field decline was
partially offset by lower downtime and higher demand.
 
earnings from
u.s. upstream operations were $859 million, $151 million lower than
the first quarter of 2012.  non-u.s. upstream earnings were $6,178 million, down $614 million
from the prior year.

for the first three months, downstream
earnings were $1,545 million, down $41 million from the first quarter of 2012. 
stronger margins, mainly in refining, increased earnings by $780 million. 
volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $290 million.  all other items,
including lower gains on asset sales, higher expenses, and foreign exchange
effects, decreased earnings by $530 million.  petroleum product sales of 5,755
kbd were 561 kbd lower than last year's first quarter reflecting the japan
restructuring and other divestment related impacts.
 
earnings from
the u.s. downstream were $1,039 million, up $436 million from the first quarter
of 2012.  non-u.s. downstream earnings of $506 million were $477 million lower

because of the ongoing nature of
our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful for
investors to consider asset sales proceeds together with cash provided by
operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the
business and financing activities.
  
total cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 billion at the
end of the first quarter of 2013 compared to $19.1 billion at the end of the first
quarter of 2012.
 
cash provided by operating activities totaled $13.6
billion for the first three months of 2013, $5.7 billion lower than 2012. the
major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $9.8
billion which was flat with the prior year period.  the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $4.1 billion for depreciation and depletion increased by
$0.3 billion.  changes in operational working capital added to cash flows in
both periods.  all other items net in 2013 decreased cash by $2.6 billion.  for
additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on
page 6. 
 
investing activities for the first three months of
2013 used net cash of $10.1 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion compared to
the prior year.  spending for additions to property, plant and equipment decreased
$0.3 billion to $7.5 billion.  proceeds from asset sales of $0.4 billion, decreased
$2.2 billion.  additional investment and advances increased $2.9 billion to
$3.0 billion reflecting the impact of the acquisition of celtic exploration ltd.
 
cash flow from operations and asset sales in the first
quarter of 2013 of $14.0 billion, including asset sales of $0.4 billion,
decreased $7.8 billion from the comparable 2012 period.  
 
net cash used in financing activities of $6.7 billion
in the first three months of 2013 was $1.4 lower than 2012, reflecting short-term
debt issuance in 2013.  
 
during the first quarter of 2013, exxon mobil
corporation purchased 63 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at
a gross cost of $5.6 billion.  these purchases included $5 billion to reduce
the number of shares outstanding with the balance used to acquire shares in
conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs.  shares outstanding
decreased from 4,502 million at year-end 2012 to 4,446 million at the end of
the first quarter 2013.  purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued
at any time without prior notice.


-16-
 

 

 
 

 
the
corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $7.6 billion in the first
quarter of 2013 through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares
outstanding.
 
total debt of
$13.4 billion compared to $11.6 billion at year-end 2012.  the corporation's
debt to total capital ratio was 7.2 percent at the end of the first quarter of
2013 compared to 6.3 percent at year-end 2012.  
 
although the corporation issues long-term debt from time to time and
maintains a revolving commercial paper program, internally generated funds are
expected to cover the majority of its net near-term financial requirements. 
 
the corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program,
continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.  because of the
ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time
to time which will result in either gains or losses.  additionally, the
corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio
through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions
from time to time.  key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include potential
for future growth and attractive current valuations.  acquisitions may be made
with cash, shares of the corporation’s common stock, or both.  
 
litigation and
other contingencies are discussed in note 2 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.

forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements.  actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "factors
affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our website and in
item 1a of exxonmobil's 2012 form 10-k.  we assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.
 
the term “project” as used in this report does not
necessarily have the same meaning as under sec rule 13q-1 relating to government
payment reporting.  for example, a single project for purposes of the rule may
encompass numerous properties, agreements, investments, developments, phases,
work efforts, activities, and components, each of which we may also informally
describe as a “project”.

because of the ongoing nature of

investors to consider asset sales proceeds together with cash provided by
operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the
business and financing activities.
  
total cash and cash equivalents of $6.6 billion at the
end of the first quarter of 2013 compared to $19.1 billion at the end of the first
quarter of 2012.
 
cash provided by operating activities totaled $13.6

forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements.  actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "factors
affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our website and in
item 1a of exxonmobil's 2012 form 10-k.  we assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.
 
the term “project” as used in this report does not
necessarily have the same meaning as under sec rule 13q-1 relating to government
payment reporting.  for example, a single project for purposes of the rule may
encompass numerous properties, agreements, investments, developments, phases,
work efforts, activities, and components, each of which we may also informally
describe as a “project”.
