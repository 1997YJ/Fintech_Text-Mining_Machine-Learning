review of first quarter 2016 results 
 
exxonmobil’s first
quarter 2016 earnings were $1.8 billion, or $0.43 per diluted
share, compared with $4.9 billion a year earlier. lower upstream and
downstream earnings were partially offset by stronger chemical results and
lower corporate costs.
 
the organization
continues to respond effectively to challenging industry conditions, capturing
enhancements to operational performance and creating margin uplift despite low
prices. the scale and integrated nature of our cash flow provide competitive
advantage and support consistent strategy execution.
 
new project capacity
additions drove liquids production up 11.5 percent in the quarter, or 261,000
barrels per day. total upstream volumes increased to 4.3 million oil-equivalent
barrels per day.

upstream earnings
declined $2,931 million from the first quarter of 2015, to a loss of $76
million. lower liquids and gas realizations decreased earnings by
$2.6 billion. sales mix effects decreased earnings by $100 million.
all other items decreased earnings by $250 million, including lower gains
on asset sales and less favorable tax items partly offset by lower expenses.

on an oil-equivalent basis, production increased 1.8 percent
from the first quarter of 2015. liquids production totaled 2.5 million
barrels per day, up 261,000 barrels per day, while natural gas production
was 10.7 billion cubic feet per day, down 1.1 billion cubic feet per
day from 2015. project ramp‑up was partly offset by regulatory
restrictions in the netherlands, field decline and asset management impacts.
 
the u.s. upstream
operations recorded a loss of $832 million, compared to a loss of
$52 million in the first quarter of 2015. non-u.s. upstream earnings were
$756 million, down $2,151 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $4.8 billion for the first three months of 2016,
$3.2 billion lower than 2015. net income including noncontrolling interests was
$1.8 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the prior year period. the
adjustment for the noncash provision of $4.8 billion for depreciation and
depletion increased by $0.5 billion. changes in operational working capital
decreased cash flows by $0.4 billion in 2016 and $0.5 billion in 2015. all
other items net decreased cash by $1.3 billion in 2016 and $0.9 billion in
2015. for additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of cash
flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first three months of 2016 used net cash of $4.3 billion, a decrease of
$2.0 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $4.6 billion was $2.2 billion lower than 2015. proceeds
from asset sales of $0.2 billion decreased $0.3 billion. other investing
activities – net were unchanged at $0.3 billion.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2016 was $5.0 billion,
including asset sales of $0.2 billion, and decreased $3.5 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
during the first
quarter of 2016, the corporation issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt and
used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. the net cash generated by
financing activities was $0.5 billion in the first three months of 2016, $1.4
billion higher than 2015 reflecting lower purchases of exxonmobil stock in
2016.
  
during the first
quarter of 2016, exxon mobil corporation purchased 9 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.7 billion. these purchases
were made to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and
programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,156 million at year-end to 4,147
million at the end of the first quarter 2016. purchases may be made in both the
open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed to shareholders a total of $3.1 billion in the first quarter of
2016 through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016 compared to
$5.2 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2015.
  


18  



 

total debt of $43.1 billion compared to $38.7 billion at year-end
2015. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 19.5 percent at the end
of the first quarter of 2016 compared to 18.0 percent at year-end 2015.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income, sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled
$11.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of $2.9 billion from
2015. income tax decreased by $1.6 billion and was a credit of $51 million
reflecting lower earnings, including a loss in the united states. the effective
income tax rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes
and exxonmobil share of equity company income taxes, was 19 percent compared to
33 percent in the prior year period due to a
higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, the loss in the united
states, and favorable one-time tax items. sales-based
taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by $1.3 billion to $11.5 billion
as a result of lower sales realizations.
 
in the united states,
the corporation has various u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with the
internal revenue service (irs) for tax years 2006-2011. for tax years
2010-2011, the irs has asserted a penalty associated with several of those
positions. the corporation has not recognized the penalty as an expense
because, in the corporation’s judgment, the irs should not be able to sustain
the penalty under applicable law. the same u.s. federal income tax positions
are at issue for tax years 2006-2009 and also could be subject to the assertion
of a penalty. unfavorable resolution of these issues would not have a
materially adverse effect on the corporation’s net income or liquidity. the irs
has not completed its audit of tax years after 2011.

anticipates an investment level of $23.2 billion in 2016. actual spending could
vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property
acquisitions.

in 2014, the european union and united states imposed
sanctions relating to the russian energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply
with all sanctions and regulatory licenses applicable to its affiliates’
investments in the russian federation. 
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, revenue from contracts with customers.
the standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. the standard is required to be adopted beginning
january 1, 2018. 
 
“sales and other operating revenue” on the
consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes
on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard, revenue will
exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. this change in
reporting will not impact earnings.
 
the corporation continues to evaluate
other areas of the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements. 
 
in february 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, leases. the standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. the standard is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2019. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource
recoveries; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors
including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of
economic recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts;
changes in law or government regulation, including tax and environmental
requirements; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; changes in technical
or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading
"factors affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our
website and in item 1a of exxonmobil's 2015 form 10-k. we assume no duty
to update these statements as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.

countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $4.8 billion for the first three months of 2016,
$3.2 billion lower than 2015. net income including noncontrolling interests was
$1.8 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the prior year period. the
adjustment for the noncash provision of $4.8 billion for depreciation and
depletion increased by $0.5 billion. changes in operational working capital
decreased cash flows by $0.4 billion in 2016 and $0.5 billion in 2015. all
other items net decreased cash by $1.3 billion in 2016 and $0.9 billion in
2015. for additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of cash
flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first three months of 2016 used net cash of $4.3 billion, a decrease of
$2.0 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $4.6 billion was $2.2 billion lower than 2015. proceeds
from asset sales of $0.2 billion decreased $0.3 billion. other investing
activities – net were unchanged at $0.3 billion.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2016 was $5.0 billion,
including asset sales of $0.2 billion, and decreased $3.5 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
during the first
quarter of 2016, the corporation issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt and
used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. the net cash generated by
financing activities was $0.5 billion in the first three months of 2016, $1.4
billion higher than 2015 reflecting lower purchases of exxonmobil stock in
2016.
  
during the first
quarter of 2016, exxon mobil corporation purchased 9 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.7 billion. these purchases
were made to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and
programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,156 million at year-end to 4,147
million at the end of the first quarter 2016. purchases may be made in both the
open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed to shareholders a total of $3.1 billion in the first quarter of
2016 through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016 compared to
$5.2 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2015.

total debt of $43.1 billion compared to $38.7 billion at year-end
2015. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 19.5 percent at the end
of the first quarter of 2016 compared to 18.0 percent at year-end 2015.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income, sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled
$11.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of $2.9 billion from
2015. income tax decreased by $1.6 billion and was a credit of $51 million
reflecting lower earnings, including a loss in the united states. the effective
income tax rate, which is calculated based on consolidated company income taxes
and exxonmobil share of equity company income taxes, was 19 percent compared to
33 percent in the prior year period due to a
higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, the loss in the united
states, and favorable one-time tax items. sales-based
taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by $1.3 billion to $11.5 billion
as a result of lower sales realizations.
 
in the united states,
the corporation has various u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with the
internal revenue service (irs) for tax years 2006-2011. for tax years
2010-2011, the irs has asserted a penalty associated with several of those
positions. the corporation has not recognized the penalty as an expense
because, in the corporation’s judgment, the irs should not be able to sustain
the penalty under applicable law. the same u.s. federal income tax positions
are at issue for tax years 2006-2009 and also could be subject to the assertion
of a penalty. unfavorable resolution of these issues would not have a
materially adverse effect on the corporation’s net income or liquidity. the irs
has not completed its audit of tax years after 2011.

anticipates an investment level of $23.2 billion in 2016. actual spending could
vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property

in 2014, the european union and united states imposed
sanctions relating to the russian energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply
with all sanctions and regulatory licenses applicable to its affiliates’
investments in the russian federation. 
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, revenue from contracts with customers.
the standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. the standard is required to be adopted beginning
january 1, 2018. 
 
“sales and other operating revenue” on the
consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes
on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard, revenue will
exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. this change in
reporting will not impact earnings.
 
the corporation continues to evaluate
other areas of the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements. 
 
in february 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, leases. the standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. the standard is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2019. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource
recoveries; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors
including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of
economic recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts;
changes in law or government regulation, including tax and environmental
requirements; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; changes in technical
or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading
"factors affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our
website and in item 1a of exxonmobil's 2015 form 10-k. we assume no duty
to update these statements as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
