overview

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital economy. our primary component-level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash
memory.

net revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), and net income (loss) for the first and second
quarters of 2009 and the second quarter of 2008 were as follows:

our second quarter results were better than expected. in anticipation of a seasonally up second
half, the supply chain began refilling inventory positions that had been depleted over the past two
quarters. as a result, revenue was up 12% sequentially on higher microprocessor and chipset
revenue. revenue from intel® atomtm processors and chipsets also
significantly increased sequentially. compared to q2 2008, revenue was down 15%, an improvement
from the 26% year over year decline we saw in the first quarter of 2009. while this may signal
increased market confidence, we believe the global economic environment remains volatile, creating
an uncertain demand environment.

our overall gross margin dollars for the second quarter of 2009 were up 26% compared to the first
quarter of 2009, and down 22% compared to the second quarter of 2008. our overall gross margin
percentage for the second quarter of 2009 was higher than our outlook at 50.8%, compared to 45.3%
in the first quarter of 2009 and 55.4% in the second quarter of 2008. compared to the first quarter
of 2009, higher microprocessor sales volume and reductions in factory underutilization charges
positively impacted our gross margin while higher start-up costs associated with our new 32nm
process technology and lower average selling prices on microprocessors negatively impacted our
gross margin. we expect reductions in both factory underutilization charges and start-up costs in
the third quarter to positively impact our gross margin, in addition to anticipated improvements we
expect in the microprocessor business with higher sales volumes and lower unit costs. we expect
these reductions in costs to be partially offset by inventory write-offs on our new 32nm
microprocessor products built prior to qualification for sale and lower microprocessor average
selling prices.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

despite
the company’s strong execution, we had a net loss  per common share for the quarter of $0.07, which
included the impact of the decision received from the european commission (ec) on may 13, 2009. we
recorded the full amount of the fine,
€1.06 billion
($1.447 billion), which reduced earnings per
 common share by $0.25. our tax provision for the quarter was
$348 million on negative pre-tax income as the
fine is not tax deductible. we disagree with the ec decision and have filed our appeal.

from a financial condition perspective, we were able to generate nearly $3.4 billion in cash from
operations and pay $784 million in dividends despite being in a net loss position for the quarter.
as of june 27, 2009, cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments
included in trading assets, and short-term investments totaled $11.3
billion and continued to be of high credit quality.
subsequent
to the end of the second quarter of 2009, we completed the acquisition of wind river systems
inc., a leading software vendor in embedded devices, in exchange for $884 million to be paid to the
stockholders of wind river. with this acquisition we expect to create a new class of differentiated
products for the embedded and handheld market segments.

strategy

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital economy. as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use
our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our
financial resources, global presence, and brand recognition. we believe that we have the scale,
capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly.

some of our key focus areas are listed below:




 
•
 
customer orientation. our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of
products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. in turn, our products help
enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and
consumers. we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured
to work together to provide an optimized user computing solution, compared to components
that are used separately.


 
•
 
architecture and platforms. we are developing integrated platform solutions by
moving the memory controller and graphics functionality from the chipset to the
microprocessor. this platform repartitioning is designed to provide improved performance
due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and reduced platform size. in addition,
we are focusing on improved energy-efficient performance for computing and communications
systems and devices. improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing improved
performance with lower power consumption. we continue to develop multi-core microprocessors
with an increasing number of cores, which enable improved multitasking and energy
efficiency.


 
•
 
silicon and manufacturing technology leadership. our strategy for developing
microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new
microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. we plan to introduce a
new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon
process technology in the intervening years. this coordinated schedule allows us to develop
and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for
the next generation of silicon process technology. we refer to this as our “tick-tock”
technology development cadence.


 
•
 
strategic investments. we make equity investments in companies around the world
that we believe will generate returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our
key business initiatives. our investments, including those made through our intel capital
program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in
the digital economy, create new business opportunities for intel, and expand global markets
for our products. our current investments focus on the following areas: advancing flash
memory products, enabling mobile wireless devices, advancing the digital home, enhancing
the digital enterprise, advancing high-performance communications infrastructures, and
developing the next generation of silicon process technologies. our focus areas and
investment activities tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in
technology and changes in the economic climate.


 
•
 
business environment and software. we believe that we are well positioned in
the technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote
industry standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. we plan
to continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer
products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. we frequently
participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical
specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by
standards-setting organizations. in addition, we work collaboratively with other companies
to protect digital content and the consumer. through our software and services group (ssg),
we help enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and
support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that
take advantage of our platforms. through wind river,  which we acquired in the
third quarter of 2009, we license software products and provide services that are optimized
for the needs of customers in the embedded and handheld market segments. we believe that
the software expertise of wind river in the embedded and handheld market segments will
expedite our growth strategy in these market segments.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we believe that the proliferation of the internet, including user demand for premium content and
rich media, drives the need for greater performance in pcs and servers. older pcs are increasingly
incapable of handling the tasks that users demand, such as streaming video, uploading photos, and
online gaming. as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power, we
believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet. we
also believe that increased internet traffic creates a need for greater server infrastructure,
including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance.

we believe the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor
units will continue. we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the
increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power
microprocessors. we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to
that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers, as a growing number of
households have multiple devices for different computing functions.
our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors
for these and other new uses and form factors. we believe that intel atom processors give us the ability to extend
intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including a growing number of products
that require processors specifically designed for embedded solutions, handheld solutions, consumer
electronics devices, nettops, and netbooks. we believe that the common elements for products in
these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the internet.

to meet the demands of new and evolving mobile markets segments and various embedded market
segments, we also offer, and are continuing to develop, system on chip (soc) products that
integrate core processing functionality with specific components, such as graphics, audio, and
video, onto a single chip to form a purpose-built solution. this integration reduces cost, power
consumption, and size. in the first quarter of 2009, we announced plans to collaborate with taiwan
semiconductor manufacturing company, ltd. (tsmc), a large semiconductor foundry, in an effort to
broaden the market opportunities for intel atom processors in soc products by integrating our intel
atom processor cores with tsmc’s process technology platform.

we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many-core architecture aimed at
parallel processing. this architecture will initially be used in developing discrete graphics
processors designed for gaming and media creation. over time, this architecture may be utilized in
the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as
high-performance computing applications.

strategy by operating segment

the strategy for our digital enterprise group (deg) is to offer computing and communications
products for businesses, service providers, and consumers. deg products are incorporated into
desktop and nettop computers, enterprise computer servers and workstations, and products that make
up the infrastructure for the internet. we also offer products for embedded designs, such as
industrial equipment, point-of-sale systems, telecommunications, panel pcs, in-vehicle
information/entertainment systems, and medical equipment. our strategy for the desktop computing
market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and
energy-efficient performance while at the same time lowering total cost of ownership for
businesses. for consumers in the desktop computing market segment, we also focus on the design of
components for high-end enthusiast pcs and mainstream pcs with rich audio and video capabilities.
our strategy for the nettop computing market segment is to offer products that enable affordable,
internet-focused devices with small form factors. our strategy for the enterprise computing market
segment is to offer products that provide energy-efficient performance and virtualization
technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. we are also increasing our focus on
products designed for high-performance computing, data centers, and blade server systems. our
strategy for the embedded computing market segment is to drive intel architecture as an embedded
solution by delivering long life cycle support, architectural scalability, and platform
integration.

the strategy for our mobility group is to offer notebook pc products designed to improve
performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of
smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. we are also increasing our focus on products designed
for the business and consumer environments by offering technologies that provide increased
manageability and security, and we continue to invest in the build-out of wimax. we also offer, and
are continuing to develop, products that enable mobile devices to deliver digital content and the
internet to users in new ways, including products for handhelds and netbooks.

the strategy for our nand solutions group is to offer advanced nand flash memory products, focusing
on system-level solutions for intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives.
additionally, we offer nand products used in memory cards. in support of our strategy to provide
advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development of innovative products
designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non-volatile, low-cost, high-density
memory.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

the strategy for our digital home group is to offer products and solutions, including soc designs,
for use in consumer electronics devices designed to access and share internet, broadcast, optical
media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home. we are
focusing on the design of components for consumer electronics devices, such as digital tvs,
high-definition media players, and set-top boxes, which receive, decode, and convert incoming data
signals.

the strategy for our digital health group is to design and deliver technology-enabled products and
explore global business opportunities in healthcare information technology and healthcare research,
as well as personal healthcare. in support of this strategy, we are focusing on the design of
technology solutions and platforms for the digital hospital and consumer/home health products. in
addition, we have formed an alliance with general electric company for the development of
consumer/home health products and to address demand for independent living and disease management
products.

the strategy for our software and services group is to promote intel architecture as the platform
of choice for software and services. ssg works with the worldwide software and services ecosystem
by providing software products, engaging with developers, and driving strategic software
investments.

critical accounting estimates

the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. some of our
accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the
need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical
accounting estimates include:




 
•
 
the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments,
net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;


 
•
 
the valuation of investments in debt instruments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact our investment portfolio balance when we
assess fair value, and interest and other, net when we record credit-related impairments of
available-for-sale debt instruments;


 
•
 
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which primarily impacts
gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their
depreciation;


 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including
the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and


 
•
 
the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin.



below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. we also
have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as those for revenue
recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors; however, these policies
typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

non-marketable equity investments

the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives,
totaled $3.7 billion as of june 27, 2009 ($4.1 billion as of december 27, 2008). the majority of
this balance as of june 27, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment.
our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies, llc
(imft) of $1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of december 27, 2008), our investment in im flash
singapore, llp (imfs) of $308 million ($329 million as of december 27, 2008), and our investment in
numonyx b.v. of $447 million ($484 million as of december 27, 2008). in addition, we regularly
invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage
companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with
established revenue streams and business models. for additional information, see “note 10: equity
method investments” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method
of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable
equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance
sheets.

39



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of the companies in which we
invest are likely to fail. their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance,
operational efficiency, and other key business factors. depending on their future prospects, the
companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive
lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our
investments would likely become impaired. additionally, the current financial markets are extremely
volatile and there has been a tightening of the credit markets, which could negatively affect the
prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the
likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as
initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. for further information about our investment
portfolio risks, see “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q.

we measure the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly in accordance with fsp
107-1/apb 28-1; however, the investments are only recorded at fair value when the investments are
impaired. the assessment of fair value for non-marketable investments is based on the provisions of
statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 157, “fair value measurements” (sfas no.
157).

for non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment
and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of events or circumstances identified that
impact the fair value of the investment, including:




 
•
 
the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones
and overall business prospects;


 
•
 
the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;


 
•
 
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area,
including adverse regulatory or economic changes;


 
•
 
factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the
investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash;
and


 
•
 
the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.



if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is
other than temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis as well as the
severity and duration of the impairment. if the investment is considered to be other than
temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. with the exception of
clearwire communications, llc (clearwire llc), the fair value of our non-marketable investments are
classified as level 3 when impaired, as we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology
that are significant to the fair value measurement, and the valuation requires management judgment
due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. if impaired, the fair
value of our investment in clearwire llc would be classified as level 2, as the unobservable inputs
to the valuation methodology are not significant to the fair value measurement.

impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $39 million in the second quarter of 2009
($118 million in the first half of 2009). over the past 12 quarters, including the second quarter
of 2009, impairments of non-marketable equity investments have ranged from $11 million to $896
million per quarter. this range includes impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of
2008, which were primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in
clearwire llc.

the following is a discussion of the methods, estimates, and judgments that management uses in our
analysis to determine if our non-marketable equity investments are other than temporarily impaired.

imft/imfs

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand
products to intel and micron technology, inc. at manufacturing cost. our nand solutions group
operating segment purchases 49% of these nand products from imft and sells them to our customers.
as a result, we generate cash flows from our investments in imft, imfs, and our intangible assets
related to the nand product designs through our nand solutions group business. therefore, we
determine the fair value of our investments in imft and imfs using the income approach, based on a
weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business.

the discounted cash flow scenarios require the use of unobservable inputs, including assumptions of
projected revenues (including product volume, product mix, and average selling prices), expenses,
capital spending, and other costs, as well as a discount rate. estimates of projected revenues,
expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by imft, imfs, and intel using historical
data and available market data. management also determines how multiple discounted cash flow
scenarios are weighted in the fair value determination. additionally, the development of several
inputs used in our income model (such as discount rate) requires the selection of comparable
companies within the nand flash memory market segment. the selection of comparable companies
requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including nand products and
services lines within the flash memory market segment, comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates,
and other relevant factors.

40



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs would change the fair value of the
investment. the estimates for the projected revenue and discount rate are the assumptions that most
significantly affect the fair value determination. we did not have an other-than-temporary
impairment on our investments in imft and imfs in the first half of 2009 or the first half of 2008.
it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in
the near term and result in an impairment of our investment.

numonyx

we determine the fair value of our investment in numonyx using a combination of the income approach
and the market approach. the income approach includes the use of a weighted average of multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios of numonyx, which requires the use of unobservable inputs, including
assumptions of projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs, as well as a
discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment. estimates of
projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by numonyx and intel.
the market approach includes using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies,
such as projected revenues, expenses, and other costs. the selection of comparable companies used
in the market approach requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including
nor products and services lines within the flash memory market segment, comparable companies’
sizes, growth rates, and other relevant factors.

changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs in our valuation models would change the
fair value of the investment. the estimated projected revenue is the assumption that most
significantly affects the fair value determination. management judgment is also involved in
determining how the income approach and the market approach are weighted in the fair value
determination. we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in numonyx in
the first half of 2009 or the first half of 2008. it is reasonably possible that the estimates used
in the fair value determination could change in the near term and result in an impairment of our
investment.

other non-marketable equity investments

we determine the fair value of these non-marketable equity investments using the market approach
and/or the income approach. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of
comparable public companies. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and
is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, products and
services lines, development stage, and other relevant factors. the income approach includes the use
of a discounted cash flow model, which requires the following significant estimates for the
investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; estimated
costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. estimates
of market segment size, market segment share, and costs are developed by the investee and/or intel
using historical data and available market data. the valuation of our other non-marketable
investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets, recent
financing activities by the investees, changes in the interest rate environment, the investee’s
capital structure, liquidation preferences for the investee’s capital, and other economic
variables.

investments in debt instruments

fair value

in the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be
difficult and subjective. rapid changes occurring in today’s financial markets can lead to changes
in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time. sfas no. 157
establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see “note 4: fair value”
in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q). each level of input
has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value.

level 1 instruments represent quoted prices in active markets. therefore, determining fair value
for level 1 instruments does not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not
difficult.

41



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for
identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active
markets), issuer credit ratings, non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with
observable market data, model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or
can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities, or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. these
level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level 1
instruments, including:




 
•
 
determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced
requires management to identify a sample of similar securities based on the coupon rates,
maturity, issuer, credit rating, and instrument type, and subjectively select an individual
security or multiple securities that are deemed most similar to the security being priced.


 
•
 
determining whether a market is considered active requires management judgment.
our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into
consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date
of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument
trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of
the issued instrument.


 
•
 
determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining fair value
requires management judgment. when observable market prices for identical securities or
similar securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using
non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data or
pricing models, such as discounted cash flow models, with all significant inputs derived
from or corroborated with observable market data.



level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant
to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. the determination of fair value for
level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. most of our marketable
debt instruments classified as level 3 are valued using a non-binding market consensus price or a
non-binding broker quote, both of which we corroborate with unobservable data. non-binding market
consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers.
these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker
quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and the internal
assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs, and to a lesser
degree non-observable market inputs. adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using
non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes, and classified as level 3, were
not significant in the second quarter of 2009.

other-than-temporary impairment

after determining the fair value of our available-for-sale debt instruments, gains or losses on
these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss), until either the investment is
sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. determining whether the
decline in fair value is other-than-temporary requires management judgment based on the specific
facts and circumstances of each investment. for investments in debt instruments, these judgments
primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer, the issuer’s credit rating,
and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and
be paid in full; if we have the intent to sell the investment; and if it is more likely than not
that we will be required to sell an investment that has unrealized losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) before we recover the amortized cost basis. given the current market
conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit
ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.

for available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and
that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of our amortized
cost basis, we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the
amount due to all other factors. the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the
difference between the debt instrument’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected
future cash flows. the remaining difference between the debt instrument’s fair value and the
present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is
recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).

as of june 27, 2009, our investments included $11.7 billion of available-for-sale debt instruments.
we have recognized less than $55 million of credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses
in earnings on our available-for-sale debt instruments cumulatively since the beginning of 2008. as
of june 27, 2009, our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as
available-for-sale were approximately $165 million (approximately $215 million as of december 27,
2008). as of june 27, 2009, this amount included approximately $110 million of unrecognized losses
that could be recognized in the future.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

long-lived assets

we assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. factors that we
consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of
a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic
trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. we measure the
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying
value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash
flows. if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted
cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is measured by
comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. the
assessment of fair value is based on the provisions of sfas no. 157. long-lived assets such as
goodwill; intangible assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets,
and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is
recognized.

impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of
identifiable independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of
our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the
independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective
judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor
manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the
assets’ new, shorter useful lives. over the past 12 quarters, including the second quarter of 2009,
impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $25 million to $320
million per quarter. for further discussion on asset impairment charges, see “note 16:
restructuring and asset impairment charges” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q.

income taxes

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial
statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits,
benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise
from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial
statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision
in a subsequent period.

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery
is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we
will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated
condensed balance sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred
tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery
was not likely. changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments
could affect our future provision for taxes.

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we
determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step
requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to
estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we
reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors
including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively
settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement
would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

inventory

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
inventory that is not of saleable quality. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory
requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. the estimate of future demand is
compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. as of june 27, 2009, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1,209
million and total finished goods inventory of $1,211 million. the demand forecast is included in
the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory
valuation and build decisions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory
valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our
products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of
the selling price in relation to the product cost. if our demand forecast for specific products is
greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, or if we fail to
forecast the demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively
impact our gross margin. in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of
inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities.
if the factory loadings are below normal capacity a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs
will not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore, will be recognized as cost of sales
in that period, which negatively impacts our gross margin.

accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements

for a description of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements, including the
expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated condensed financial
statements, see “note 2: accounting changes” and “note 3: recent accounting pronouncements” in the

our net revenue for q2 2009 was $8.0 billion, a decrease of 15% compared to q2 2008. across
the majority of our microprocessor and chipset products we experienced a decline in unit sales
compared to q2 2008. however, with the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets, overall
microprocessor and chipset units only decreased slightly. in addition, the ramp of intel atom
processors and chipsets led to a decrease in average selling prices for microprocessors and
chipsets compared to q2 2008. revenue from the sale of communication products and nor flash memory
products declined approximately $170 million, primarily as a result of the divestiture of these
businesses. additionally, revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products declined.

revenue in
the europe, japan, americas, and asia-pacific regions decreased by
34%, 19%, 14%, and 8%, respectively
compared to q2 2008.

our overall gross margin dollars for q2 2009 were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 22%,
compared to q2 2008. our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 50.8% in q2 2009, from 55.4%
in q2 2008. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin
percentage decrease in the mobility group and digital enterprise group operating segments. this was
partially offset by the gross margin percentage increase in the nand solutions group operating
segment. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in q2 2009 and q2 2008 from the sales
of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments. see
“business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

digital enterprise group

the revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group (deg) operating segment for q2
2009 and q2 2008 were as follows:

net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased by $1.1 billion, or 20%, in q2 2009 compared to
q2 2008. microprocessors within deg include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise
computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors. the decrease in microprocessor
revenue was primarily due to lower unit sales. higher enterprise average selling prices were
partially offset by lower desktop average selling prices. the decrease in chipset, motherboard, and
other revenue was due to lower chipset average selling prices and unit sales as well as lower
revenue from the sale of communications products and lower motherboard unit sales.

operating income decreased by $792 million, or 46%, in q2 2009 compared to q2 2008. the decrease in
operating income was primarily due to lower desktop microprocessors and chipset revenue. in
addition, during the second quarter of 2009 we recorded approximately $110 million of factory
underutilization charges, primarily relating to microprocessors and chipsets. this was partially
offset by lower operating expenses.

mobility group

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group (mg) operating segment for q2 2009 and q2

net revenue for the mg operating segment decreased by $316 million, or 8%, in q2 2009 compared to
q2 2008. the decrease in microprocessor revenue was due to lower microprocessor average selling
prices partially offset by higher microprocessor unit sales. the increase in unit sales and the
decrease in average selling prices were due to the ramp of intel atom processors. the decrease in
chipset and other revenue was primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity
products.

operating income decreased by $449 million, or 36%, in q2 2009 compared to q2 2008. the decrease
was primarily due to lower microprocessor revenue and approximately $230 million of factory
underutilization charges recorded during the second quarter of 2009, primarily related to
microprocessors and chipsets. in addition, operating income also decreased due to higher start-up
costs.

operating expenses

research and development. r&d spending decreased $165 million, or 11%, in q2 2009 compared to q2
2008. this decrease was primarily due to lower process development costs as we transitioned from
research and development to manufacturing using our 32nm manufacturing process technology, and to a
lesser extent, lower profit-dependent compensation.

46



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses increased
$1.3 billion, or 89%, in q2 2009 compared to q2 2008. this increase was due to the q2 2009 charge
of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the european commission (see “note
23: contingencies” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q).
advertising expenses, including cooperative advertising expenses, and
profit-dependent compensation
were lower in q2 2009 compared to q2 2008.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 50% of net revenue in q2
2009 (31% of net revenue in q2 2008).

our net revenue for the first half of 2009 was $15.2 billion, a decrease of 21% compared to
the first half of 2008. across the majority of our microprocessor and chipset products we
experienced a decline in unit sales compared to the first half of 2008. however, with the ramp of
intel atom processors and chipsets, the decline of overall microprocessor and chipset units was not
as significant. in addition, the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets led to a decrease in
average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets compared to the first half of 2008. revenue
from the sale of nor flash memory products and communication products declined approximately $570
million, primarily as a result of the divestiture of these businesses. additionally, revenue from
the sale of wireless connectivity products declined.

revenue in the europe, japan, americas, and asia-pacific regions decreased by 33%, 24%, 20%, and
16%, respectively compared to the first half of 2008.

our overall gross margin dollars for the first half of 2009 were $7.3 billion, a decrease of $3.1
billion, or 30%, compared to the first half of 2008. our overall gross margin percentage decreased
to 48.2% in the first half of 2009, from 54.6% in the first half of 2008. the decrease in gross
margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the
mobility group and digital enterprise group operating segments. this was partially offset by the
gross margin percentage increase in the nand solutions group operating segment. we derived
substantially all of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in the first half of
2009 and most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in the first half of 2008
from the sales of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating
segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased by $2.5 billion, or 23%, in the first half of
2009 compared to the first half of 2008. microprocessors within deg include microprocessors
designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded
microprocessors. the decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower unit sales.
higher enterprise average selling prices were partially offset by lower desktop average selling
prices. the decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to lower chipset unit sales
and average selling prices as well as lower revenue from the sale of communications products and
lower motherboard unit sales.

operating income decreased by $1.9 billion, or 53%, in the first half of 2009 compared to the first
half of 2008. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the lower revenue. in addition,
during the first half of 2009 we recorded approximately $360 million of factory underutilization
charges, primarily relating to microprocessors and chipsets. this was partially offset by lower
operating expenses.

mobility group

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group (mg) operating segment for the first half
of 2009 and the first half of 2008 were as follows:

net revenue for the mg operating segment decreased by $1.1 billion, or 14%, in the first half of
2009 compared to the first half of 2008. the decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due
to lower microprocessor average selling prices partially offset by higher microprocessor unit
sales. the increase in unit sales and the decrease in average selling prices were due to the ramp
of intel atom processors. the decrease in chipset and other revenue was primarily due to lower
revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products and lower chipset average selling prices.

operating income decreased by $1.4 billion, or 57%, in the first half of 2009 compared to the first
half of 2008. the decrease was primarily due to lower microprocessor and chipset revenue and
approximately $650 million of factory underutilization charges recorded during the first half of
2009, primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets. in addition, lower microprocessor unit
costs were mostly offset by approximately $170 million of higher start-up costs.

research and development. r&d spending decreased $315 million, or 11%, in the first half of 2009
compared to the first half of 2008. this decrease was primarily due to lower process development
costs as we transition from research and development to manufacturing using our 32nm manufacturing
process technology and, to a lesser extent, lower profit–dependent compensation.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses increased
$1.1 billion, or 40%, in the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008. this increase
was due to the q2 2009 charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the ec
(see “note 23: contingencies” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this
form 10-q). advertising expenses, including cooperative advertising
expenses, and profit-dependent
compensation were lower in the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 43% of net revenue in the
first half of 2009 (30% of net revenue in the first half of 2008).

we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit
arrangements, and facility-related or other exit activities. our outlook for the third quarter of
2009 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of $40 million.

2009 restructuring program

in the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing
and assembly and test operations, and align our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity to
current market conditions. these plans include closing two assembly and test facilities in
malaysia, one facility in the philippines, and one facility in china; stopping production at a
200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication
facility in california. restructuring and asset impairment charges were as follows:

we recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment
charges. the remaining accrual as of june 27, 2009 was related to severance benefits that are
recorded within accrued compensation and benefits.

the charges include $142 million that relate to employee severance and benefit arrangements for
approximately 6,900 employees, of which 2,000 employees have left the company as of june 27, 2009.
most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing.

we estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings
of approximately $350 million. the substantial majority of these savings will be realized within
cost of sales.

2006 efficiency program

in the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan
designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. restructuring and asset

during q1 2008, we incurred $275 million in additional asset impairment charges related to assets
that we sold in q2 2008 in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business. we
determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable
that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs. the lower fair value was
primarily a result of a decline in the outlook for the flash memory market segment. we had
previously incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges in 2007 related to assets that we sold
in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business. we determined the impairment
charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of
the divestiture.

we recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment
charges. the remaining accrual as of june 27, 2009 was related to severance benefits that are
recorded within accrued compensation and benefits.

from q3 2006 through q2 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset
impairment charges related to this plan. these charges included a total of $686 million related to
employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 11,300 employees, of which 11,000
employees had left the company as of june 27, 2009. a substantial majority of these employee
actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. we paid
$658 million of the employee severance and benefit charges incurred as of june 27, 2009. the
restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset impairment charges.

divestitures (none in the first half of 2009 and $39 million in the first half of 2008) in the
first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008. these decreases were partially offset by
approximately $60 million of fair value gains in the first half of 2009 on our trading assets,
compared to approximately $30 million of fair value losses in the first half of 2008. interest
income was lower in the first half of 2009 compared to the first half of 2008 as a result of lower
interest rates and, to a lesser extent, lower average investment balances.

based on

the ec fine of $1.447 billion, with no associated reduction in the provision for taxes
significantly increased our effective tax rate in the first half of 2009. the impact of the ec fine
was partially offset by a higher percentage of estimated profits in lower tax jurisdictions in the
first half of 2009 as compared to the first half of 2008.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

business outlook

our future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in
this form 10-q, including this md&a, involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular:





 
•
 
current economic uncertainty, including the tightening of credit markets,
as well as future economic conditions;


 
•
 
our goals and strategies;


 
•
 
new product introductions;


 
•
 
plans to cultivate new businesses;


 
•
 
divestitures or investments;


 
•
 
revenue and pricing;


 
•

•
 
depreciation;


 
•
 
potential impairment of investments;


 
•
 
our effective tax rate; and


 
•
 
pending legal proceedings.





the ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to
predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results
could differ materially from our expectations. in addition to the various important factors
discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ
materially from our expectations. see the risks described in “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of
this form 10-q.

our expectations for the remainder of 2009 include the effects of the wind river acquisition and
are as follows:




 
q3 2009


 
•
 
revenue: $8.5 billion, plus or minus  $400 million.


 
•
 
gross margin percentage: 53% plus or minus a couple points.


 
•
 
depreciation: approximately $1.2 billion.


 
•
 
research and development plus marketing, general and administrative expenses:
approximately $2.8 billion.


 
•
 
restructuring and asset impairment charges: approximately $40 million.


 
•
 
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs: approximately $40
million.


 
•
 
net gains (losses) from equity method investments, gains (losses) on other
equity investments, and interest and other: net loss of approximately $80 million.


 
full year 2009


 
•
 
capital spending: approximately $4.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million.


 
•
 
depreciation: approximately $4.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million.


 
•
 
research and development plus marketing, general and administrative expenses:
between $12.05 billion and $12.25 billion. this includes the $1.447 billion expense
associated with the ec fine recognized during the second quarter.


 
•
 
tax rate: approximately 23% for the third and fourth quarters. the estimated
effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of june 27, 2009 and current expected
income.



status of business outlook

we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with
investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking
statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q, including
any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. at the same time, we will
keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor
relations web site at www.intc.com. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook
published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we
publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the “business outlook” and other
forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year
in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times.

from the close of business on august 28, 2009 until our quarterly earnings release is published,
presently scheduled for october 13, 2009, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet
period, the “business outlook” and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k
filed on july 14, 2009, as reiterated or updated as applicable, in this form 10-q, should be
considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update.
during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our
financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and
any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes
in assets and liabilities.

cash from operations for the first half of 2009 was $3.8 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion
compared to the first half of 2008, primarily due to lower net income and changes billion in our working
capital. in the second quarter of 2009, our net income was negatively impacted by the charge
related to the ec fine of
€1.06 billion ($1.447 billion as of may 13, 2009). however, the fine has not
yet been paid, and the liability ($1.483 billion as of june 27, 2009) was included in other accrued
liabilities. we expect to pay the fine in the third quarter during which our cash from operations
will be negatively impacted.

inventories as of june 27, 2009 decreased compared to december 27, 2008, due to lower
microprocessor, chipset, and raw materials inventory. accounts payable as of june 27, 2009
decreased compared to december 27, 2008, due to lower production spending. as of june, 27, 2009,
our other accrued liabilities included $89 million in customer credit balances ($447 million as of
december 27, 2008). accounts receivable as of june 27, 2009 increased compared to december 27, 2008
due to a higher proportion of sales occurring at the end of the second quarter of 2009. for the
first half of 2009, our two largest customers accounted for 39% of net revenue (38% for the first
half of 2008) with one of those customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue, and another
customer accounting for 18% of our net revenue. these two largest customers accounted for 41% of
net accounts receivable at june 27, 2009 (46% at december 27, 2008).

investing activities

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases,
maturities, and disposals.

the decrease in cash used for investing activities in the first half of 2009 compared to first half
of 2008 was driven primarily by an increase in maturities and sales of trading assets and a
decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets, partially offset by a
decrease in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and higher capital spending.

financing activities

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock, payment of
dividends to stockholders, and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive
plans.

the decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first half of 2009, compared to the first
half of 2008, was primarily due to the absence of repurchases and retirement of common stock as
part of our common stock repurchase program in the first half of 2009, partially offset by a
decrease in proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans. in the first
half of 2008, we repurchased $5.1 billion, including the purchase of 230.7 million shares of common
stock as part of our common stock repurchase program. as of june 27, 2009, $7.4 billion remained
available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. we base our
level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. our
dividend payment was $1.6 billion in the first half of 2009, slightly higher than the $1.5 billion
paid in the first half of 2008. proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity
incentive plans totaled $248 million for the first half of 2009 compared to $828 million for the
first half of 2008, as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options.

liquidity

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. as of june 27, 2009, cash
and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments
totaled $11.3 billion.

our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities at the time of investment
of up to 6 months to be rated at least a-1/p-1 by standard & poor’s/moody’s, and specifies a higher
minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. for instance, investments with maturities of
greater than three years require a minimum rating of aa-/aa3 at the time of investment. government
regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-u.s. subsidiaries, or the absence of a
rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. substantially all of
our investments in debt instruments are with a/a2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial
majority of the issuers are rated aa-/aa3 or better. additionally, we limit the amount of credit
exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty’s relative credit
standing. as of june 27, 2009, the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed
$500 million.

credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. the
amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the
amounts, if any, by which a counterparty’s obligations exceed our obligations with that
counterparty, because we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible
to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions subject to international swaps and derivatives
association, inc. (isda) agreements.

the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit
environment, with credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses on our available-for-sale
debt instruments limited to less than $55 million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008. in
addition, we continue to be able to invest in high-quality investments. with the exception of a
limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments, we
have not seen significant liquidation delays, and for those that have matured we have received the
full par value of our original debt investments. we do not intend to sell our debt investments that
have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). in addition, it is not
more likely than not that we will be required to sell our debt investments that have unrealized
losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before we recover the amortized cost basis.

as of june 27, 2009, our balance of cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading
assets, and short-term investments included $9.7 billion with a remaining maturity of less than one
year. as of june 27, 2009, our cumulative unrealized losses, net of corresponding hedging
activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were approximately $85 million
(approximately $145 million as of december 27, 2008). as of june 27, 2009, our cumulative
unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately
$165 million (approximately $215 million as of december 27, 2008). substantially all of our
unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment
that resulted in a decrease in the market liquidity for debt instruments.

we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate
exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors. we intend to continue
to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our
investment policy as deemed necessary. based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio
and our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result
of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing
authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the
issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the
first half of 2009 were approximately $610 million, although no commercial paper remained
outstanding as of june 27, 2009. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1
by moody’s as of june 27, 2009. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with
the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.

subsequent to the second quarter of 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of 3.25% junior subordinated
convertible debentures due in 2039. we utilized the majority of the proceeds to repurchase shares
of our common stock. see “note 17: borrowings” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q.

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next
12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test,
working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions
or strategic investments.

additionally, subsequent to the second quarter of 2009, cash outlays related to the following have
occurred or are expected to occur in the near the future:




 
•
 
ec fine of €1.06 billion, for which we recorded a liability of
$1.483 billion in other accrued liabilities as of june 27, 2009. see “note 23:
contingencies” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form
10-q.


 
•
 
acquisition of wind river,  in exchange for $884 million to be
paid to the stockholders of wind river.



fair value of financial instruments

the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the provisions of sfas no.
157. sfas no. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. observable
inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas
unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset
or liability. a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at
fair value on a recurring basis. when fair value is determined using observable market prices, the
credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument. when fair value is
determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk
and/or intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate.
during the first half of 2009, the valuation of our liabilities measured and recorded at fair value
as well as our derivative instruments in a current or potential net liability position were not
impacted by changes in our credit risk. in addition, changes in counterparty credit risk did not
have a significant impact on the valuation of either our marketable debt instruments, loans
receivable, or derivative instruments in a current or potential net asset position during the first
half of 2009.

when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of
the instruments being measured, we classify those instruments as level 3 under the sfas no. 157
hierarchy. as of june 27, 2009, our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis included $15.2 billion of assets, of which $1.4 billion (9%) were classified as
level 3. in addition, our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $315 million of liabilities, of which $172 million (55%) were classified as level 3.
during the first half of 2009, we transferred approximately $365 million of assets from level 3 to
level 2. these assets consisted of floating-rate notes that were transferred from level 3 to level
2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and/or non-binding market consensus
prices to value or corroborate the value of our instruments. during the first half of 2009, we
recognized an insignificant amount of gains or losses on the assets that were transferred from
level 3 to level 2.

during the first half of 2009, the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at
fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value gains totaling $20 million.
of this amount, gains of $54 million were recognized in our consolidated condensed statements of
operations and losses of $34 million were included in other comprehensive income (loss). we believe
the losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) represent a temporary decline in the fair
value of available-for-sale investments. during the first half of 2009, we did not experience any
significant realized gains (losses) related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio.

marketable debt instruments

as of june 27, 2009, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included
$14.0 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, approximately $1.1 billion was
classified as level 1, approximately $11.5 billion as level 2, and approximately $1.4 billion as
level 3.

when available, we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable
debt instruments. if observable market prices are not available, we use non-binding market
consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data, if available, or
non-observable market data. when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument,
we use observable market quotes to price our instruments, in lieu of prices from other sources.

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable
market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. marketable debt
instruments in this category generally include certain of our floating-rate notes, corporate bonds,
and money market fund deposits. management judgment was required to determine our policy that
defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to
be considered active. our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments
generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the
valuation date of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual
instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount
of the issued instrument.

approximately 15% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at
fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage
of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. when
observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt
instruments using: non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market
data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash
flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.
non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing
providers or brokers. these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding
and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and
the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a
lesser degree non-observable market inputs. we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices
with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exist. the
discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as libor-based yield curves,
currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. approximately 45% of our balance of marketable
debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified
as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are
corroborated with observable market data and approximately 40% due to the usage of a discounted
cash flow model. marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 generally include commercial
paper, bank time deposits, municipal bonds, certain of our money market fund deposits and corporate
bonds, and a majority of floating-rate notes.

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to
corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when
observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and
non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. marketable debt instruments in
this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our floating-rate notes and
corporate bonds. all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3, and
substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not
able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for
asset-backed securities.

equity securities

as of june 27, 2009, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $513 million of marketable equity securities. of these securities, $493 million was
classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities
in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities
generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the
valuation date for each individual security, including the number of days each individual equity
security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares
of that security. the fair values of our investments in clearwire corporation ($179 million) and
vmware, inc. ($133 million) constituted a majority of the fair values of the marketable equity
securities that we classified as level 1. the remaining marketable equity securities ($20 million)
were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for
identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions.

as of june 27, 2009, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $319 million of equity securities offsetting deferred compensation. all of these
securities were classified as level 1, because their valuations were based on quoted prices for
identical securities in active markets.

contractual obligations

during the second quarter of 2009, we agreed to acquire all outstanding common shares of wind river
 for $884 million to be paid to the stockholders of wind river. we completed the acquisition subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2009.

subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of junior subordinated convertible
debentures (the 2009 debentures) due in 2039. the 2009 debentures pay a fixed rate of 3.25% cash
interest semiannually beginning february 1, 2010. our total anticipated cash payments (including
anticipated interest payments that will not be recorded on the
consolidated condensed balance sheets and
excluding fair value adjustments that affect the amount recorded on
the consolidated condensed balance
sheets) over the life of this long-term debt obligation are expected to be approximately $4.0
billion. any future settlement of convertible debt would reduce anticipated interest and/or
principal payments.
