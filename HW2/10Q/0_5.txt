seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the company’s fiscal year 2017 will include 53 weeks and will end on september 30, 2017. a 14th week was included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.second quarter fiscal 2017 highlightsnet sales increased 5% or $2.3 billion during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016, primarily driven by strong growth in services, mac and other products, partially offset by the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. net sales reflected year-over-year growth in each of the geographic operating segments, with the exception of greater china. during the second quarter of 2017, the company introduced a new 9.7-inch ipad, which became available at the end of the quarter. the company utilized $7.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.0 billion during the second quarter of 2017. additionally, the company issued $11.0 billion of u.s. dollar-denominated long-term debt.sales datathe following table shows net sales by

company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. the company’s reportable operating segments consist of the americas, europe, greater china, japan and rest of asia pacific. the americas segment includes both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as india, the middle east and africa. the greater china segment includes china, hong kong and taiwan. the rest of asia pacific segment includes australia and those asian countries not included in the company’s other reportable operating segments. although the reportable operating segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. further information regarding the company’s reportable operating segments can be found in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q in the notes to condensed

due primarily to higher product cost structures and the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services.27the company anticipates gross margin during the third quarter of 2017 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the

business strategy. selling, general and administrativethe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising. the year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first

interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange-related items, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. the weighted-average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.99% and 1.74% in the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 1.93% and 1.70% in the first six months of 2017 and 2016,

rate24.9% 25.6% 25.6% 25.4%the company’s effective tax rates during the second quarter of 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, for which no u.s. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the lower effective tax rate during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 was due primarily to a different geographic mix of earnings. the slightly higher effective tax rate in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit during the first quarter of 2016.the company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. while the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission's guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by ireland, the company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes. recent accounting pronouncementsrestricted cashin november 2016, the financial accounting standards board (“fasb”) issued accounting standards update (“asu”) no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash (“asu 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. the company will adopt asu 2016-18 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the retrospective adoption method. currently, the company's restricted cash balance is not significant.income taxesin october 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory (“asu 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. the company will adopt asu 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. currently, the company anticipates recording up to $9 billion of net deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheets. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date. the company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these deferred tax assets are utilized.stock compensationin march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, compensation – stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting (“asu 2016-09”), which modifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards, and classification in the statement of cash flows. the company will adopt asu 2016-09 in its first quarter of 2018. currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the company's equity awards are recorded as additional paid-in capital in its consolidated balance sheets. upon adoption, the company will record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards in its consolidated statements of operations in the reporting periods in which vesting occurs. as a result, subsequent to adoption the company's income tax expense and associated effective tax rate will be impacted by fluctuations in stock price between the grant dates and vesting dates of equity awards.28leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02,

customers (topic 606) (“asu 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. asu 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.subsequently, the fasb has issued the following standards related to asu 2014-09: asu no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (“asu 2016-08”); asu no. 2016-10, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): identifying performance obligations and licensing

improvements to topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers (“asu 2016-20”). the company must adopt asu 2016-08, asu 2016-10, asu 2016-12 and asu 2016-20 with asu 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”).the new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. the

seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal

during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016, primarily driven by strong growth in services, mac and other products, partially offset by the effect of weakness in foreign

due primarily to higher product cost structures and the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services.27the company anticipates gross margin during the third quarter of 2017 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the

focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products that are central to the company’s core business strategy. selling, general and administrativethe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising. the year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first

cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.99% and 1.74% in the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 1.93% and 1.70% in the first six months of 2017 and 2016,

rate24.9% 25.6% 25.6% 25.4%the company’s effective tax rates during the second quarter of 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, for which no u.s. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the lower effective tax rate during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 was due primarily to a different geographic mix of earnings. the slightly higher effective tax rate in the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit during the first quarter of 2016.the company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. while the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission's guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by ireland, the company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes. recent accounting pronouncementsrestricted cashin november 2016, the financial accounting standards board (“fasb”) issued accounting standards update (“asu”) no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash (“asu 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. the company will adopt asu 2016-18 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the retrospective adoption method. currently, the company's restricted cash balance is not significant.income taxesin october 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory (“asu 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. the company will adopt asu 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. currently, the company anticipates recording up to $9 billion of net deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheets. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date. the company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these deferred tax assets are utilized.stock compensationin march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, compensation – stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting (“asu 2016-09”), which modifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards, and classification in the statement of cash flows. the company will adopt asu 2016-09 in its first quarter of 2018. currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the company's equity awards are recorded as additional paid-in capital in its consolidated balance sheets. upon adoption, the company will record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards in its consolidated statements of operations in the reporting periods in which vesting occurs. as a result, subsequent to adoption the company's income tax expense

key information about leasing arrangements. asu 2016-02 will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted. the company will use a modified retrospective adoption approach. while the company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting asu 2016-02, currently the company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $8.2 billion on its consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact to its consolidated statements of operations. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-02 will depend on the company's lease portfolio as of the adoption date.financial instruments in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01, financial instruments – overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities (“asu 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. based on the composition of the company's investment portfolio, the adoption of asu 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, financial instruments – credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (“asu 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. based on the composition of the company's investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of asu 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (“asu 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. asu 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.subsequently, the fasb has issued the following standards related to asu 2014-09: asu no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (“asu 2016-08”); asu no. 2016-10, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): identifying performance obligations and licensing (“asu 2016-10”); asu no. 2016-12, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (“asu 2016-12”); and asu no. 2016-20, technical corrections and improvements to topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers (“asu 2016-20”). the company must adopt asu 2016-08, asu 2016-10, asu 2016-12 and asu 2016-20 with asu 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”).the new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. the company plans to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective adoption method. the new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the company's consolidated financial statements.liquidity and capital resourcesthe following tables present selected financial information and statistics
