item 2.  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe following discussion and analysis supplements management's discussion and analysis of mastercard incorporated for the year ended december 31, 2014 as contained in the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 13, 2015.  it also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated (together, “mastercard” or the “company”), included elsewhere in this report.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, contra revenue and general and administrative expenses were revised to correctly classify $9 million and $14 million, respectively, of customer incentive expenses as contra revenue instead of general and administrative expenses.  this revision had no impact on net income.  percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.non-gaap financial informationnon-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (“gaap”).  pursuant to the requirements of regulation s-k, portions of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include a reconciliation of certain non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.  the presentation of non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap.  mastercard presents non-gaap financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of mastercard’s ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of its results between periods.  mastercard’s management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.  see “financial results overview” for the table that provides a reconciliation of the operating results and growth to the most directly comparable gaap measure.  these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of the following special item (“special item”) for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015: •a provision for a settlement relating to a merchant litigation in the u.k. (the “uk merchant litigation settlement provision”) ($61 million pre-tax and $44 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share).  mastercard excluded this item because its management monitors provisions for material litigation settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. overview mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  as the operator of what we believe is the world’s fastest payments network, we facilitate the processing of payment transactions, including authorization, clearing and settlement, and deliver related

cirrus.  we also provide value-added offerings such as loyalty and reward programs, information services and consulting.  our network is designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.  a typical transaction on our network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder, merchant, issuer (the cardholder’s financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).  we do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our branded cards.  in most cases, cardholder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution customers.we generate revenue by charging fees primarily to issuers and acquirers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services, as well as by assessing these customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or gross dollar volume (“gdv”), on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.our strategyour ability to grow our business is influenced by personal consumption expenditure

overviewwe recorded net income of $921 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, and $1.9 billion, or $1.69 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, versus net income of $931 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, and $1.8 billion, or $1.53 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2014, respectively.  net income decreased 1% and increased 8% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014. excluding the impact of the special item we had adjusted net income of $965 million, or $0.85 per adjusted diluted share, and $2.0 billion, or $1.73 per adjusted diluted share for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively.  adjusted net income increased 4% for the three months ended june 30, 2015, versus the comparable period in 2014, due to an improved effective tax rate and higher net revenue, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and the impact from acquisitions.  adjusted net income increased 10% for the six months ended june 30, 2015, versus the comparable period in 2014, driven by higher net revenue and an improved effective tax rate, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and the impact from acquisitions.  acquisitions had a negative impact to net income growth of 4 and 3 percentage points for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014, or $(0.03) and $(0.06) per diluted share for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively.    our net revenue increased 1% and 2% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014, primarily driven by increases across our revenue categories, mainly offset by higher rebates and incentives and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth for both the three and six months ended june 30, 2015.  for both the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, our processed transactions increased 13% versus the comparable periods in 2014.  our volumes also increased 13% and 12% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, on a local currency basis, versus the comparable periods in 2014. operating expenses increased 15% and 8% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014.  excluding the impact of the special item, adjusted operating expenses increased 9% and 4% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014, primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses as a result of our acquisition activity, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.  acquisitions had a negative impact of 9 percentage points to the operating expense growth for both the three and six months ended june 30, 2015.  we generated net cash flows from operations of $1.7 billion for the six months ended june 30, 2015, compared to $1.3 billion for the comparable period in 2014.24table of contentsthe

financial information.business environment we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies.  net revenue generated in the united states was 39% for both the three months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014 and 39% and 40% for the six months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total revenue in any such period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time.  while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around 25table of contentsthe world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate.  certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  in addition, further political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  as a result, our revenue may be negatively impacted, or the company may be impacted in several ways.  mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry.  notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business.  for a full discussion see, “risk factors - business risks” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014.in addition, our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries.  regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry.  for further discussion, see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and our risk factors in “risk factors - legal and regulatory risks” in part i, item 1a (risk factors) of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014.  further, information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years.  although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future.  see our risk factor in “risk factors - business risks” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014 related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks. impact of foreign currency ratesour overall operating results can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real.  the functional currency of mastercard europe, our principal european operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real.  accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the u.s. dollar.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, the u.s. dollar strengthened against both the euro and the brazilian real.  for the three months ended june 30, 2015, the euro and the brazilian real devalued against the u.s. dollar by 19% and 27%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014.  for the six months ended june 30, 2015, the euro and the brazilian real devalued against the u.s. dollar by 18% and 22%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014.  the net foreign currency impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real negatively impacted net income by 8 percentage points and 7 percentage points for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, net revenue was negatively impacted by 6 percentage points for both periods and operating expenses were favorably impacted by 5 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively.in addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives.  in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies.  the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, gdv on a u.s. dollar converted basis increased 1% and 2%, while gdv on a local currency basis grew 13% and 12%, respectively.  the company attempts to manage the impact from these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation.  while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis, they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the u.s. dollar.26table of contentsfinancial resultsrevenuerevenue descriptionmastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders’ financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions).  our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services.  our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers.  our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers.  our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following:•domestic or cross-border transactions;•signature-based or pin-based transactions;•geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs;•volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates;•processed or not processed across the mastercard network;•amount of usage of our other products or services; and•amount of rebates and incentives provided to customers.the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories:1.domestic assessments: domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same.  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.2.cross-border volume fees: cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different.  in general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.3.transaction processing fees: transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions.  transaction processing fees include charges to issuers for the following:•transaction switching fees for the following products and services:◦authorization is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval.  in certain circumstances such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer approve in accordance with either the issuer’s instructions or applicable rules (also known as “stand-in”).◦clearing is the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.◦settlement is facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.•connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages.  these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company’s network.27table of contents4.other revenues: other revenues consist of other payment-related products and services and are primarily associated with the following:•consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company’s professional advisory services group.•fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions.  this includes fees for warning bulletins provided to issuers and acquirers either electronically or in paper form.•loyalty and rewards solution fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with mastercard-branded cards, such as insurance, assistance for lost cards, locating atms and rewards programs.•program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.•the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related products and services, including account and transaction enhancement services, rules compliance and publications.5.rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue.revenue analysisin the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, gross revenue increased $185 million and  $386 million, or 6% for both periods, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014.  gross revenue growth in the three and six months ended june 30, 2015 was driven by an increase in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, transactions, other payment-related products and services and the impact of acquisitions.  rebates and incentives, in the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, increased $163 million and $306 million, or 21% and 20%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014 primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.  our net revenue increased 1% and 2% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to both periods, while foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 6 percentage points for both periods to net revenue growth.  during the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, our gdv increased 13% and 12% on a local currency while our processed transactions increased 13% for both periods, respectively.the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth: three months

circumstances.   see our risk factor in “risk factor - business risks” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014.28table of contentsthe

for the three months ended june 30, 2015, adjusted operating expenses increased primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses as a result of acquisition activity, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.  for the six months ended june 30, 2015, adjusted operating expenses increased primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses as a result of acquisition activity, partially offset by gains associated with foreign exchange activity for derivative contracts and balance sheet remeasurement, as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, acquisitions had a negative impact of 9 percentage points for both periods, while foreign currency translation had a favorable

30, 2015 was offset by gains associated with foreign exchange activity for derivative contracts and balance sheet remeasurement.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, acquisitions had a negative impact of 11 and 10 percentage points, respectively, while foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 4 percentage points for both periods on the general and administrative expenses change.  the significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: three months ended june 30, percent increase (decrease) six months ended june 30, percent increase (decrease) 2015 2014  2015 2014  (in millions, except percentages)personnel$488 $485 —% $956 $935 2%professional

an increase in the number of employees from our acquired businesses, offset by improved cost controls and the favorable impact from foreign currency translation.•professional fees consist primarily of third-party services, legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and the evaluation of regulatory developments that impact our industry and brand. 30table of contents•data processing and telecommunication expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other telecommunication systems.  these expenses increased due to capacity growth of our business.•foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  see note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.  since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize.  during the the six months ended june 30, 2015, we recorded gains on derivative contracts due to foreign exchange rate movements and gains from the balance sheet remeasurement related primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar.•other expenses include costs to provide loyalty and rewards programs, travel and meeting expenses and rental expense for our facilities.  other expenses increased for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015 versus the comparable periods in 2014, primarily due to the impact of our acquisitions and expenses incurred to support strategic development efforts.advertising and marketingour brands, principally mastercard, are valuable strategic assets that drive acceptance and usage of our products and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally.  our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotions, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale.  we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences.  advertising and marketing expenses changed slightly for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015 versus the comparable periods in 2014, mainly due to the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, off set by the timing of media spend and sponsorship promotions to support our strategic initiatives.depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expenses increased $11 million and $25 million, or 15% and 16% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014.  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs associated with our acquisitions.other income (expense)other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses.  total other expense for the six months ended june 30, 2015 increased primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in march 2014 versus the comparable period in 2014.income taxes the effective income tax rates were 25.7% and 32.2% for the three months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  the effective income tax rates were 24.8% and 32.1% for the six months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  for the three months ended june 30, 2015, the effective tax rate was lower than the effective tax rate for the comparable period in 2014, due to a larger repatriation benefit, the recognition of a discrete benefit relating to certain foreign taxes becoming eligible to be claimed as credits in the united states and a more favorable mix of taxable earnings.  for the six months ended june 30, 2015, the effective tax rate was lower than the effective tax rate for the comparable period in 2014, due to the recognition of a discrete benefit relating to certain foreign taxes becoming eligible to be claimed as credits in the united states, a larger repatriation benefit and a more favorable mix of taxable earnings.  during the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the u.s.  this initiative resulted in a one-time taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom.  we believe this improved alignment will result in greater flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash, as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate.  within the next six months, the company believes that the favorable resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local tax examinations is reasonably possible and that a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits, may occur.  while such a change may be significant, it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further.  31table of contentssee note 10 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion of these items. liquidity and capital resourceswe need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.  the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations.  the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and investment securities balances and credit available to the company at june 30, 2015 and december 31,

related to the u.s. merchant class litigation settlement of $541 million and $540 million at june 30, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.2 the company did not use any funds from the line of credit during the periods presented.cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $3.1 billion and $2.6 billion at june 30, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively, or 62% and 42% of our total cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities as of such dates.  it is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 17 (income tax) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings.  if these earnings are needed for u.s. operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states, the company would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation.our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers.  see note 12 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part i, item 1 of this report for a description of these guarantees.  historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of the future.  the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see part i, item 1a - risk factors of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014;

million for the six months ended june 30, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014 due to purchases of other short term investments, acquisitions and return of restricted cash for litigation

million for the six months ended june 30, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014 due to proceeds from the company’s debt offering completed on march 31, 2014 and higher dividends paid in the
