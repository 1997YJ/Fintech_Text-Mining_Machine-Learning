references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and
financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of third quarter 2016 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
third quarter 2016 earnings were $2.7 billion, or $0.63 per diluted share,
compared with $4.2 billion a year earlier. results reflect lower refining
margins and commodity prices.
 
exxonmobil’s
integrated business continues to deliver solid results. while the operating
environment remains challenging, the company continues to focus on capturing
efficiencies, advancing strategic investments, and creating long-term
shareholder value.



 


 


 



 
earnings
in the first nine months of 2016 were $6.2 billion, down $7.2 billion, or 54
percent, from 2015.
 
earnings
per share assuming dilution were $1.47.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $14.5 billion, down 39 percent from 2015.
 
oil-equivalent
production was essentially unchanged at 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per
day, with liquids up 2.6 percent and natural gas down 4.4 percent.
 
the
corporation distributed $9.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.

upstream earnings
were $620 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $738 million from the
third quarter of 2015. lower liquids and gas realizations decreased earnings by
$880 million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million.
all other items, including lower expenses partly offset by unfavorable foreign
exchange effects, increased earnings by $60 million.
 
on an oil-equivalent basis,
production was down compared with the third quarter of 2015. liquids production
totaled 2.2 million barrels per day, down 120,000 barrels per day. higher
downtime, mainly in nigeria, and field decline were partly offset by project
start-ups. natural gas production was 9.6 billion cubic feet per day, up 77
million cubic feet per day from 2015 as project start-ups more than offset
field decline and divestment impacts.
 
u.s. upstream earnings declined
$35 million from the third quarter of 2015 to a loss of $477 million in the
third quarter of 2016. non-u.s. upstream earnings were $1,097 million, down
$703 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream earnings were $838
million, down $5,406 million from the first nine months of 2015. lower
realizations decreased earnings by $5.8 billion. favorable volume and mix
effects increased earnings by $130 million. all other items increased earnings
by $260 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence of
asset management gains.
 
on an oil-equivalent basis,
production of 4 million barrels per day was essentially flat compared to the
same period in 2015. liquids production of 2.4 million barrels per day
increased 59,000 barrels per day, with project start-ups partly offset by field
decline, the canadian wildfires, and downtime mainly in nigeria. natural gas
production of 10 billion cubic feet per day decreased 458 million cubic feet
per day from 2015 as regulatory restrictions in the netherlands, field decline
and divestment impacts were partly offset by project start-ups.
 
u.s.
upstream earnings declined $1,282 million from 2015 to a loss of $1,823 million
in 2016. earnings outside the u.s. were $2,661 million, down $4,124 million
from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions
that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors include, but
are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program
activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime,
market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that
do not affect entitlements.

downstream
earnings were $1,229 million, down $804 million from the third quarter of 2015.
weaker margins, mainly in refining, decreased earnings by $1.6 billion while
favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $170 million. all other
items increased earnings by $580 million, including lower maintenance expenses
and gains from divestments in canada. petroleum product sales of 5.6 million
barrels per day were 203,000 barrels per day lower than the prior year mainly
due to divestment of the torrance, california, and chalmette, louisiana,
refineries. 
 
earnings
from the u.s. downstream were $225 million, down $262 million from the third
quarter of 2015. non-u.s. downstream earnings of $1,004 million were $542
million lower than prior year. 



 


 


 



 
downstream
earnings of $2,960 million in the first nine months of the year decreased $2,246
million from 2015. weaker refining margins decreased earnings by $3.3 billion,
while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $330 million. all other
items increased earnings by $680 million, mainly reflecting lower maintenance
expense and gains from divestments. petroleum product sales of 5.5 million
barrels per day were 306,000 barrels per day lower than 2015 mainly due to
divestment of the torrance and chalmette refineries.
 
u.s.
downstream earnings were $824 million, a decrease of $642 million from 2015.
non-u.s. downstream earnings were $2,136 million, down $1,604 million from the

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2016 was $6.3 billion,
including asset sales of $1.0 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the comparable
2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $14.7 billion for the first nine months of 2016,
$11.3 billion lower than 2015. the major source of funds was net income
including noncontrolling interests of $6.4 billion, a decrease of $7.4 billion
from the prior year period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $14.2
billion for depreciation and depletion increased by $0.9 billion. changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $2.4 billion in 2016 and
$1.0 billion in 2015. all other items net decreased cash flows by $3.5 billion
in 2016 and had no impact on cash in 2015. for additional details, see the condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2016 used net cash of $10.7 billion, a decrease of
$7.8 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $12.3 billion was $8.1 billion lower than 2015. proceeds
from asset sales of $2.2 billion increased $0.6 billion. additional investment
and advances were $1.4 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion. 
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2016 was $16.9 billion,
including asset sales of $2.2 billion, and decreased $10.7 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
during the first
quarter of 2016, the corporation issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt and
used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used by financing
activities was $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016, $4.9 billion
lower than 2015 reflecting the 2016 debt issuance and a lower level of
purchases of shares of exxonmobil stock in 2016.
  
during the first nine
months of 2016, exxon mobil corporation purchased 9 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.7 billion. these purchases
were made to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and
programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,156 million at year-end to 4,147
million at the end of the third quarter 2016. purchases may be made in both the
open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed to shareholders a total of $9.3 billion in the first nine months of
2016 through dividends. this included $3.1 billion for the third quarter of
2016.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2016 compared to
$4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015.


20



 

 
total debt of $46.2
billion compared to $38.7 billion at year-end 2015. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 20.7 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2016
compared to 18.0 percent at year-end 2015.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

quarter of 2016, a decrease of $1.9 billion from 2015. income tax expense
decreased by $1.0 billion to $0.3 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 20 percent compared to 32 percent in the prior
year period due to a higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by
$0.9 billion to $12.5 billion as a result of lower sales realizations.



 


 


 



 
income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $37.8 billion for the first
nine months of 2016, a decrease of $7.6 billion from 2015. income tax expense
decreased by $4.6 billion to $1.0 billion reflecting lower earnings. the
effective income tax rate was 26 percent compared to 37 percent in the prior
year period due to a higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. sales-based and all other taxes decreased by $3.0
billion to $36.8 billion as a result of lower sales
realizations.
 
in the united
states, the corporation has various u.s. federal income tax positions at issue
with the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years 2006-2011. the irs has
asserted penalties for all years associated with several of those
positions. the corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense
because, in the corporation’s judgment, the irs should not be able to sustain the
penalties under applicable law. the corporation has filed a refund suit for tax
years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court with respect to the positions
at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with
the irs for 2006-2011 would not have a materially adverse effect on the
corporation’s net income or liquidity. the irs has not completed its audit of
tax years after 2011.

exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2016
were $4.2 billion, down 45 percent from the third quarter of 2015. 



 


 


 



 
capital and exploration expenditures in the first nine months of
2016 were $14.5 billion, down 39 percent from the first nine months of 2015 due
primarily to lower major project spending. given continuing efficiencies, market
capture, and project selectivity, the corporation anticipates a 2016 investment
level between $20 and $21 billion.
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation. 
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, revenue from contracts with customers.
the standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. the standard is required to be adopted beginning
january 1, 2018. “sales and other operating revenue” on the consolidated
statement of income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales
transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard, revenue will exclude
sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. this change in
reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation continues to evaluate other
areas of the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements. 
 
in february 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, leases. the standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. the standard is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2019. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
critical accounting estimates
 
as disclosed in exxonmobil’s 2015 form
10-k, low crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the corporation’s
reserves as reported under securities and exchange commission (sec) rules.
average year-to-date crude prices have been significantly affected by the very
low prices experienced during the first quarter of 2016, but have recovered
considerably since that time. if the average prices seen during the first nine
months of 2016 persist for the remainder of the year, under the sec definition
of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil, such as those associated with
the kearl oil sands operations in canada, will not qualify as proved reserves
at year-end 2016. in addition, if these average prices persist, the projected
end-of-field-life for estimating reserves will accelerate for certain liquids
and natural gas operations in north america, resulting in a reduction of proved
reserves at year-end 2016. quantities that could be required to be de-booked as
proved reserves on an sec basis amount to approximately 3.6 billion barrels of
bitumen at kearl, and about 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels in other north
america operations. among the factors that would result in these reserves being
re-booked as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in
average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating
efficiencies. under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government
royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to
exxonmobil. we do not expect the de-booking of reported proved reserves under
sec definitions to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter
our outlook for future production volumes.

in light of
continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, and as
part of its annual planning and budgeting process which is currently in
progress, the corporation will perform an assessment of its major long-lived
assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in late 2015, including north
america natural gas assets and certain other assets across the remainder of its
operations. the assessment will reflect crude and natural gas price outlooks
consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities
and generally consistent with the long-term price forecasts published by
third-party industry and government experts. development of future undiscounted
cash flow estimates requires significant management judgment, particularly in
cases where an asset’s life is expected to extend decades into the future. an
asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows were
less than the asset’s carrying value, and impairment would be measured by the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. the corporation will
complete its asset recoverability assessment and analyze the conclusions of
that assessment in connection with the preparation and review of the
corporation’s year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2016 form 10-k.
until these activities are complete, it is not practicable to reasonably
estimate the existence or range of potential future impairments related to the
corporation’s long-lived assets.
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; asset
carrying values; reported reserves; resource recoveries; and share purchase
levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil or gas
prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry, including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome
of exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government
regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the impact of fiscal
and commercial terms; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other
factors discussed under the heading "factors affecting future
results" in the “investors” section of our website and in item 1a of
exxonmobil's 2015 form 10-k. closing of pending acquisitions is also
subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent provided in the applicable
agreement. we assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.

review
of third quarter 2016 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
third quarter 2016 earnings were $2.7 billion, or $0.63 per diluted share,
compared with $4.2 billion a year earlier. results reflect lower refining
margins and commodity prices.
 
exxonmobil’s
integrated business continues to deliver solid results. while the operating
environment remains challenging, the company continues to focus on capturing
efficiencies, advancing strategic investments, and creating long-term
shareholder value.



 


 


 



 
earnings
in the first nine months of 2016 were $6.2 billion, down $7.2 billion, or 54
percent, from 2015.
 
earnings
per share assuming dilution were $1.47.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $14.5 billion, down 39 percent from 2015.
 
oil-equivalent
production was essentially unchanged at 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per
day, with liquids up 2.6 percent and natural gas down 4.4 percent.
 
the
corporation distributed $9.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.

upstream earnings
were $620 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $738 million from the
third quarter of 2015. lower liquids and gas realizations decreased earnings by
$880 million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million.
all other items, including lower expenses partly offset by unfavorable foreign
exchange effects, increased earnings by $60 million.
 
on an oil-equivalent basis,
production was down compared with the third quarter of 2015. liquids production
totaled 2.2 million barrels per day, down 120,000 barrels per day. higher
downtime, mainly in nigeria, and field decline were partly offset by project
start-ups. natural gas production was 9.6 billion cubic feet per day, up 77
million cubic feet per day from 2015 as project start-ups more than offset
field decline and divestment impacts.
 
u.s. upstream earnings declined
$35 million from the third quarter of 2015 to a loss of $477 million in the
third quarter of 2016. non-u.s. upstream earnings were $1,097 million, down
$703 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream earnings were $838
million, down $5,406 million from the first nine months of 2015. lower
realizations decreased earnings by $5.8 billion. favorable volume and mix
effects increased earnings by $130 million. all other items increased earnings
by $260 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence of
asset management gains.
 
on an oil-equivalent basis,
production of 4 million barrels per day was essentially flat compared to the
same period in 2015. liquids production of 2.4 million barrels per day
increased 59,000 barrels per day, with project start-ups partly offset by field
decline, the canadian wildfires, and downtime mainly in nigeria. natural gas
production of 10 billion cubic feet per day decreased 458 million cubic feet
per day from 2015 as regulatory restrictions in the netherlands, field decline
and divestment impacts were partly offset by project start-ups.
 
u.s.
upstream earnings declined $1,282 million from 2015 to a loss of $1,823 million
in 2016. earnings outside the u.s. were $2,661 million, down $4,124 million
from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions
that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors include, but
are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program
activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime,
market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that
do not affect entitlements.

downstream
earnings were $1,229 million, down $804 million from the third quarter of 2015.
weaker margins, mainly in refining, decreased earnings by $1.6 billion while
favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $170 million. all other
items increased earnings by $580 million, including lower maintenance expenses
and gains from divestments in canada. petroleum product sales of 5.6 million
barrels per day were 203,000 barrels per day lower than the prior year mainly
due to divestment of the torrance, california, and chalmette, louisiana,
refineries. 
 
earnings

items increased earnings by $680 million, mainly reflecting lower maintenance
expense and gains from divestments. petroleum product sales of 5.5 million
barrels per day were 306,000 barrels per day lower than 2015 mainly due to
divestment of the torrance and chalmette refineries.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2016 was $6.3 billion,
including asset sales of $1.0 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion from the comparable
2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $14.7 billion for the first nine months of 2016,
$11.3 billion lower than 2015. the major source of funds was net income
including noncontrolling interests of $6.4 billion, a decrease of $7.4 billion
from the prior year period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $14.2
billion for depreciation and depletion increased by $0.9 billion. changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $2.4 billion in 2016 and
$1.0 billion in 2015. all other items net decreased cash flows by $3.5 billion
in 2016 and had no impact on cash in 2015. for additional details, see the condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2016 used net cash of $10.7 billion, a decrease of
$7.8 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $12.3 billion was $8.1 billion lower than 2015. proceeds
from asset sales of $2.2 billion increased $0.6 billion. additional investment
and advances were $1.4 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion. 
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2016 was $16.9 billion,
including asset sales of $2.2 billion, and decreased $10.7 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
during the first
quarter of 2016, the corporation issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt and
used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used by financing
activities was $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016, $4.9 billion
lower than 2015 reflecting the 2016 debt issuance and a lower level of
purchases of shares of exxonmobil stock in 2016.
  
during the first nine
months of 2016, exxon mobil corporation purchased 9 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.7 billion. these purchases
were made to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and
programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,156 million at year-end to 4,147
million at the end of the third quarter 2016. purchases may be made in both the
open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed to shareholders a total of $9.3 billion in the first nine months of
2016 through dividends. this included $3.1 billion for the third quarter of
2016.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2016 compared to
$4.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2015.


20



 

 
total debt of $46.2
billion compared to $38.7 billion at year-end 2015. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 20.7 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2016
compared to 18.0 percent at year-end 2015.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate

income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $12.8 billion for the third
quarter of 2016, a decrease of $1.9 billion from 2015. income tax expense
decreased by $1.0 billion to $0.3 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 20 percent compared to 32 percent in the prior
year period due to a higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by
$0.9 billion to $12.5 billion as a result of lower sales realizations.

decreased by $4.6 billion to $1.0 billion reflecting lower earnings. the
effective income tax rate was 26 percent compared to 37 percent in the prior

in the united
states, the corporation has various u.s. federal income tax positions at issue
with the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years 2006-2011. the irs has
asserted penalties for all years associated with several of those
positions. the corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense
because, in the corporation’s judgment, the irs should not be able to sustain the
penalties under applicable law. the corporation has filed a refund suit for tax
years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court with respect to the positions
at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with
the irs for 2006-2011 would not have a materially adverse effect on the
corporation’s net income or liquidity. the irs has not completed its audit of
tax years after 2011.

capital and
exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2016
were $4.2 billion, down 45 percent from the third quarter of 2015. 



 


 


 



 
capital and exploration expenditures in the first nine months of
2016 were $14.5 billion, down 39 percent from the first nine months of 2015 due
primarily to lower major project spending. given continuing efficiencies, market
capture, and project selectivity, the corporation anticipates a 2016 investment
level between $20 and $21 billion.
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation. 
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, revenue from contracts with customers.
the standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. the standard is required to be adopted beginning
january 1, 2018. “sales and other operating revenue” on the consolidated
statement of income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales
transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard, revenue will exclude
sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. this change in
reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation continues to evaluate other
areas of the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements. 
 
in february 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, leases. the standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. the standard is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2019. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
critical accounting estimates
 
as disclosed in exxonmobil’s 2015 form
10-k, low crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the corporation’s
reserves as reported under securities and exchange commission (sec) rules.
average year-to-date crude prices have been significantly affected by the very
low prices experienced during the first quarter of 2016, but have recovered
considerably since that time. if the average prices seen during the first nine
months of 2016 persist for the remainder of the year, under the sec definition
of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil, such as those associated with
the kearl oil sands operations in canada, will not qualify as proved reserves
at year-end 2016. in addition, if these average prices persist, the projected
end-of-field-life for estimating reserves will accelerate for certain liquids
and natural gas operations in north america, resulting in a reduction of proved
reserves at year-end 2016. quantities that could be required to be de-booked as
proved reserves on an sec basis amount to approximately 3.6 billion barrels of
bitumen at kearl, and about 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels in other north
america operations. among the factors that would result in these reserves being
re-booked as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in
average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating
efficiencies. under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government
royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributable to
exxonmobil. we do not expect the de-booking of reported proved reserves under
sec definitions to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter
our outlook for future production volumes.

in light of
continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, and as
part of its annual planning and budgeting process which is currently in
progress, the corporation will perform an assessment of its major long-lived
assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in late 2015, including north
america natural gas assets and certain other assets across the remainder of its
operations. the assessment will reflect crude and natural gas price outlooks
consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities
and generally consistent with the long-term price forecasts published by
third-party industry and government experts. development of future undiscounted
cash flow estimates requires significant management judgment, particularly in
cases where an asset’s life is expected to extend decades into the future. an
asset group would be impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows were
less than the asset’s carrying value, and impairment would be measured by the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. the corporation will
complete its asset recoverability assessment and analyze the conclusions of
that assessment in connection with the preparation and review of the
corporation’s year-end financial statements for inclusion in its 2016 form 10-k.
until these activities are complete, it is not practicable to reasonably
estimate the existence or range of potential future impairments related to the
corporation’s long-lived assets.
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; asset
carrying values; reported reserves; resource recoveries; and share purchase
levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil or gas
prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry, including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome
of exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government
regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the impact of fiscal
and commercial terms; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other
factors discussed under the heading "factors affecting future
results" in the “investors” section of our website and in item 1a of
exxonmobil's 2015 form 10-k. closing of pending acquisitions is also
subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent provided in the applicable
agreement. we assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
