earnings of $14.8 billion for the first nine months of 2018
increased 31 percent from $11.3 billion in 2017.
 
earnings per share assuming dilution were $3.47.
 
capital and exploration expenditures were $18.1 billion, up
28 percent from 2017.
 
oil‑equivalent production was 3.8 million barrels per day,
down 5 percent from the prior year. excluding entitlement effects and

upstream earnings were
$4,229 million in the third quarter of 2018, up $2,662 million from
the third quarter of 2017.
·        
 realizations
increased earnings by $2,580 million due to higher liquids and gas
realizations.
·        
 higher
volume and mix effects increased earnings by $50 million. 
·        
 all
other items increased earnings by $30 million including favorable one-time tax
impacts, partly offset by higher production expenses.

year quarter.
·        
 non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $3,623 million, up $1,818 million from the
prior year quarter.
·        
 on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production decreased 2 percent from the
third quarter of 2017.
·        
 liquids
production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, up 6,000 barrels per
day as growth more than offset lower volumes from entitlements, divestments,
decline, and downtime. 
·        
 natural
gas production was 9 billion cubic feet per day, down 584 million
cubic feet per day driven by decline largely in the u.s. aligned with value
focus, lower volumes from divestments and lower demand. 



 


 


 



 
upstream earnings were
$10,766 million in the first nine months of 2018, up $5,763 million from the
first nine months of 2017.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the ongoing
nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is useful
for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with
cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2018 was $12.6 billion,
including asset sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion from the
comparable 2017 period primarily reflecting higher earnings and favorable
working capital effects.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $27.4 billion for the first nine months of 2018, $4.8
billion higher than 2017. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $15.2 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $13.7 billion
for depreciation and depletion was down $0.3 billion from 2017. changes in
operational working capital were essentially flat, compared to a decrease of
$0.5 billion in the prior year period. all other items net decreased cash flows
by $1.5 billion in 2018 versus a reduction of $2.3 billion in 2017. see the
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for additional details. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2018 used net cash of $10.9 billion, an increase
of $1.7 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $13.5 billion was $2.6 billion higher than 2017.
proceeds from asset sales of $3.2 billion increased $1.5 billion. investments
and advances decreased $0.8 billion, principally reflecting the absence of the
deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration payable
as a result of the acquisition of interoil corporation in 2017. this was partly
offset by cash outflows in 2018 related to the acquisition of a downstream
business in indonesia.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2018 was $30.6 billion,
including asset sales of $3.2 billion, an increase of $6.3 billion from the
comparable 2017 period primarily reflecting higher earnings and increased asset
sale proceeds.
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $13.9 billion in the first nine months of 2018, an
increase of $0.7 billion from 2017. the net reduction in short and long term
debt was $2.7 billion compared to $2.8 billion in 2017. 
 
during the first nine
months of 2018, exxon mobil corporation purchased 5 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.4 billion. these purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding decreased
from 4,239 million at year-end to 4,234 million at the end of the third quarter
of 2018. purchases may be made both in the open market and through negotiated
transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time
without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $10.3 billion to shareholders in the first nine months
of 2018 through dividends.



21



 

total cash and cash equivalents of $5.7 billion at the
end of the third quarter of 2018 compared to $3.2 billion at year-end 2017.
 
total debt at the end
of the third quarter of 2018 was $40 billion compared to $42.3 billion at
year-end 2017. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 16.9 percent
at the end of the third quarter of 2018 compared to 17.9 percent at year-end
2017.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial
requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s
common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

(1) includes “other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are
included in “production and manufacturing expenses” and “selling, general and
administrative expenses.”
 
total taxes were $11.6 billion for the third quarter of 2018,
an increase of $1.8 billion from 2017. income tax expense increased by $1.1
billion to $2.6 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the effective income
tax rate was 34 percent compared to 33 percent in the prior year period. this
increase mainly reflects a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions,
partly offset by the impact of favorable one-time tax items. total other taxes
and duties increased by $0.7 billion to $8.9 billion.
 
total taxes were $34.4 billion for the first nine months of
2018, an increase of $6.3 billion from 2017. income tax expense increased by $3.4
billion to $7.6 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the effective income
tax rate was 39 percent compared to 34 percent in the prior year period due to
a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. total other taxes and
duties increased by $2.9 billion to $26.8 billion.
 
non-u.s. upstream earnings included a $270 million tax
credit resulting from an updated estimate of the impact of u.s. tax reform and
from clarifications provided in proposed transition tax regulations issued by
the treasury in the third quarter of 2018. the adjustment restores a portion of
the u.s. tax reform deferred income tax expense reported in the non-u.s.
upstream segment in the fourth quarter of 2017. there were no other significant
changes during the first nine months of 2018 to the corporation’s reasonable
estimates of the income tax effects reflected in 2017 for the changes in tax
law and tax rate from u.s. tax reform and following guidance outlined in the
sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118. the impact of tax law changes on the
corporation’s financial statements could differ from its estimates due to
further analysis of the new law, regulatory guidance, technical corrections
legislation, guidance under u.s. gaap, or other considerations. if significant
changes occur, the corporation will provide updated information in connection
with its form 10-k for 2018.
 
in the united states, the corporation has various ongoing
u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with the internal revenue service
(irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has asserted penalties
associated with several of those positions. the corporation has not recognized
the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not expect the
penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has filed a
refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court with
respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution of
all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse effect
on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

capital and
exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2018 were $6.6 billion, up 10
percent from the third quarter of 2017.



 


 


 



 
capital and exploration expenditures in the first nine months of 2018
were $18.1 billion, up 28 percent from the first nine months of 2017 due
primarily to increased u.s. drilling activity and acreage acquisitions in
brazil. the corporation anticipates an investment level of approximately $25
billion in 2018. actual spending could vary depending on the progress of
individual projects and property acquisitions. 



in 2013 and
2014, the corporation and rosneft established various entities to conduct
exploration and research activities. in 2014, the european union and united
states imposed sanctions relating to the russian energy sector. exxonmobil
continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory licenses applicable to
its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation. see part ii. other information,
item 1. legal proceedings in this report for information concerning a civil
penalty assessment related to this matter which the corporation is contesting.
the corporation withdrew from the aforementioned joint ventures with rosneft,
effective april 30, 2018.



the
groningen field is operated by nederlandse aardolie maatschappij (nam), a
netherlands company owned 50 percent by affiliates of the corporation. nam has
a 60 percent interest in the groningen field. on march 29, 2018, the dutch
cabinet notified parliament of its intention to further reduce previously
legislated groningen gas extraction in response to seismic events over the last
several years. affiliates of the corporation and their partners have actively
been in discussions with the government on the associated implementation
measures which resulted in a signed heads of agreement (hoa – agreement on
principles) on june 25, 2018 and the execution of additional implementation
agreements in september. in anticipation of a lower production outlook, the
corporation has reduced its estimate of proved reserves by 0.8 billion
oil-equivalent barrels. in addition, the seismic activity has yielded various
claims. where losses are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities have
been recorded. the corporation does not expect these matters to have a material
effect on the corporation’s operations or financial condition. while the future
production profile and other considerations related to the groningen field
could vary depending on a wide variety of factors, reduced gas extraction in
the future is expected to result in lower reported production, earnings and
cash flows than in recent years for the corporation’s share of nam.



recently issued accounting standards
 
effective january 1, 2019, exxonmobil will adopt the financial
accounting standards board’s standard, leases (topic 842), as amended.
the standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year to
be recorded on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability.
we expect to use a transition method that applies the new lease standard at
january 1, 2019, and recognizes any cumulative-effect adjustments to the
opening balance of 2019 retained earnings. 
 
the corporation acquired lease accounting
software to facilitate implementation, and is currently configuring and testing
the software. based on leases outstanding at the end of 2017, the corporation
estimates the operating lease right of use asset and lease liability would have
been in the range of $4 billion to
$5 billion at
that time. the effect on the corporation’s balance sheet as a result of
implementing the standard on january 1, 2019, could differ considerably
depending on operating leases commenced in 2018 as well as interest rates and
other factors such as the expiry or renewal of leases
during the year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2018 was $12.6 billion,
including asset sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion from the
comparable 2017 period primarily reflecting higher earnings and favorable
working capital effects.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $27.4 billion for the first nine months of 2018, $4.8
billion higher than 2017. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $15.2 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $13.7 billion
for depreciation and depletion was down $0.3 billion from 2017. changes in
operational working capital were essentially flat, compared to a decrease of
$0.5 billion in the prior year period. all other items net decreased cash flows
by $1.5 billion in 2018 versus a reduction of $2.3 billion in 2017. see the
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for additional details. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2018 used net cash of $10.9 billion, an increase
of $1.7 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $13.5 billion was $2.6 billion higher than 2017.
proceeds from asset sales of $3.2 billion increased $1.5 billion. investments
and advances decreased $0.8 billion, principally reflecting the absence of the
deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration payable
as a result of the acquisition of interoil corporation in 2017. this was partly
offset by cash outflows in 2018 related to the acquisition of a downstream
business in indonesia.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first nine months of 2018 was $30.6 billion,
including asset sales of $3.2 billion, an increase of $6.3 billion from the

requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in

opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s
common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

(1) includes “other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are
included in “production and manufacturing expenses” and “selling, general and
administrative expenses.”
 
total taxes were $11.6 billion for the third quarter of 2018,
an increase of $1.8 billion from 2017. income tax expense increased by $1.1
billion to $2.6 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the effective income
tax rate was 34 percent compared to 33 percent in the prior year period. this
increase mainly reflects a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions,
partly offset by the impact of favorable one-time tax items. total other taxes
and duties increased by $0.7 billion to $8.9 billion.
 
total taxes were $34.4 billion for the first nine months of
2018, an increase of $6.3 billion from 2017. income tax expense increased by $3.4
billion to $7.6 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the effective income
tax rate was 39 percent compared to 34 percent in the prior year period due to
a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. total other taxes and
duties increased by $2.9 billion to $26.8 billion.
 
non-u.s. upstream earnings included a $270 million tax
credit resulting from an updated estimate of the impact of u.s. tax reform and
from clarifications provided in proposed transition tax regulations issued by
the treasury in the third quarter of 2018. the adjustment restores a portion of
the u.s. tax reform deferred income tax expense reported in the non-u.s.
upstream segment in the fourth quarter of 2017. there were no other significant
changes during the first nine months of 2018 to the corporation’s reasonable
estimates of the income tax effects reflected in 2017 for the changes in tax
law and tax rate from u.s. tax reform and following guidance outlined in the
sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118. the impact of tax law changes on the
corporation’s financial statements could differ from its estimates due to
further analysis of the new law, regulatory guidance, technical corrections
legislation, guidance under u.s. gaap, or other considerations. if significant
changes occur, the corporation will provide updated information in connection
with its form 10-k for 2018.
 
in the united states, the corporation has various ongoing
u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with the internal revenue service
(irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has asserted penalties
associated with several of those positions. the corporation has not recognized
the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not expect the
penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has filed a
refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court with
respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution of
all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse effect
on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

capital and
exploration expenditures in the third quarter of 2018 were $6.6 billion, up 10
percent from the third quarter of 2017.



 


 


 



 
capital and exploration expenditures in the first nine months of 2018
were $18.1 billion, up 28 percent from the first nine months of 2017 due
primarily to increased u.s. drilling activity and acreage acquisitions in
brazil. the corporation anticipates an investment level of approximately $25
billion in 2018. actual spending could vary depending on the progress of
individual projects and property acquisitions. 



in 2013 and
2014, the corporation and rosneft established various entities to conduct
exploration and research activities. in 2014, the european union and united
states imposed sanctions relating to the russian energy sector. exxonmobil
continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory licenses applicable to
its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation. see part ii. other information,
item 1. legal proceedings in this report for information concerning a civil
penalty assessment related to this matter which the corporation is contesting.
the corporation withdrew from the aforementioned joint ventures with rosneft,
effective april 30, 2018.



the
groningen field is operated by nederlandse aardolie maatschappij (nam), a
netherlands company owned 50 percent by affiliates of the corporation. nam has
a 60 percent interest in the groningen field. on march 29, 2018, the dutch
cabinet notified parliament of its intention to further reduce previously
legislated groningen gas extraction in response to seismic events over the last
several years. affiliates of the corporation and their partners have actively
been in discussions with the government on the associated implementation
measures which resulted in a signed heads of agreement (hoa – agreement on
principles) on june 25, 2018 and the execution of additional implementation
agreements in september. in anticipation of a lower production outlook, the
corporation has reduced its estimate of proved reserves by 0.8 billion
oil-equivalent barrels. in addition, the seismic activity has yielded various
claims. where losses are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities have
been recorded. the corporation does not expect these matters to have a material
effect on the corporation’s operations or financial condition. while the future
production profile and other considerations related to the groningen field
could vary depending on a wide variety of factors, reduced gas extraction in
the future is expected to result in lower reported production, earnings and
cash flows than in recent years for the corporation’s share of nam.



recently issued accounting standards
 
effective january 1, 2019, exxonmobil will adopt the financial
accounting standards board’s standard, leases (topic 842), as amended.
the standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year to
be recorded on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability.
we expect to use a transition method that applies the new lease standard at
january 1, 2019, and recognizes any cumulative-effect adjustments to the
opening balance of 2019 retained earnings. 
 
the corporation acquired lease accounting
software to facilitate implementation, and is currently configuring and testing
the software. based on leases outstanding at the end of 2017, the corporation
estimates the operating lease right of use asset and lease liability would have
been in the range of $4 billion to
$5 billion at
that time. the effect on the corporation’s balance sheet as a result of
implementing the standard on january 1, 2019, could differ considerably
depending on operating leases commenced in 2018 as well as interest rates and
other factors such as the expiry or renewal of leases
during the year.
