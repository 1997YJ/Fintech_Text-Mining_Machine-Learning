(mobileye). we expect the transaction to close during q3 2017, pending satisfaction of all closing conditions. we intend to fund the acquisition with cash and proceeds from the sale of assets within our investment portfolio held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries.  * data-centric businesses include dcg, internet of things group (iotg), nsg, programmable solutions group (psg), and all other. 31intel

platforms. additionally, revenue increased from our higher nsg revenue and ccg non-platform revenue. the increase in revenue was offset by $537 million from the q2 2017 divestiture of isecg. our net revenue for the first six months of 2017 increased by $2.3 billion, or 9%, compared to the first six months of 2016, which reflected an extra workweek. the higher revenue was driven by higher platform average selling prices, up 7%, and platform unit sales, primarily from our notebook and dcg platforms. additionally, revenue increased from higher nsg and ccg non-platform revenue. the increase in

include investments as shown in the preceding liquidity and capital resources table. most of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. this amount includes an increase of $5.0 billion in the authorization limit approved by our board of directors in april 2017. no commercial paper remained outstanding as of july 1, 2017. in q2 2017, we issued a total of $7.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes for general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing of outstanding debt or repurchases of shares of our common stock. as of july 1, 2017, $17.0 billion of our $25.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $17.0 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $3.0 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of july 1, 2017. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.during q1 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mobileye. pursuant to the terms of the agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of intel commenced a tender offer on april 5, 2017 to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing a fully-diluted equity value of approximately $15.3 billion as of the date of the agreement. the transaction is expected to close during q3 2017, pending satisfaction of all closing conditions. we intend to fund the acquisition with cash and proceeds from the sale of assets within our investment portfolio held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries.  during q2 2017, we completed the divestiture of our isecg business for total consideration of $4.2 billion. the consideration included cash proceeds of $924 million and $2.2 billion in the form of promissory notes. the notes are classified as a loan receivable. the notes accrue interest quarterly at an interest rate of three-month libor plus 7.0% per annum and mature in 2020, but may be repaid early without penalty. the interest rate will escalate in q1 2018 and every three months thereafter by 0.5% per annum. additionally, mcafee may borrow $250 million on a line of credit provided by intel. the line of credit will be closed when the notes are repaid. subsequent to the end of q2 2017, we gave notice of our intention to redeem the $1.0 billion, 4.90% senior notes due august 2045. the redemption date is august 11, 2017.39intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.in summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:  six months ended(in millions) jul 1, 2017 jul 2, 2016net cash provided by operating
