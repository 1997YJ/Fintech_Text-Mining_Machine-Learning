review of first quarter 2017 results 
 
exxonmobil’s first
quarter 2017 earnings were $4 billion, or $0.95 per diluted share,
compared with $1.8 billion a year earlier, resulting from improvements in commodity
prices, cost management and refining operations.
 
financial results
reflect an increase in commodity prices and highlight our continued focus on
controlling costs and operating efficiently. the corporation continues to make
strategic acquisitions, advance key initiatives and fund long-term growth
projects across the value chain.

upstream earnings
were $2,252 million, compared to a loss of $76 million in the first
quarter of 2016. higher liquids and gas realizations increased earnings by $2.3 billion.
lower volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $150 million. all other
items increased earnings by $170 million primarily as a result of lower
expenses.
 
on an oil-equivalent
basis, production decreased 4 percent from the first quarter of 2016. liquids
production of 2.3 million barrels per day decreased 205,000 barrels
per day due to lower entitlements and higher maintenance activity mainly in
canada and nigeria. natural gas production of 10.9 billion cubic feet per
day increased 184 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp‑up
was partly offset by field decline.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field spending
patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can also
include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime,
market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that
do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2017 was $8.9 billion,
including asset sales of $0.7 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $8.2 billion for the first quarter of 2017, $3.4
billion higher than 2016. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $4.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the non-cash provision of $4.5 billion
for depreciation and depletion decreased by $0.2 billion. changes in
operational working capital increased cash flows by $0.8 billion in 2017 versus
a reduction of $0.4 billion in 2016. all other items net decreased cash flows
by $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to a reduction of $1.3 billion in 2016. for
additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on
page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first quarter of 2017 used net cash of $3.8 billion, a decrease of $0.6
billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property, plant
and equipment of $2.9 billion was $1.7 billion lower than 2016. proceeds from
asset sales of $0.7 billion increased $0.5 billion. additional investments and
advances were $1.7 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, and reflect the
deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration payable
as a result of the acquisition of interoil corporation. 
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017, compared to
net cash provided of $0.5 billion in 2016. the net addition to short and long
term debt was $0.4 billion in 2017 compared to $4.3 billion in 2016.
  
during the first
quarter of 2017, exxon mobil corporation purchased 6 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.5 billion. these purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding increased
from 4,148 million at year-end to 4,237 million at the end of the first quarter
of 2017, mainly due to shares issued for the acquisitions of interoil
corporation and of companies that hold acreage in the permian basin. purchases
may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $3.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter of
2017 through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2017 compared to
$4.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
 
total debt at the end
of the first quarter of 2017 was $43.6 billion compared to $42.8 billion at
year-end 2016. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 19.2 percent
at the end of the first quarter of 2017 compared to 19.7 percent at year-end
2016.

the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income, sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled
$14.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.6 billion from
2016. income tax expense increased by $1.9 billion to $1.8 billion reflecting
higher pre-tax income. the effective income tax rate was 38 percent compared to
19 percent in the prior year period due to a higher share of earnings in higher
tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other
taxes and duties increased by $0.7 billion to $12.2 billion as a result of
higher sales realizations.
 
in the united states, the corporation has various ongoing
u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with the internal revenue service
(irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has asserted penalties
associated with several of those positions. the corporation has not recognized
the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not expect the
penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has filed a
refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court with
respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution of
all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse effect
on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

anticipates an investment level of $22 billion in 2017. actual spending could
vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.

in 2014, the european union and united states imposed
sanctions relating to the russian energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply
with all sanctions and regulatory licenses applicable to its affiliates’
investments in the russian federation. 
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in
may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue
from contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. “sales and other operating
revenue” on the consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard,
revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties.
this change in reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation expects to
adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method, under which prior
years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of
the new standard is provided for 2018 results. the corporation continues to
evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to have a material
effect on the corporation’s financial statements. 
in
february 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, leases.
the standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be
recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. exxonmobil is
evaluating the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements and plans to adopt it in 2019. 
in march 2017, the financial accounting
standards board issued an accounting standards update, compensation –
retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic
pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the update
requires that the service cost component of net benefit costs be reported in
the same line in the income statement as other compensation costs and that the
other components of net benefit costs be presented separately from the service
cost component. additionally, only the service cost component of net benefit
costs will be eligible for capitalization. the update is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2018. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; asset
carrying values; reported reserves; resource recoveries; and share purchase
levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil or gas
prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry, including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome
of exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government
regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the impact of fiscal
and commercial terms; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other
factors discussed under the heading "factors affecting future
results" in the “investors” section of our website and in item 1a of
exxonmobil's 2016 form 10-k. closing of pending acquisitions is also
subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent provided in the applicable
agreement. we assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.

divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime,
market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that
do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2017 was $8.9 billion,
including asset sales of $0.7 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $8.2 billion for the first quarter of 2017, $3.4
billion higher than 2016. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $4.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the non-cash provision of $4.5 billion
for depreciation and depletion decreased by $0.2 billion. changes in
operational working capital increased cash flows by $0.8 billion in 2017 versus
a reduction of $0.4 billion in 2016. all other items net decreased cash flows
by $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to a reduction of $1.3 billion in 2016. for
additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on
page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first quarter of 2017 used net cash of $3.8 billion, a decrease of $0.6
billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property, plant
and equipment of $2.9 billion was $1.7 billion lower than 2016. proceeds from
asset sales of $0.7 billion increased $0.5 billion. additional investments and
advances were $1.7 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, and reflect the
deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration payable
as a result of the acquisition of interoil corporation. 
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017, compared to
net cash provided of $0.5 billion in 2016. the net addition to short and long
term debt was $0.4 billion in 2017 compared to $4.3 billion in 2016.
  
during the first
quarter of 2017, exxon mobil corporation purchased 6 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.5 billion. these purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding increased
from 4,148 million at year-end to 4,237 million at the end of the first quarter
of 2017, mainly due to shares issued for the acquisitions of interoil
corporation and of companies that hold acreage in the permian basin. purchases
may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $3.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter of
2017 through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2017 compared to
$4.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
 
total debt at the end
of the first quarter of 2017 was $43.6 billion compared to $42.8 billion at
year-end 2016. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 19.2 percent
at the end of the first quarter of 2017 compared to 19.7 percent at year-end
2016.

the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income, sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled
$14.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.6 billion from
2016. income tax expense increased by $1.9 billion to $1.8 billion reflecting
higher pre-tax income. the effective income tax rate was 38 percent compared to
19 percent in the prior year period due to a higher share of earnings in higher
tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other
taxes and duties increased by $0.7 billion to $12.2 billion as a result of
higher sales realizations.
 
in the united states, the corporation has various ongoing
u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with the internal revenue service
(irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has asserted penalties
associated with several of those positions. the corporation has not recognized
the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not expect the
penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has filed a
refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court with
respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution of
all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse effect
on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

in 2014, the european union and united states imposed
sanctions relating to the russian energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply
with all sanctions and regulatory licenses applicable to its affiliates’
investments in the russian federation. 
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in
may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue
from contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. “sales and other operating
revenue” on the consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard,
revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties.
this change in reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation expects to
adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method, under which prior
years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of
the new standard is provided for 2018 results. the corporation continues to
evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to have a material
effect on the corporation’s financial statements. 
in
february 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, leases.
the standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be
recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. exxonmobil is
evaluating the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements and plans to adopt it in 2019. 
in march 2017, the financial accounting
standards board issued an accounting standards update, compensation –
retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic
pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the update
requires that the service cost component of net benefit costs be reported in
the same line in the income statement as other compensation costs and that the
other components of net benefit costs be presented separately from the service
cost component. additionally, only the service cost component of net benefit
costs will be eligible for capitalization. the update is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2018. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; asset
carrying values; reported reserves; resource recoveries; and share purchase
levels, could differ materially due to factors including: changes in oil or gas
prices or other market or economic conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry, including the scope and duration of economic recessions; the outcome
of exploration and development efforts; changes in law or government
regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the impact of fiscal
and commercial terms; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other
factors discussed under the heading "factors affecting future
results" in the “investors” section of our website and in item 1a of
exxonmobil's 2016 form 10-k. closing of pending acquisitions is also
subject to satisfaction of the conditions precedent provided in the applicable
agreement. we assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
