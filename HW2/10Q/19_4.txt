("compact power"), a leading national provider of equipment rental and maintenance services, to enhance our portfolio of service offerings to our professional customers. also in the first six months of fiscal 2017, we completed the roll out of interline brands, inc.'s ("interline") product catalog to our stores and continued the roll out of the capability to accept payment in our stores that is linked to existing interline customer accounts. product authority – product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. we strive to be the leader in product authority, connecting products and services to the needs of our customers. in the first six months of fiscal 2017, our merchants continued to collaborate with our suppliers to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation – we drive productivity and efficiency through continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain. further, our disciplined capital allocation builds shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. in the first six months of fiscal 2017, we continued to optimize the flow of products from suppliers to shelves and to our customers’ locations through project sync. this multi-year supply chain program is designed to create an end-to-end solution that will benefit all participants in our supply chain. we plan to continue to innovate our business model and value chain to support our productivity cycle and enhance overall value for customers throughout the year.in february 2017, our board of directors increased our targeted dividend payout ratio to 55% of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016. also in february 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. under the program, we repurchased a total of 17.3 million shares for $2.6 billion through an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement and the open market during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.we opened one new store in the u.s. during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, for a total store count of 2,282 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017, a total of 302 of our stores, or 13.2%, were located in canada and mexico.we generated $7.9 billion of cash flow from operations in the first six months of fiscal 2017. this cash flow, along with $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the first six months of fiscal 2017, was used to fund cash payments of $3.9 billion for share repurchases, pay $2.1 billion of dividends, fund $846 million in capital expenditures and repay $710 million of short-term debt.our inventory turnover ratio was 5.3 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 5.2 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016. our return on invested capital (defined as net operating profit after tax, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt,

reconciliation of net operating profit after tax to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure, and our calculation of return on invested capital, see "non-gaap financial measures" below.13table of contentswe believe the percentage relationship between net sales and the major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of

$26.5 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, net sales increased 5.6% to $52.0 billion from $49.2 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2016. the increase in net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017 primarily reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth. the increase in net sales was partially offset by pressure from foreign currency fluctuations, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $64 million and $135 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively.total comparable store sales increased 6.3% and 6.0% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively, which reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017. comparable store sales for our lumber, electrical, tools, flooring, building materials, appliances, indoor garden and décor product categories were above the company average for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. further, our comparable store average ticket increased 3.6% and 3.8% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances and flooring, offset in part by pressure from foreign currency fluctuations. our comparable store customer transactions increased 2.6% and 2.1% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively. gross profit increased 6.0% to $9.5 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from $8.9 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, gross profit increased 5.4% to $17.6 billion from $16.7 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2016. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.7% for the second quarter of both fiscal 2017 and 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, gross profit margin was 33.9% compared to 34.0% for the first six months of fiscal 2016. gross profit margin for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017 reflects the impact of product mix changes and higher shrink, offset by benefits from our supply chain driven by increased productivity.selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 3.7% to $4.5 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from $4.4 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, sg&a increased 2.8% to $8.9 billion from $8.7 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2016. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 16.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 16.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 17.1% compared to 17.6% for the first six months of fiscal 2016. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and continued expense control.depreciation and amortization increased 3.0% to $449 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from $436 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, depreciation and amortization increased 2.8% to $893 million from $869 million for the first six months of fiscal 2016. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.6% for the second quarter of both fiscal 2017 and 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.7% compared to 1.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2016. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.operating income increased 8.8% to $4.5 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from $4.1 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, operating income increased 8.8% to $7.8 billion from $7.2 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2016. operating income as a percent of net sales was 15.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 15.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, operating income as a percent of net sales was 15.0% compared to 14.6% for the first six months of fiscal 2016.interest and other, net, was $249 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $228 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, interest and other, net, was $490 million compared to $465 million for the first six months of fiscal 2016. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.9% for the second quarter and first six months of both fiscal 2017 and 2016.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.0% for the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared to 36.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2016. the effective income tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2017 reflects an $85 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for share-based payment awards as a result of the adoption of asu no. 2016-09.diluted earnings per share were $2.25 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $1.97 for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, diluted earnings per share were $3.91 compared to $3.40 for the first six months of fiscal 2016. diluted earnings per share for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017 included benefits of $0.02 and $0.07, respectively, as a result of the adoption of asu no. 2016-09.15table of contentsnon-gaap financial measuresto provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.return on invested capitalwe believe return on invested capital ("roic") is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. we define roic as net operating profit after tax ("nopat"), a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. the following table provides our roic calculation and reconciles nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial

and equity.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. for the first six months of fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.9 billion compared to $6.9 billion for the same period of fiscal 2016. this increase was primarily due to a $442 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage, $307 million more in cash related to the effective management of merchandise inventories and a $160 million increase in cash related to deferred revenue. net cash used in investing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $1.1 billion compared to $674 million for the same period of fiscal 2016. this change was primarily due to $268 million in payments for businesses acquired, net, related to the acquisition of compact power and a $149 million increase in capital expenditures.net cash used in financing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $4.6 billion compared to $4.4 billion for the same period of fiscal 2016. this change was primarily due to $1.5 billion more in repurchases of common stock, $412 million more in cash dividends paid to stockholders and $360 million more in repayments of short-term debt, partially offset by $2.0 billion more in net incremental long-term debt issued in the first six months of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period of fiscal 2016.in june 2017, we issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due june 5, 2020; $750 million of 1.80% senior notes due june 5, 2020 at a discount of $1 million; and $750 million of 3.90% senior notes due june 15, 2047 at a discount of $5 million (together, the “june 2017 issuance”). the net proceeds of the june 2017 issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, 16table of contentsincluding repurchases of shares of our common stock. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into an asr agreement under which we paid $1.65 billion to a third party financial institution and received a total of 10.8 million shares. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in december 2019 and contains various customary covenants. at july 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. during the first six months of fiscal 2017, all of our short-term borrowings were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $1.0 billion. as of july 30, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.as of july 30, 2017, we had $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.recent accounting pronouncementsfor a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements which may be applicable to us, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.on january 30, 2017, we adopted asu no. 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment
