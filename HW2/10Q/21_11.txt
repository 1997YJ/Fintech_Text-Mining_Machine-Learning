item 2.  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe following discussion and analysis supplements management's discussion and analysis of mastercard incorporated for the year ended december 31, 2014 as contained in the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 13, 2015.  it also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated (together, “mastercard” or the “company”), included elsewhere in this report.  for the three months ended march 31, 2014, contra revenue and general and administrative expenses were revised to correctly classify $5 million of customer incentive expenses as contra revenue instead of general and administrative expenses.  this revision had no impact on net income.  percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.overview mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  as the operator of what we believe is the world’s fastest payments network, we facilitate the processing of payment transactions, including authorization, clearing and settlement, and deliver related products and services.  we make payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including mastercard, maestro and cirrus.  we also provide value-added offerings such as loyalty and reward programs, information services and consulting.  our network is designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.  a typical transaction on our network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder, merchant, issuer (the cardholder’s financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).  we do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our branded cards.  in most cases, cardholder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution customers.we generate revenue by charging fees to issuers and acquirers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services, as well as by assessing these customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or gross dollar volume (“gdv”), on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.our strategyour ability to grow our business is influenced by personal consumption expenditure growth, driving cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment, increasing our share in electronic payments and providing value-added products and services.  we drive growth by growing, diversifying and building our business.grow.  we focus on growing our core businesses globally, including growing our credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions and increasing the number of payment transactions we process.diversify.  we look to diversify our business by seeking new areas of growth in new and existing markets around the world.  we focus on:•diversifying our customer base by working with partners such as governments and digital and mobile providers;•encouraging use of our products and solutions in areas that provide new opportunities for electronic payments, such as transit and person-to-person transfers;•driving acceptance at small merchants and merchants who have not historically accepted mastercard products; and •broadening financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked.build.  we build our business by:•taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the ongoing convergence of the physical and digital worlds; and •using our safety and security products and solutions, data analytics and loyalty solutions to add value.we build and diversify our business through a combination of organic growth and investments, including acquisitions.  22table of contentsstrategic partners.  we work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, increase revenues and fight fraud.  we partner with large digital and mobile providers and telecommunication companies to support their digital payment solutions with our technology, expertise and security protocols.  we help national and local governments drive increased financial inclusion and efficiency, reduce costs, increase transparency to reduce crime and corruption and advance social programs.  for consumers, we provide better, safer and more convenient ways to pay.  we provide financial institutions with solutions to help them increase revenue and increase preference for their mastercard-branded products.we recorded net income of $1.0 billion, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus net income of $870 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for the three months ended march 31, 2014.  net income grew 17% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, driven by higher net revenue and an improved effective tax rate, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation and the impact from acquisitions.  acquisitions had a negative impact to net income growth of 2 percentage points for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, or $(0.02) per diluted share for the three months ended march 31, 2015.    our net revenue increased 3% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, primarily driven by increases across our revenue categories, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.  acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth for the three months ended march 31, 2015.  for the three months ended march 31, 2015, our processed transactions increased 12% versus the comparable period in 2014.  our volumes also increased 12% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 on a local currency basis versus the comparable period in 2014. operating expenses decreased 1% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses as a result of gains associated with foreign exchange activity for derivative contracts and balance sheet remeasurement, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency translation.  acquisitions had a negative impact of 9 percentage points to the operating expense change for the three months ended march 31, 2015.  we generated net cash flows from operations of $911 million for the three months ended march 31, 2015, compared to $568 million for the comparable period in 2014.the following table provides a summary of our operating results for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014: three months ended march 31, percent increase

generated in the united states was 38% and 40% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014.  no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total revenue in any such period, but differences in market growth, economic health 23table of contentsand foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time.  while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate.  certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  in addition, further political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  as a result, our revenue may be negatively impacted, or the company may be impacted in several ways.  mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry.  notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business.  for a full discussion see, “risk factors - business risks” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014.in addition, our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries.  regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry.  for further discussion, see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and our risk factors in “risk factors - legal and regulatory risks” in part i, item 1a (risk factors) of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014.  further, information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years.  although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future.  see our risk factor in “risk factors - business risks” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014 related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks. impact of foreign currency ratesour overall operating results can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real.  the functional currency of mastercard europe, our principal european operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real.  accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the u.s. dollar.  for the three months ended march 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, the u.s. dollar strengthened against both the euro and the brazilian real.  for the three months ended march 31, 2015, the euro and the brazilian real devalued by 18% and 17%, respectively, versus the comparable period in 2014.  the net foreign currency impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real negatively impacted net income and net revenue by 7 percentage points and 5 percentage points, respectively, and operating expenses were favorably impacted by 4 percentage points for the three months ended march 31, 2015.in addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives.  in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus primarily non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies.  the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis.  for the three months ended march 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, gdv on a u.s. dollar converted basis increased 2% while gdv grew on a local currency basis 12%.  the company attempts to manage the impact from these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.24table of contentsthe company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation.  while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis, they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the u.s. dollar.financial resultsrevenuerevenue descriptionmastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders’ financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions).  our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services.  our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers.  our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers.  our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following:•domestic or cross-border transactions;•signature-based or pin-based transactions;•geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs;•volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates;•processed or not processed by mastercard;•amount of usage of our other products or services; and•amount of rebates and incentives provided to customers.the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories:1.domestic assessments: domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same.  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.2.cross-border volume fees: cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different.  in general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.3.transaction processing fees: transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions.  transaction processing fees include charges to issuers for the following:•transaction switching fees for the following products and services:◦authorization is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval.  in certain circumstances such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer approve in accordance with either the issuer’s instructions or applicable rules (also known as “stand-in”).◦clearing is the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.◦settlement is facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.25table of contents•connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages.  these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company’s network.4.other revenues: other revenues consist of other payment-related products and services and are primarily associated with the following:•consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company’s professional advisory services group.•fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions.  this includes fees for warning bulletins provided to issuers and acquirers either electronically or in paper form.•loyalty and rewards solution fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with mastercard-branded cards, such as insurance, assistance for lost cards, locating atms and rewards programs.•program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.•the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related products and services, including account and transaction enhancement services, rules compliance and publications.5.rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue.revenue analysisin the three months ended march 31, 2015, gross revenue increased $201 million, or 7%, versus the comparable period in 2014.  gross revenue growth in the three months ended march 31, 2015 was driven by an increase in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, transactions, other payment-related products and services and the impact of acquisitions.  rebates and incentives, in the three months ended march 31, 2015, increased $143 million, or 19%, respectively, versus the comparable period in 2014 primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.  our net revenue increased 3% for the three months ended march 31, 2015, versus the comparable period in 2014.  for the three months ended march 31, 2015, acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points while foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 5 percentage points to net revenue growth.  during the three months ended march 31, 2015, our gdv increased 12% on a local currency basis while our processed transactions increased 12%, respectively.the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth: three

be terminated in a variety of circumstances.   see our risk factor in “risk factor - business risks” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31,

acquisitions contributed 13 percentage points of growth to the 2015 activity.  additionally there are impacts from consulting fees, fraud service fees and other payment-related products and services.4 includes the impact from timing of new, renewed and expired agreements.operating expensesour operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and marketing and depreciation and amortization expenses.  operating expenses decreased $8 million, or 1%, for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses as a result of gains associated with foreign exchange activity for derivative contracts and balance sheet remeasurement, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency translation.  for the three months ended march 31, 2015 acquisitions had a negative impact of 9 percentage points while foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 4 percentage points on the operating expenses change.  the components of operating expenses for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: three months ended march 31, percent increase

three months ended march 31, 2015 decreased $15 million, or 2%, versus the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to gains associated with foreign exchange activity for derivative contracts and balance sheet remeasurement, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency translation.  for the three months ended march 31, 2015 acquisitions had a negative impact of 10 percentage points while foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 3 percentage points on the general and administrative expenses change.  the significant components of our general and administrative expenses for

increased for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in the number of employees from our acquired businesses, partially offset by improved expense controls.•professional fees consist primarily of third-party services, legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and the evaluation of regulatory developments that impact our industry and brand. •data processing and telecommunication expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other telecommunication systems.  these expenses increased due to capacity growth of our business.•foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  see note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.  since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize.  the increase for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, primarily relates to gains on derivative contracts due to foreign exchange rate movements and gains from the balance sheet remeasurement related to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar.•other expenses include costs to provide loyalty and rewards programs, travel and meeting expenses and rental expense for our facilities.  other expenses increased for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the impact of our acquisitions and expenses incurred to support strategic development efforts.advertising and marketingour brands, principally mastercard, are valuable strategic assets that drive acceptance and usage of our products and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally.  our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotions, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale.  we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences.  advertising and marketing expenses decreased slightly for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014, mainly due to foreign currency translation and timing of media spend and sponsorship promotions to support our strategic initiatives.depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expenses increased $14 million, or 18% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 versus the comparable period in 2014.  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs associated with our acquisitions.28table of contentsother income (expense)other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses.  total other expense for the three months ended march 31, 2015 increased primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in march 2014 versus the comparable period in 2014.income taxes the effective income tax rates were 23.9% and 32.0% for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  for the three months ended march 31, 2015, the effective tax rate was lower than the effective tax rate for the comparable period in 2014, due to the recognition of a discrete benefit relating to certain foreign taxes becoming eligible to be claimed as credits in the united states, a larger repatriation benefit and a more favorable mix of taxable earnings.during the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the u.s.  this initiative resulted in a one-time taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom.  we believe this improved alignment will result in greater flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash, as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate.  see note 10 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion. liquidity and capital resourceswe need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.  the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations.  the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and investment securities balances and credit available to the company at march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014: march 31, 2015 december 31, 2014 (in billions)cash, cash equivalents, time

funds from the line of credit during the periods presented.cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion at march 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively, or 47% and 42% of our total cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities as of such dates.  it is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 17 (income tax) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings.  if these earnings are needed for u.s. operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states, the company would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation.our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers.  see note 12 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part i, item 1 of this report for a description of these guarantees.  historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of the future.  the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see part i, item 1a - risk factors of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014; note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report; and “-business environment”.29table of
