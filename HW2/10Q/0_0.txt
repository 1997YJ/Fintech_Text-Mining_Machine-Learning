has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact product sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.first quarter fiscal 2019 highlightstotal net sales decreased 5% or $4.0 billion during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018, driven by lower iphone net sales, partially offset primarily by higher wearables, home and accessories and services net sales.

year-over-year services gross margin percentage increased during the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to a favorable mix of services with higher margins and the impact of higher services net sales on the company’s services fixed cost structure.the company anticipates total gross margin percentage during the second quarter of 2019 to be between 37.0% and 38.0%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected total gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.apple inc. | q1 2019 form 10-q | 27operating expensesoperating expenses for the three months ended december 29, 2018 and december 30, 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions): three months

other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.note 1, “summary of significant accounting policies” in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q and in the notes to consolidated financial

performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the company’s estimated ssps. revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. the company’s process for determining estimated ssps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should future facts and circumstances change, the company’s ssps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and services related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the nature of the unspecified software upgrade rights and product-related bundled services offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.apple inc. | q1 2019 form 10-q | 32impairment of marketable debt securitiesthe company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this determination, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the company’s assessment of whether an available-for-sale debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.item 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthis section and

inc. | q1 2019 form 10-q | 24business seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact product sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.first quarter fiscal 2019 highlightstotal net sales decreased 5% or $4.0 billion during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter in 2018, driven by lower iphone net sales,

on the company’s services fixed cost structure.the company anticipates total gross margin percentage during the second quarter of 2019 to be between 37.0% and 38.0%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected total gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the company’s frequent introductions and transitions of products and

be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. while the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.note 1, “summary of significant accounting policies” in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of the 2018 form 10-k, and “critical accounting policies and estimates” in part ii, item 7 of the 2018 form 10-k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. with the exception of revenue recognition and impairment of marketable debt securities, there have been no material changes to the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2018 form 10-k.revenue recognitionthe company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iphone, mac, ipad and certain other products. the first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. the second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include icloud, siri and maps. the third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. the company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“ssp”). because the company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the company’s estimated ssps. revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. the company’s process for determining estimated ssps involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should future facts and circumstances change, the company’s ssps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and services related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the nature of the unspecified software upgrade rights and product-related bundled services offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.apple inc. | q1 2019 form 10-q | 32impairment of marketable debt securitiesthe company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this determination, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the company’s assessment of whether an available-for-sale debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.
