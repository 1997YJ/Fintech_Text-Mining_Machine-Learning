environment, strategy and outlookour businesswe apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies (alliance revenues).on june 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of our animal health business, zoetis inc. (zoetis), and recognized a gain of approximately $10.4 billion, net of tax, in gain on disposal of discontinued operations––net of tax in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended september 29, 2013. the operating results of this business through june 24, 2013, the date of disposal, are reported as income from discontinued operations––net of tax in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended september 29, 2013. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisition, divestiture, licensing arrangements and equity-method investments: divestiture and see the “our business development initiatives” and “discontinued operations” sections of this md&a.we manage our commercial operations through a global commercial structure consisting of three operating segments, each of which is led by a single manager––the global innovative pharmaceutical segment (gip); the global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare segment (voc); and the global established pharmaceutical segment (gep). each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain in-process research and development (ipr&d) projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof of concept. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 13. segment, geographic and other revenue information and the “our strategy” section of this md&a below.the financial information included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the united states (u.s.) is as of and for the three and nine months ended august 24, 2014 and august 25, 2013.our 2014 performancerevenues––third quarter 2014revenues in the third quarter of 2014 were $12.4 billion, a decrease of 2% compared to the same period in 2013, which reflects an operational decrease of $270 million, or 2%. the operational decrease was primarily the result of:•losses of exclusivity and declining alliance revenues which had a negative impact of approximately $750 million and which primarily consisted of:◦the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada (approximately $425 million);◦the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-source generic competition for detrol la in the u.s., aricept in canada and viagra in most major european markets (aggregate decline of approximately $139 million);◦the ongoing termination of the spiriva collaboration in certain countries (approximately $93 million); and ◦the loss of exclusivity for certain other products (approximately $61 million),•the continued erosion of branded lipitor in the u.s. and most other developed markets due to generic competition and the operational  decline of certain products, including atorvastatin, norvasc, effexor, metaxalone,vfend, genotropin and premarin (collectively, approximately $250 million),partially offset by:•the operational growth of certain products in certain developed markets, including lyrica, nexium 24hr in the u.s. as a result of its may 2014 launch, prevnar in the u.s. and developed rest of world, eliquis, xeljanz, xalkori and inlyta, among others (collectively, approximately $486 million); and•a 9% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets, including strong operational growth from lipitor, primarily in china, and prevenar 13 (collectively, approximately $266 million).46in addition, revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $11 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.revenues––first nine months 2014revenues in the first nine months of 2014 were $36.5 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to the same period in 2013, which reflects an operational decrease of $1.1 billion, or 3%. the operational decrease was primarily the result of:•the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada (approximately $1.2 billion);•the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-source generic competition for detrol la in the u.s., viagra in most major european markets, and lyrica and aricept in canada (aggregate decline of approximately $558 million); •the continued erosion of branded lipitor in the u.s. and most other developed markets due to generic competition and the operational decline of certain products, including norvasc, metaxalone, atorvastatin, effexor,  genotropin, caduet, aromasin, dilantin, cardura and zoloft (approximately $713 million);•the ongoing termination of the spiriva collaboration in certain countries (approximately $396 million); and•the loss of exclusivity for certain other products (approximately $200 million),partially offset by:•the operational growth of certain products in certain developed markets, including lyrica, nexium 24hr in the u.s. as a result of its may 2014 launch, prevnar in the u.s. and developed rest of world, eliquis, xeljanz, celebrex, xalkori and inlyta, among others, as well as the contribution from the collaboration with mylan inc. to market generic drugs in japan (approximately $1.4 billion); and•an 8% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets (approximately $603 million).in addition, revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $405 million, or 1%, in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.income from continuing operations––third quarter 2014income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2014 was $2.7 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting, among other items, in addition to the lower revenues described above:•higher royalty-related income (up $129 million) primarily due to royalties earned on sales of enbrel in the u.s. and canada after october 31, 2013. on that date, the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired, and pfizer became entitled to royalties for a 36-month period thereafter (see also the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net);•lower restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (down $252 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives); •an estimated loss recorded in the third quarter of 2013 associated with an option to acquire the remaining interest in laboratório teuto brasileiro (teuto) of approximately $223 million and income recorded in the third quarter of 2014 of approximately $90 million, reflecting a decline in the estimated loss from the aforementioned option (see also the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net); •lower purchase accounting adjustments (down $94 million); and •a lower effective tax rate (down 2.2 percentage points to 25.4%) (see also the “provision for taxes on income” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 5. tax matters),partially offset by:•higher cost of sales (up $81 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––cost of sales” section of this md&a); •higher selling, informational and administrative expenses (up $161 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––selling, information and administrative expenses (si&a) expenses” section of this md&a);

md&a.our operating environmentindustry-specific challengesthe majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in our 2013 annual report on form 10-k, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and highly regulated. as a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. these factors include, among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, healthcare legislation, pipeline productivity and the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition among branded products.48intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rightsthe loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues.we have lost exclusivity for a number of our products in certain markets and we have lost collaboration rights with respect to a number of our alliance products in certain markets, and certain of our products and alliance products are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years.our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim for spiriva expires on a country-by-country basis between 2012 and 2016. on april 29, 2014, the 10-year alliance between boehringer ingelheim and pfizer for the promotion and marketing of spiriva in the u.s. came to an end. boehringer ingelheim now exclusively markets and supplies spiriva in the u.s. we expect to experience a graduated decline in revenues from spiriva through 2016 as agreements for other markets enter their final year and subsequently expire. see the “intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rights” section of our 2013 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our 2013 annual report on form 10-k, for information about (i) recent losses of product exclusivity impacting product revenues, (ii) recent and expected losses of collaboration rights impacting alliance revenues and (iii) losses and expected losses of product exclusivity in 2014. in addition, we expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years. for additional information, see the “patents and other intellectual property rights” section in part i, item 1, “business”, of our 2013 annual report on form 10-k.our 2014 financial guidance reflects the projected impact of the loss of exclusivity of various products and the expiration of certain alliance product contract rights discussed above. for additional information about our 2014 financial guidance, see the “our financial guidance for 2014” section of this md&a.we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights whenever we deem appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues––major biopharmaceutical products” and “revenues––selected product descriptions” sections of this md&a. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation.regulatory environment/pricing and access––u.s. healthcare legislationin march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (together, the u.s. healthcare legislation, and also known as the affordable care act or aca), was enacted in the u.s. as explained more fully in our 2013 annual report on form 10-k, this legislation has resulted in both current and longer-term impacts on us. we recorded the following amounts as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation:•$215 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $133 million in the third quarter of 2013, and $420 million in the first nine months of 2014 and $364 million in the first nine months of 2013, recorded as a reduction to revenues, related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •$268 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $78 million in the third quarter of 2013, and $292 million in the first nine months of 2014 and $209 million in the first nine months of 2013, recorded in selling, informational and administrative expenses, related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for u.s. income tax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs. the third quarter and first nine months of 2014 includes a $215 million charge to account for an additional year of the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee in accordance with final regulations issued in the third quarter of 2014 by the internal revenue service (irs). the charge in the first nine months of 2014 also reflected a favorable true-up associated with the final 2013 invoice received from the federal government, which reflected a lower share than that of the initial 2013 invoice.the final regulations did not change the payment schedule for the branded prescription drug fee; accordingly there is no cash flow impact from the $215 million charge.49regulatory environment/pricing and access––u.s. government and other payer group pressures•sustainable growth rate replacement—the medicare physician payment formula known as the sustainable growth rate (sgr) is routinely overridden by congressional action because it would lead to dramatic decreases in physician payment. on april 1, 2014, the president of the u.s. signed into law another extension that will maintain physician payment through march 2015. prior to expiration of the extension, it is likely that congress will consider legislation to permanently repeal the sgr and replace it with a new payment model. the congressional budget office has estimated that the cost to the federal government of repealing and replacing the sgr would be approximately $130 billion over 10 years. the source of those funds could include additional taxes on and/or rebate requirements applicable to the pharmaceutical industry, including pfizer. •federal debt ceiling—after the u.s. federal debt ceiling was reached on may 19, 2013 and measures taken by the u.s. treasury department to enable the u.s. federal government to continue meeting its financial obligations were nearly exhausted, congress enacted legislation on october 16, 2013 that suspended the debt ceiling through february 7, 2014 and preserved the ability of the u.s. treasury department to use “extraordinary measures” to avoid a default on u.s. federal government debt for a short period of time thereafter. in february 2014, congress enacted legislation that further suspends the debt ceiling until march 15, 2015, effectively ensuring the u.s. federal government’s ability to satisfy its financial obligations until that date, including under medicare, medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that have a direct impact on our results of operations. we believe it is unlikely that the debt ceiling will not be further suspended, given historical recent precedent. it is unclear how the government would prioritize its financial obligations in the case of a funding shortfall, and we cannot dismiss the potential for delayed or reduced payments to providers, including medicare part d plans, that could impact their ability to pay for prescription medicines.as the healthcare spending growth rate in the u.s. continues to outpace inflation, cost-reduction and access pressures are increasing in intensity. containing entitlement spending, including medicare and medicaid, is a major focus of deficit-reduction efforts. the aca, which expanded the role of the u.s. government as a healthcare payer, is accelerating changes in the u.s. healthcare marketplace, and the potential for additional pricing and access pressures continues to be significant. many of these developments may impact drug utilization, in particular branded drug utilization. some employers, seeking to avoid the tax on high-cost health insurance in the aca to be imposed in 2018, are already scaling back healthcare benefits. some health plans and pharmacy benefit managers are seeking greater pricing predictability from pharmaceutical manufacturers in contractual negotiations. other health plans and pharmacy benefit managers are increasing their focus on spending on specialty medicines by implementing co-insurance in place of a flat co-payment. because co-insurance passes on a percentage of a drug’s cost to the patient, this shift has the potential to significantly increase patient out-of-pocket costs.overall, there is increasing pressure on u.s. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions. these new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. at the same time, these models can also expand utilization by encouraging physicians to screen, diagnose and focus on outcomes. in response to the evolving u.s. and global healthcare spending landscape, we are continuing to work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major u.s. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products. further, we are seeking to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs. the global economic environmentin addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, and as explained more fully in our 2013 annual report on form 10-k, we, like other businesses, continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment, which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the u.s., europe and japan, and in a number of emerging markets. •we believe that patients, who are experiencing increases in co-pays and restrictions on access to medicines as payers seek to control costs, sometimes switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. we continue to experience pricing pressure in various markets around the world, including in the u.s. with highly competitive insurance markets, in developed european markets, japan and in a number of emerging markets, with government-mandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products and government-imposed access restrictions in certain countries. furthermore, some government agencies and third-party payers use health technology assessments in ways that, at times, lead to restricted access to and lower prices for new medicines.50•we continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. for further information about our accounts receivable, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.•significant portions of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen, australian dollar, the u.k. pound, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. conversely, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including venezuela, can impact our results and financial guidance. for further information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a. despite the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial condition, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2013 annual report on form 10-k.our strategywe believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. we continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. we continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to patients and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. we remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company's purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that significantly improve their lives. by doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders. commercial operationsat the beginning of our fiscal year 2014, we began managing our commercial operations through a new global commercial structure consisting of three operating segments, each of which is led by a single manager––the global innovative pharmaceutical segment (gip); the global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare segment (voc); and the global established pharmaceutical segment (gep). a significant change effected by our new structure is the full integration of emerging markets into each business. emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our new structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets.some additional information about each product grouping follows:•global innovative pharmaceutical segment––gip comprises medicines within several therapeutic areas that are generally expected to have market exclusivity beyond 2015. these therapeutic areas include immunology and inflammation, cardiovascular/metabolic, neuroscience and pain, rare diseases and women's/men's health. 51•global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare segment––voc focuses on the development and commercialization of vaccines and products for oncology and consumer healthcare. each of the three businesses that comprise this segment operates with distinct specialization in terms of the science, talent and market approach necessary to deliver value to consumers and patients. •global established pharmaceutical segment––gep includes the brands that have lost market exclusivity and, generally, the mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 in most major markets and, to a much smaller extent, generic pharmaceuticals. additionally, gep includes our sterile injectable products and biosimilar development portfolio.we expect that the gip and voc biopharmaceutical portfolios of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line products will be sustained by ongoing internal investments and targeted business development designed to maximize the value of our in-line products and ensure a robust pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need. the assets managed by these groups are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers. in addition, voc includes our global consumer healthcare business, which manufactures and markets several well-known, over-the-counter (otc) products. gep is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. gep leverages our biologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. gep may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its commercial strategies.for additional information about our operating structure, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 13a. segment, geographic and other revenue information: segment information.for additional information about the 2014 performance of each of our operating segments, see the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a.research operationswe continue to transform our global r&d organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules––immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. another area of focus is biosimilars. while a significant portion of r&d is done internally, we continue to seek to expand our pipeline by entering into agreements with other companies to develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. collaboration, alliance and license agreements and acquisitions allow us to capitalize on these compounds to expand our pipeline of potential future products. in addition, collaborations and alliances allow us to share risk and to access external scientific and technological expertise.for additional information about r&d by operating segment, see the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a. for additional information about our pending new drug applications and supplemental filings, see the “analysis of the condensed

that we believe have the potential to advance our pipeline and maximize the value of our in-line products, see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.business developmentwe continue to build on our broad portfolio of businesses and to expand our r&d pipeline through various business development transactions. for additional information about recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe have the potential to advance our pipeline, enhance our product portfolio and maximize the value of our in-line products, see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.intellectual property rightswe continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure 52appropriate patient access. in addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches designed to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity. for additional information about our current efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation.capital allocation and expense managementwe seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and robust liquidity so that we continue to have the financial resources necessary to take advantage of prudent commercial, research and business development opportunities and to directly enhance shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. for additional information about our financial condition, liquidity, capital resources, share purchases and dividends, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.we remain focused on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the company. for additional information about our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, see the “costs and expenses––restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a.our business development initiativeswe are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. we are especially interested in opportunities in our high-priority therapeutic areas––immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases––and in emerging markets and established products. another area of focus is biosimilars. we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities for our businesses.the more significant recent transactions and events are described below. •innopharma, inc. (innopharma)––on september 24, 2014, we completed our acquisition of innopharma, a privately-held pharmaceutical development company, for an upfront cash payment of $225 million and contingent milestone payments of up to $135 million. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2a. acquisition, divestiture, licensing arrangements and equity-method investments: acquisition.•marketed vaccines business of baxter international inc. (baxter)––on july 30, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines for $635 million. as part of the transaction, we will also acquire a portion of baxter’s facility in orth, austria, where these vaccines are manufactured. baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines consists of neisvac-c and fsme-immun/ticovac. neisvac-c is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group c meningococcal meningitis and fsme-immun/ticovac is a vaccine that helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions as well as regulatory approvals in several markets, including some countries in the european union (eu), and is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. we do not expect this transaction to have an impact on our 2014 financial guidance.•cellectis sa (cellectis)––on june 18, 2014, we entered into a global strategic arrangement with cellectis to develop chimeric antigen receptor t-cell (car-t) immunotherapies in the field of oncology directed at select cellular surface antigen targets. in august 2014, we made an upfront payment of $80 million to cellectis, and we will also fund research and development costs associated with the 15 pfizer-selected targets and the four cellectis-selected targets within the arrangement. cellectis is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per product that resulted from pfizer-selected targets. cellectis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of any products that are commercialized by pfizer. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2c. acquisition, divestiture, licensing arrangements and equity-method investments: licensing arrangements.•viiv healthcare limited (viiv)––on january 21, 2014, the european commission approved tivicay (dolutegravir), a product for the treatment of hiv-1 infection, developed by viiv, an equity method investee. this approval, in accordance with the agreement between glaxosmithkline plc and pfizer, triggered a reduction in our equity interest in viiv from 12.6% to 11.7% and an increase in glaxosmithkline plc’s equity interest in viiv from 77.4% to 78.3%, effective april 1, 2014. as a result, in the first nine months of 2014, we recognized a loss of approximately $30 million in other (income)/deductions––net. we continue to account for our investment in viiv under the equity method due to the significant influence that we 53continue to have through our board representation and minority veto rights. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2d. acquisition, divestiture, licensing arrangements and equity-method investments: equity-method investments.•zoetis––on june 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of zoetis. the full disposition was completed through a series of steps, including, in the first quarter of 2013, the formation of zoetis and an initial public offering (ipo) of an approximate 19.8% interest in zoetis and, in the second quarter of 2013, an exchange offer for the remaining 80.2% interest. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisition, divestiture, licensing arrangements and equity-method investments: divestiture.•hisun pfizer pharmaceuticals company limited (hisun pfizer)––in connection with the september 6, 2012 formation of hisun pfizer in conjunction with zhejiang hisun pharmaceuticals co., ltd. (hisun), a leading pharmaceutical company in china, in the first quarter of 2013, we and hisun contributed certain assets to hisun pfizer. hisun pfizer is 49% owned by pfizer and 51% owned by hisun. our contributions constituted a business, as defined by u.s. gaap, and in the first nine months of 2013, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $459 million in other (income)/deductions––net. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2d. acquisition, divestiture, licensing arrangements and equity-method investments: equity-method investments.•nexium over-the-counter rights––in connection with our august 2012 agreement with astrazeneca plc (astrazeneca) for the exclusive, global, over-the-counter rights for nexium, a leading prescription drug currently approved to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, (i) on may 27, 2014, we launched nexium 24hr in the u.s. and on july 11, 2014, we paid astrazeneca a related $200 million product launch milestone payment and (ii) on august 1, 2014, we launched nexium control in europe, and on september 15, 2014, we paid astrazeneca a related $50 million product launch milestone payment. the milestone payments for this consumer healthcare asset acquisition have been recorded in identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. astrazeneca is eligible to receive future milestone payments of up to $300 million, based on product launches outside the u.s. and level of worldwide sales and is eligible to receive royalty payments, based on worldwide sales. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2c. acquisition, divestiture, licensing arrangements and equity-method investments: licensing arrangements.for a description of the more significant recent transactions through

a decrease of $323 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. in addition to the operational factors noted in the “our 2014 performance” section of this md&a, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by $428 million, or 1%, in the first nine months of 2014. foreign exchange did not have a significant impact on biopharmaceutical revenues in the third quarter of 2014.geographically, •in the u.s., biopharmaceutical revenues decreased $364 million, or 8%, in the third quarter of 2014 and decreased $1.3 billion, or 9%, in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, reflecting, among other things:◦lower alliance revenues, primarily due to enbrel, reflecting the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement in october 2013 (approximately $400 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2014), and spiriva, reflecting the final-year terms, and termination on april 29, 2014, of the co-promotion collaboration, which, per the terms of the collaboration agreement, resulted in a decline of our share of spiriva revenue (approximately $72 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $322 million in the first nine months of 2014); and◦lower revenues from detrol la due to loss of exclusivity (approximately $68 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $259 million in the first nine months of 2014), and lower revenues from lipitor (approximately $40 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $152 million in the first nine months of 2014),57partially offset by:◦the strong performance of lyrica (approximately $77 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $263 million in the first nine months of 2014) as well as the growth of prevnar, xeljanz, eliquis, xalkori, celebrex and inlyta (collectively, approximately $230 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $505 million in the first nine months of 2014).•in our international markets, biopharmaceutical revenues increased $41 million, or 1%, in the third quarter of 2014 and decreased $447 million, or 2%, in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. operationally, revenues increased $49 million, or 1%, in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 and decreased $20 million, or relatively flat, in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 reflecting, among other things:◦lower revenues as a result of the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-source generic competition for viagra in most major european markets and lyrica in canada (collectively, approximately $35 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $232 million in the first nine months of 2014);◦the operational decline of certain products, including norvasc, xalabrands, zithromax, effexor and chantix/champix, in developed international markets, and for the first nine months of 2014, sutent in china (collectively, approximately $62 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $219 million for the first nine months of 2014);◦the continued erosion of branded lipitor in most international developed markets (approximately $51 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $126 million for the first nine months of 2014); and◦lower alliance revenues (approximately $47 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $187 million in the first nine months of 2014, excluding eliquis), primarily due to the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in canada, the ongoing termination of the spiriva collaboration agreement in certain countries, the loss of exclusivity for aricept in canada and the termination of the co-promotion agreement for aricept in japan in december 2012 (primarily impacting the first nine months of 2014),more than offset by in the third quarter of 2014 and, in the first nine months of 2014, partially offset by:◦the operational growth of xeljanz, prevnar and celebrex as well as the contribution from the collaboration with mylan inc. to market generic drugs in japan (approximately $65 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $210 million in the first nine months of 2014); and◦higher revenues for enbrel outside canada, lyrica in developed markets, and the performance of recently launched products xalkori, eliquis and inlyta (collectively, up approximately $181 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $563 million in the first nine months of 2014).the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on international biopharmaceutical revenues of approximately $8 million in the third quarter of 2014 and 2%, or approximately $428 million, in the first nine months of 2014 also contributed to a decrease in biopharmaceutical revenues from our international markets.during the third quarter of 2014, international biopharmaceutical revenues represented 61.6% of total biopharmaceutical revenues, compared to 59.6% in the third quarter of 2013. during the first nine months of 2014, international biopharmaceutical revenues represented 62.3% of total biopharmaceutical revenues, compared with 60.4% in the first nine months of 2013.for additional information about operating segment revenues, see the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a.revenue deductionsour gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, that are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized, and primarily represent rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers/distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions.historically, our adjustments of estimates to actual results have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results generally have been less than 1% of biopharmaceutical revenues, and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues. product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.58the following table provides information about deductions from revenues:  three months ended nine months ended(millions of dollars) september 28, 2014 september 29,

primarily represent reimbursements to u.s. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d) sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the u.s., discounts and distribution fees.(e) for the three months ended september 28, 2014, associated with the following segments: gip ($0.9 billion); voc ($0.3 billion); and gep

september 28, 2014, associated with the following segments: gip ($2.4 billion); voc ($0.8 billion); and gep ($6.4 billion). for the nine months ended september 29, 2013, associated with the following segments: gip ($2.0 billion); voc ($0.7 billion); and gep ($6.4 billion).the total rebates and chargebacks for the third quarter of 2014 increased compared to the same period in 2013, primarily as a result of:•an increase in sales allowances primarily as a result of an increase in the distribution fees in the u.s. as the third quarter of 2013 included a contractual credit. in 2014, a similar contractual credit was recorded in the second quarter of 2014. the increase in sales allowances was also due to increases in sales allowances in certain europe and asia markets;•an increase in medicaid and related state program rebates, primarily as a result of updated channel sales estimates; and•an increase in medicare rebates due to a higher volume of sales in the medicare patient population.the total rebates and chargebacks for the first nine months of 2014 increased compared to the same period in 2013, primarily as a result of:•an increase in medicare rebates due to a higher volume of sales in the medicare patient population; and•an increase in performance-based contract rebates as a result of contract arrangements and incentives, primarily in europe and china. our accruals for medicaid and related state program rebates, medicare rebates, performance-based contract rebates, sales allowances, chargebacks and sales returns and cash discounts totaled $3.2 billion

meaningful.61revenues––selected product descriptions•lyrica (gip/gep) is indicated in the u.s. for three neuropathic pain conditions, fibromyalgia and adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures. in certain countries outside the u.s., indications include neuropathic pain (peripheral and central), fibromyalgia, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder. worldwide revenues for lyrica increased 16% in the third quarter of 2014, and 13% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. in the u.s., revenues increased 15% in the third quarter of 2014, and 18% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, driven by increased investment in effective direct-to-consumer advertising combined with strong field force performance and the recent promotional launch of new data demonstrating efficacy in treating fibromyalgia patients receiving antidepressants for their co-morbid depression, despite continued competition from generic versions of competitive medicines. internationally, lyrica revenues increased 17% in the third quarter of 2014, and 10% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, with the growth due to a focus on enhancing diagnosis and treatment rates of neuropathic back pain, and expediting the identification and appropriate treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in the eu, physician education regarding neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in japan and an effective direct-to-consumer campaign to increase awareness in japan. in addition, growth was driven by gaining reimbursement in australia and an effective multi-channel direct-to-consumer campaign driving an increase in visits to physicians. foreign exchange had a favorable impact on international revenues of 1% in the third quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013 and had no impact for the first nine months of 2014. worldwide revenues from lyrica in our gip segment increased 18% operationally in the third quarter of 2014 and 15% in the first nine months of 2014, and in our gep segment, revenues from lyrica increased 12% operationally in the third quarter of 2014 and 11% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013.•prevnar family of products (v) consists of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 and prevnar/prevenar (7-valent), our pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for the prevention of various syndromes of pneumococcal disease. overall, worldwide revenues for the prevnar family of products increased 19% in the third quarter of 2014, and 11% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. in the u.s., revenues for prevnar 13 increased 26% in the third quarter of 2014, and 15% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, mainly due to government purchasing patterns and price increases, and increased demand, primarily driven by additional market penetration for prevnar 13 in adults. internationally, revenues for the prevenar family of products increased 12% in the third quarter of 2014, and 7% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily reflecting increased shipments associated with the global alliance for vaccines and immunization as well as the timing of government purchases in various emerging markets. foreign exchange had a favorable impact on international revenues of 1% in the third quarter 2014, and an unfavorable impact of 2% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. on february 24, 2014, we announced the top-line results of the community-acquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults (capita), which was conducted in order to fulfill requirements in connection with the fda’s approval of the prevnar 13 adult indication under its accelerated approval program. this study of approximately 85,000 subjects evaluated the efficacy of prevnar 13 in adults age 65 and older. capita met its primary clinical objective, which was efficacy against a first episode of vaccine-type, community-acquired pneumonia (cap). it also met both of its secondary clinical objectives, which were efficacy against (i) a first episode of non-bacteremic/non-invasive, vaccine-type cap and (ii) a first episode of vaccine-type, invasive pneumococcal disease. we are in the process of sharing the capita data with u.s. and worldwide regulatory authorities and vaccine technical committees to help inform any decisions regarding potential prevnar 13 label and recommendation updates. we made submissions of this data to the fda and eu regulatory authorities in july 2014 and these filings were accepted and validated, respectively, and are currently under review. we expect that the capita data will be an important component in any consideration of potential updated or new recommendations for adults and that other key factors, such as the current burden of pneumococcal disease in adults, also will be taken into consideration. we discussed with the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention’s (cdc) advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) at their scheduled june 2014 meeting the results of the capita data as well as other considerations regarding a potential expanded recommendation for prevnar 13 use among adults. 62in august 2014, the acip held an ad-hoc meeting to vote on the expanded use of prevnar 13 in older adults. the acip voted to recommend prevnar 13 for routine use to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which includes pneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. these acip recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the cdc and u.s. department of health and human services, and were published in the morbidity and mortality weekly report (mmwr) in september 2014 by the cdc. as with other vaccines, the cdc regularly monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations; in this case, however, the cdc announced formally that it will conduct this review in 2018. currently, we are working with a number of u.s. investigators to monitor the proportion of cap caused by the serotypes included in prevenar 13 and continue to observe trends.on june 20, 2014, prevenar 13 was approved in japan for adults 65 years of age and older for the prevention of pneumococcal disease caused by 13 s. pneumoniae serotypes covered by the vaccine.•enbrel (gip, outside of the u.s. and canada), for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis affecting the spine, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues, excluding the u.s. and canada, of 3% in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. results were favorably impacted by continued market leadership in rheumatoid arthritis. foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 1% in the third quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013 and had no impact for the first nine months of 2014.the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement with amgen inc. (amgen), under which we co-promoted enbrel in the u.s. and canada and shared in the profits from enbrel sales in those countries, and which we included in alliance revenues through october 31, 2013, expired on that date and, subject to the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to a royalty stream for 36 months thereafter, which has been and is expected to continue to be significantly less than our share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canadian sales prior to the expiration. the royalties paid to us during the 36-month period are and will be included in other (income)/deductions––net rather than in revenues in our consolidated statements of income from november 1, 2013. following the end of the royalty period, we are not entitled to any further revenues from enbrel sales in the u.s. and canada. our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the u.s. and canada will not be affected by the expiration of the co-promotion agreement with amgen. •celebrex (gep), indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis worldwide and for the management of acute pain in adults in the u.s., japan and certain other markets, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 2% in the third quarter of 2014, and 1% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to favorable pricing in the u.s. and strong demand from the lower back pain indication in japan, partially offset by share erosion in the u.s. and the developed markets in europe.in the u.s., revenues increased 2% in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to price increases and overall market growth, partially offset by continued share erosion, retailer inventory reductions, and higher rebates than those a year ago. internationally, celebrex revenues increased 1% in the third quarter of 2014, and were relatively flat in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. strong operational performance in international markets in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, was driven by growth in japan (strong performance in the low back pain and osteoarthritis indications), south korea (maintaining share despite competition), and in emerging markets, partially offset by lower revenues in the developed markets in europe due to price reductions as governments continue to address their budget deficits. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 1% in the third quarter of 2014, and 4% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. •lipitor (gep) is for the treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood. lipitor has lost exclusivity and faces generic competition in all major markets. branded lipitor recorded worldwide revenues of $490 million, or a decrease of 8% in the third quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to continued brand erosion in the u.s. and developed markets due to generic competition, partially offset by operational increases in emerging markets, primarily in china. revenues were $1.5 billion, or a decrease of 13%, in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, due to:◦the impact of loss of exclusivity and brand erosion due to generic competition; ◦the continuing impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition from generics and branded products worldwide; and ◦the increased payer pressure worldwide, including the need for flexible rebate policies,63partially offset by:◦lower rebates in the u.s. geographically,◦in the u.s., revenues decreased 51% in the third quarter of 2014, and decreased 45% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013; and ◦in our international markets, revenues decreased 1% in the third quarter of 2014, and 5% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 1% in the third quarter of 2014, and 2% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013.•viagra (gep/gip) is indicated for the treatment for erectile dysfunction. viagra worldwide revenues decreased 7% in the third quarter of 2014, and 13% in the first nine months, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in international revenues. international (gep) revenues decreased 17% in the third quarter, and 30% in the first nine months, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to the entry of generics in developed europe. loss of exclusivity for viagra in major european markets occurred in late-june 2013. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 1% in the third quarter of 2014, and 3% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. revenues in the u.s.

those used to treat serious gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus-aureus. zyvox worldwide revenues increased 6% in the third quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013 due to solid growth in latin america and africa middle east. revenues in the first nine months of 2014 were essentially flat compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to a prolonged supply interruption of zyvox iv in china that is expected to continue through 2014. foreign exchange had a 1% favorable impact on international revenues in the third quarter of 2014 and an unfavorable impact of 1% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013.•sutent (o) is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc); gastrointestinal stromal tumors after disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate; and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. sutent worldwide revenues

(while enbrel alliance revenues declined $425 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2014, we received royalty income from enbrel in the u.s. and canada of $136 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $397 million in the first nine months of 2014, which is recorded in other (income)/deductions—net in the condensed consolidated statements on income. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 4. other (income)/deductions—net.);◦the expiration or near-term expiration of the co-promotion collaboration for spiriva (gep) in japan, the u.s. (where the collaboration expired in april 2014), and certain european countries combined with the expiration of the collaboration in australia, canada and south korea, which resulted in an operational decrease in pfizer's share of spiriva revenues of $93 million in the third quarter of 2014, and $396 million in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013; and◦the loss of exclusivity for aricept in canada in december 2013, which resulted in a decrease in operational revenues of approximately $36 million in the third quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, and combined with the termination of the co-promotion agreement for aricept (gep) in japan in december 2012, resulted in an operational decrease in pfizer's share of aricept revenues of approximately $94 million in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013.see the “our operating environment—intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rights” section of our 2013 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our 2013 annual report on form 10-k and this quarterly report on form 10-q, for information regarding the expiration of various contract rights relating to aricept, spiriva, enbrel and rebif.on april 29, 2014, the 10-year alliance between boehringer ingelheim and pfizer for the promotion and marketing of spiriva in the u.s. came to an end. boehringer ingelheim now exclusively markets and supplies spiriva in the u.s.eliquis (apixaban) (gip) is being jointly developed and commercialized by pfizer and bristol-myers squibb (bms). in 2012, eliquis (apixaban) was approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the 27 countries of the eu, plus iceland and norway, canada, japan and the u.s. to date, we have launched that indication for eliquis in the u.s., 23 eu markets, canada and australia. in addition, eliquis is approved in the u.s. and europe for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and pulmonary embolism (pe). the two companies share commercialization expenses and profit/losses equally on a global basis. while we are the third entrant in this market, we believe we have a differentiated product profile and continue to invest in medical education, peer-to-peer programs to assist physicians in understanding the data, and direct-to-consumer advertising in the u.s. we have seen increased prescribing by cardiologists and primary care providers compared to prior periods.•embeda (gip)—in november 2013, we announced that the fda had approved a prior approval supplement for an update to the embeda manufacturing process. this update addressed the pre-specified stability requirement that led to the voluntary recall of embeda from the market in march 2011. in october 2014, the fda approved an updated label for embeda extended release capsules, for oral use, to include abuse-deterrence study data. embeda is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. we expect embeda will be available in the u.s. in early 2015.see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies for a discussion of recent developments concerning patent and product litigation relating to certain of the products discussed above.product developmentswe continue to invest in r&d to provide potential future sources of revenues through the development of new products, as well as through additional uses for in-line and alliance products. notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for existing products or any of our other products in development.we continue to transform our global r&d organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will 66expedite the pace of innovation and productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules—immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. another area of focus is biosimilars. our development pipeline, which is updated quarterly, can be found at www.pfizer.com/pipeline. it includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication, phase of development and, for late-stage programs, mechanism of action. the information currently in our development pipeline is as of november 6, 2014.the following series of tables provides information about significant regulatory actions by, and filings pending with, the fda and regulatory authorities in the eu and japan, as well as additional indications and new drug candidates in late-stage development.recent fda approvalsproductindicationdate approvedtrumenba (mnb rlp2086)(pf-05212366)a prophylactic vaccine for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by neisseria meningitidis serogroup b in individuals 10 through 25 years of ageoctober 2014eliquis (apixaban)(a)treatment of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and pulmonary embolism (pe), and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent dvt and peaugust 2014eliquis (apixaban)(a)prevention of dvt, which may lead to pe, in adult patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgerymarch 2014duavee (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene)(b)treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women with a uterusoctober 2013(a) this indication for eliquis (apixaban) was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with bristol-myers squibb (bms).(b) the fda approved the 0.45 mg/20 mg dose of duavee for these indications. we received a “complete response” letter from the fda with regard to the 0.625 mg/20 mg dose for these indications, and for an indication for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.pending u.s. new drug applications (nda) and supplemental filingsproductindicationdate filed*palbociclib(a)first-line treatment of patients with estrogen receptor-positive (er+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (her2-) advanced breast canceroctober 2014tafamidis meglumine(b)treatment of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (ttr-fap)february 2012celebrex (celecoxib)(c)chronic painoctober 2009remoxy (oxycodone hydrochloride)(d)management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequateaugust 2008viviant (bazedoxifene)(e)osteoporosis treatment and preventionaugust 2006*the dates set forth in this column are the dates on which the fda accepted our submissions.(a) first-line treatment of patients with er+ and her2- advanced breast cancer has a pending u.s. nda, and has been granted priority review designation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda).(b) in may 2012, the fda's peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. in june 2012, the fda issued a “complete response” letter with respect to the tafamidis nda. the fda has requested the completion of a second efficacy study, and also has asked for additional information on the data within the current tafamidis nda. we continue to work with the fda to define a path forward.(c) in june 2010, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the celebrex chronic pain supplemental nda. the supplemental nda remains pending while we await the completion of the precision trial, anticipated in 2015, which will inform our next steps. the precision trial is designed to assess the relative long-term cardiovascular safety of celebrex compared to prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen in the treatment of arthritis pain.(d) in 2005, king pharmaceuticals, inc. (king) entered into an agreement with pain therapeutics, inc. (pt) to develop and commercialize remoxy. in august 2008, the fda accepted the nda for remoxy that had been submitted by king and pt. in december 2008, the fda issued a “complete response” letter. in march 2009, king exercised its right under the agreement with pt to assume sole control and responsibility for the development of remoxy. in december 2010, king resubmitted the nda for remoxy with the fda. in june 2011, we and pt announced that a “complete response” letter had been received from the fda with regard to the resubmission of the nda. having achieved technical milestones related to manufacturing and following guidance received from the fda earlier in 2013, we announced in october 2013 that we will proceed with the additional clinical studies and other actions required to address the “complete response” letter 67received in june 2011. in october 2014, we concluded an internal review of the top-line results of five recently completed clinical studies required to address the “complete response” letter received in june 2011 from the fda, and we notified pt that we have decided to discontinue our agreement to develop and commercialize remoxy. we will work together for an orderly transition of remoxy to pt until the scheduled termination date in april 2015.(e) two “approvable” letters were received by wyeth in april and december 2007 from the fda for viviant (bazedoxifene), for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, that set forth the additional requirements for approval. in may 2008, wyeth received an “approvable” letter from the fda for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. the fda is seeking additional data, and we have been systematically working through these requirements and seeking to address the fda's concerns. in february 2008, the fda advised wyeth that it expects to convene an advisory committee to review the pending ndas for both the treatment and prevention indications after we submit our response to the “approvable” letters. in view of the recent approval of duavee by the fda, we are reassessing the next steps regarding our ndas for viviant. in april 2009, wyeth received approval in the eu for conbriza (the eu trade name for viviant) for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture.in august 2014, we withdrew the supplemental new drug application that had been filed previously with the fda, which had sought approval for the genotropin mark vii multidose disposable pre-filled pen. we continue to market genotropin and the current suite of devices

the same periods in 2013. these increases are primarily due to unfavorable changes in product mix, resulting from, among other things, the loss of enbrel alliance revenue after october 31, 2013, when the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired, and the loss of spiriva alliance revenue in the u.s. as of april 29, 2014. cost of sales in the first nine months of 2014 were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2013 as the unfavorable impact due to the changes in product mix discussed above was largely offset by favorable foreign exchange.69selling, informational and administrative (si&a) expenses  three months ended nine months ended(millions of dollars) september 28, 2014 september 29, 2013 % change september 28,

in the third quarter of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to:•increased investments in recently launched brands as well as pre-launch marketing expenses for palbociclib and trumenba; and•a $215 million charge to account for an additional year of the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee in accordance with final regulations issued in the third quarter of 2014 by the internal revenue service (irs),partially offset by:•lower expenses for field force and marketing and administrative expenses, reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, partly in response to product losses of exclusivity.foreign exchange did not have an impact on si&a expenses in the third quarter of 2014.si&a expenses decreased 1% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013. in addition to the factors listed above for the third quarter of 2014, si&a expenses for the first nine months of 2014 were favorably impacted by a reduction related to a true-up of the 2013 fee payable to the federal government under the u.s. healthcare legislation based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 1%, which more than offset the aforementioned operational factors.research and development

compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to:•upfront payments to cellectis sa and medgenesis therapeutix inc. associated with recently announced agreements; and•costs associated with ongoing phase 3 programs for certain new drug candidates and investment in the palbociclib and trumenba development programs.see also the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a.our r&d spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations––research units, within our worldwide research and development organization, are generally responsible for research assets (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept); business units are generally responsible for development assets (assets that have achieved proof-of-concept); and science-based and other platform-services organizations.we take a holistic approach to our r&d operations and manage the operations on a total-company basis through our matrix organizations described above. specifically, a single committee, co-chaired by members of our r&d and commercial organizations, is accountable for aligning resources among all of our r&d projects and for seeking to ensure that our company is focusing its r&d resources in the areas where we believe that we can be most successful and maximize our return on investment. we believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.70our research units are organized in a variety of ways (by therapeutic area or combinations of therapeutic areas, by discipline, by location, etc.) to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. because of our structure, we can rapidly redeploy resources, within a research unit, between various projects as necessary because the workforce shares similar skills, expertise and/or focus.our platform-services organizations, where a significant portion of our r&d spending occurs, provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects, and are organized into science-based functions such as pharmaceutical sciences, chemistry, drug safety, and development operations, and non-science-based functions, such as facilities, business technology and finance. as a result, within each of these functions, we are able to migrate resources among projects, candidates and/or targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases of development, allowing us to react quickly in response to evolving needs.generally, we do not disaggregate total r&d expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage a significant portion of our r&d operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, as conditions change, we believe that any prior-period information about r&d expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.restructuring charges and other costs associated with

the same periods in 2013, due to lower costs incurred in most categories, primarily reflecting the fact that we had substantially completed many of the initiatives launched in prior periods.in early 2014, we announced that we would be incurring costs in 2014-2016 related to new programs: our new global commercial structure reorganization and additional cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. for information about our current programs and expected total costs, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.the expected ongoing annual cost savings associated with our current programs, in the aggregate, are estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion by the end of 2016. the expected costs and costs savings in 2014 associated with these activities are reflected in our financial guidance for 2014. see also the “our financial guidance for 2014” section of this

income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines, consumer healthcare (otc) products, and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income. the adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted income measure is utilized:•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income basis;•our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis; and•senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted income measure. adjusted income is the performance metric utilized in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are funded from a pool based on the performance measured by three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from adjusted income. this metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool. the pool applies to the bonus plans for virtually all bonus-eligible, non-sales-force employees worldwide, including the elt members and other members of senior management.despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not 72be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a group of pharmaceutical industry peers, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans. adjusted income components“adjusted income” components are defined as the corresponding reported u.s. gaap components, excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. adjusted revenues, adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses, adjusted research and development expenses, adjusted amortization of intangible assets and adjusted other (income)/deductions––net are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall adjusted income measure. as described above, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. see the accompanying reconciliations of certain gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted information for the third quarter and first nine months of 2014 and 2013 below. the adjusted income component measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for the u.s. gaap component measures.purchase accounting adjustmentsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with pharmacia corporation (acquired in 2003), wyeth (acquired in 2009) and king pharmaceuticals, inc. (acquired in 2011), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research and development costs previously have been expensed.however, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.acquisition-related costsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.73we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory authorities.discontinued operationsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations such as the gains on the full disposition of our former animal health business (zoetis) in june 2013, the sale of our former nutrition business in november 2012 and the sale of our former capsugel business in august 2011. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.certain significant itemsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our new global commercial structure reorganization and our other non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transitional service, manufacturing and supply agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12a. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings, included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.74reconciliation of gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted

rate on non-gaap adjusted income was 26.8% in the third quarter of 2014, a decline of 0.8 percentage points from 27.6% in the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business. the effective tax rate on non-gaap adjusted income was 26.6% in the first nine months of 2014, compared with 27.4% in the first nine months of 2013. the tax rate in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 was favorably impacted by the resolution in the first and second quarters of 2014 of certain tax positions, pertaining to prior years, primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, partially offset by

research and development expenses managed by our worldwide research and development organization (wrd), which is generally responsible for research projects until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the appropriate operating segment for possible clinical and commercial development. this organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects. wrd is also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities.(iii) medical—the costs associated with our pfizer medical organization (medical), which is responsible for the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, transparency and disclosure activities, clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, partnerships with global public health and medical associations, regulatory inspection readiness reviews, internal audits of pfizer-sponsored clinical trials and internal regulatory compliance processes.(iv) corporate—the costs associated with corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance, and worldwide procurement) and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments.(v) other unallocated—other unallocated costs, representing overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing and commercial operations not directly attributable to an operating segment.81for information

the table above do not purport to reflect the additional amounts that each of our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the period presented. •wrd/medical––the information provided in the table above for wrd and medical was substantially all derived from our estimates of the costs incurred in connection with the research and development projects associated with each operating segment. •corporate/other unallocated––the information provided in the table above for corporate and other unallocated was virtually all derived using proportional allocation methods based on global, regional or country revenues or global, regional or country headcount, as well as certain cost metrics, as appropriate, such as those derived from research and development and manufacturing costs. management believes that the allocations of corporate and other unallocated costs are reasonable.(c) see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a for a definition of these “adjusted income” components.(d) includes costs associated with (i) purchase accounting adjustments; (ii) acquisition-related costs; and (iii) certain significant items, which are substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management. for additional information about these reconciling items and/or our non-gaap adjusted measure of performance, see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.(e) as our operations were not managed under the new structure until the beginning of the first quarter of 2014, certain costs and expenses could not be directly attributed to one of the new operating segments. as a result, our operating segment results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 include allocations. the amounts subject to allocation methods in the third quarter of 2013 were approximately $520 million of selling, informational and administrative expenses and approximately $230 million of research and development expenses, and the amounts subject to allocation methods in the first nine months of 2013 were approximately $1.5 billion of selling, informational and administrative expenses and approximately $650 million of research and development expenses.•the selling, informational and administrative expenses were allocated using proportional allocation methods based on associated selling costs, revenues or product-specific costs, as applicable.•the research and development expenses were allocated based on product-specific r&d costs or revenue metrics, as applicable.management believes that the allocations are reasonable.global innovative pharmaceutical operating segment•revenues decreased 4% to $3,490 million in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $3,640 in the same period in 2013 and decreased 5% to $10,114 million in the first nine months of 2014, compared to $10,672 in the same period in 2013, which includes a decrease in operational revenues of 4% in both the third quarter of 2014 and in the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to:◦the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada on october 31, 2013 (approximately $425 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion for the first nine months of 2014); for a 36-month period thereafter, we are entitled to royalty payments that have been and are expected to continue to be significantly less than 82the share of enbrel profits prior to the expiration of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement, and those royalty payments are and will be included in other (income)/deductions––net rather than in revenues; and◦loss of exclusivity for lyrica in canada in february 2013 (a decline of approximately $68 million for the first nine months of 2014), partially offset by:◦strong operational growth from lyrica, primarily in the u.s. and japan, and enbrel outside the u.s. and canada, as well as the performance of recently launched products, including eliquis, primarily in the u.s., and xeljanz globally (a combined increase of approximately $270 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $809 million for the first nine months of 2014).the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 1% in the first nine months of 2014 also contributed to the decrease in gip revenues. foreign exchange had no impact on gip revenues in the third quarter of 2014.total gip revenues from emerging markets were $400 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2014.•cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, due to the loss of enbrel alliance revenue after october 31, 2013 when the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired as well as the change in product mix. •selling, informational and administrative expenses increased 6% in the third quarter of 2014 and 9% in the first nine months, compared to the same periods in 2013, reflecting increased investment in recently launched brands and certain in-line products. •research and development expenses increased 33% in the third quarter of 2014 and 34% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, reflecting incremental investment in late-stage pipeline products.•the favorable change in other (income)/deductions––net in the third quarter of 2014 and in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily reflects an increase in royalty-related income, primarily due to royalties earned on sales of enbrel in the u.s. and canada after october 31, 2013. as noted above, on that date, the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for enbrel in the u.s. and canada expired, and pfizer became entitled to royalties for a 36-month period thereafter.global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare operating segment•revenues increased 13% in the third quarter of 2014, and increased 9% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, which includes an increase in operational revenues of 13% in the third quarter of 2014 and 10% in the first nine months of 2014.◦global vaccines revenues increased 19% to $1,140 million in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $954 million in the same period in 2013, and revenues increased 11% to $3,161 million in the first nine months of 2014, compared to $2,847 million in the same period in 2013, reflecting an increase in operational revenues of 19% in the third quarter and 12% in the first nine months of 2014. the increases were primarily due to the performance of prevnar 13 in the u.s., primarily reflecting the timing of government purchasing patterns, increased prices and increased demand. international revenues for the prevenar family increased 11% operationally in the third quarter of 2014 and increased 9% operationally in the first nine months of 2014 which primarily reflects increased shipments associated with the global alliance for vaccines and immunization (gavi) as well as the timing of government purchases in various emerging markets compared with the prior periods, partially offset by lower demand due to adverse weather conditions and decreased stockpile purchases. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on vaccines revenues in the nine months of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013. foreign exchange had no impact on vaccines revenues in the third quarter of 2014.total vaccines revenues from emerging markets were $255 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $758 million in the first nine months of 2014.◦global oncology revenues increased 16% to $551 million in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $473 million in the same period in 2013, and revenues increased 13% to $1,609 million in the first nine months of 2014, compared to $1,422 million in the same period in 2013, reflecting an increase in operational revenues of 17% in the third quarter of 2014 and 14% in the first nine months of 2014, due to continued strong underlying demand of recent product launches, xalkori and inlyta globally, as well as growth from bosulif, primarily in the u.s., and, in the third quarter of 2014, sutent, primarily in emerging markets. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on oncology revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013. total oncology revenues from emerging markets were $91 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $269 million in the first nine months of 2014.83◦consumer healthcare revenues increased 4% to $821 million in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $788 million in the same period in 2013, and revenues increased 4% to $2,494 million in the first nine months of 2014, compared to $2,399 million in the same period in 2013, reflecting an increase in operational revenues of 4% in the third quarter of 2014 and 5% in the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to the launch of nexium 24hr in the u.s. in late-may 2014 and growth of vitamin supplement products in emerging markets, partially offset in the first nine months of 2014 by a decrease in revenues for respiratory products in the u.s. and canada due to a less severe cold and flu incidence, and for advil in the u.s. due to the third quarter 2013 launch of advil film-coated, which triggered increased retail purchases in the year-ago quarter. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on consumer healthcare revenues in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same period in 2013. foreign exchange had no impact on consumer healthcare revenues in the third quarter of 2014.total consumer healthcare revenues from emerging markets were $230 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $692 million in the first nine months of 2014.•cost of sales increased 14% to $475 million in the

period in 2013, primarily due to increased sales volumes. •selling informational and administrative expenses increased 13% in the third quarter of 2014 and 10% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily driven by consumer healthcare expenses incurred to support the launch of nexium 24hr in the u.s. as well as palbociclib and trumenba pre-launch marketing expenses.•research and development expenses decreased 10% in the third quarter of 2014 and 4% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, reflecting lower costs for certain oncology programs, partially offset by increased investment in the palbociclib and trumenba development programs.global established pharmaceutical operating segment•revenues decreased 7%, to $6,239 million in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $6,675 million in the same period in 2013, and decreased 8%, to $18,742 million in the first nine months of 2014, compared to $20,458 million in the same period in 2013, including a decrease in operational revenues of 6% in the third quarter of 2014 and 7% in the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to:◦the loss of exclusivity and subsequent launch of multi-source generic competition for detrol la in the u.s. in january 2014, viagra in most major european markets in june 2013 as well as aricept in canada in december 2013 (aggregate decline of approximately $139 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $490 million in the first nine months of 2014);◦the expiration or near-term expiration of the co-promotion collaboration for spiriva in most countries, including the u.s. (where the collaboration expired in april 2014), which, per the terms of the agreement, has resulted in a decline in pfizer’s share of spiriva revenues (approximately $93 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $396 million in the first nine months of 2014); ◦the operational decline of certain products, including metaxalone and effexor (approximately $24 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $134 million in the first nine months of 2014);◦a decline in branded lipitor revenues in the u.s. and most other developed markets as a result of continued generic competition (approximately $91 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $278 million in the first nine months of 2014); and◦a decline in aricept, not including canada, revenues primarily due to the termination of the co-promotion agreement in japan in december 2012 (approximately $9 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $69 million in the first nine months of 2014); and◦an operational decline due to loss of exclusivity for certain other products in developed markets and steeper generic erosion in japan (approximately $94 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $217 million for the first nine months of 2014),partially offset by:◦the strong operational performance of lyrica, primarily in europe (growth of approximately $47 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $124 million in the first nine months of 2014); ◦the operational growth of lipitor in china (approximately $35 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $124 million in the first nine months of 2014);◦the operational performance of celebrex worldwide (growth of approximately $14 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $58 million in the first nine months of 2014); and◦the contribution from the collaboration with mylan inc. to market generic drugs in japan (approximately $36 million in the first nine months of 2014).84foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on gep revenues in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2014. total gep revenues from emerging markets were $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2014 and $5.4 billion in the first nine months of 2014.•cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, due to the impact of product losses of exclusivity and unfavorable changes in product mix. •selling, informational and administrative expenses decreased 15% in the third quarter of 2014 and 16% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, due to lower expenses for field force, marketing and administrative expenses, reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. •research and development expenses decreased 7% in the third quarter of 2014 and 16% in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same periods in 2013, due to lower clinical trial expenses and the benefits from cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, partially offset by increased spending on biosimilars development programs.•the favorable change in other (income)/deductions––net in the first nine months of 2014 primarily reflects gains on sales of product rights.analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive incomechanges in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the third quarter and first nine months of 2014

other things, decreases due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, but none of these impacts were significant. the following explanations exclude the impact of foreign exchange.•for accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, the change also reflects the timing of collections in the normal course of business.85•for inventories, the change also reflects inventory builds in advance of plant shutdowns/product transfers and new product launches, partially offset by inventory reductions.•for other current assets, the change also reflects the receipt of a portion of the protonix patent litigation settlement income recognized in 2013, a reduction in value added tax (vat) receivables and other receipts in the normal course of business. •for property, plant and

short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable

the dividend rate;•share repurchases;•the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•paying down outstanding debt;•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•business-development activities.our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service (moody's). see the “credit ratings” section below. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities.selected measures of liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table provides

additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the “analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets” and “analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows” sections of this md&a.on may 15, 2014, we completed a public offering of $4.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 7d. financial instruments: long-term debt). 88domestic and international short-term fundsmany of our operations are conducted outside the u.s., and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. we generally hold approximately 10%-30% of these short-term funds in u.s. tax jurisdictions. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s. federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided.accounts receivablewe continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. historically, payments from a number of these european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale. there have been some improvements in the amount of outstanding accounts receivable balances in excess of one year.we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on an analysis of the following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistency of payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).as of september 28, 2014, we had about $907 million in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in italy, spain, greece and portugal where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $105 million, were as follows: $55 million in italy; $22 million in portugal; $17 million in spain, and $11 million in greece.although certain european governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to appropriately balance repayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.we will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1c. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions included in our 2013 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013.credit ratingstwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s and s&p, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:name of rating agency pfizer commercial paper  pfizerlong-term debt date of last rating change rating ratingoutlook moody’s p-1 a1stable october 2009s&p a-1+ aastable october 200989debt capacitywe have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of september 28, 2014, we had access to $8.5 billion of lines of credit, of which $907 million expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.2 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of the unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2019, may be used to support commercial paper borrowings.global economic conditions––generalthe challenging economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future. global economic conditions––venezuela operations our venezuela operations continue to operate with the u.s. dollar as the functional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy. on february 13, 2013, the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 4.3 to 6.3 of venezuelan currency to the u.s. dollar. we incurred a foreign currency loss of $80 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets, and have experienced and expect to continue to experience adverse impacts to our earnings as our revenues and expenses in venezuela continue to be translated into u.s. dollars at the lower 6.3 rate.in the first quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government expanded the number of exchange mechanisms, such that there are now three official rates of exchange. as of september 28, 2014, these were the cencoex rate of 6.3; the sicad i rate at approximately 11.7; and, the sicad ii rate at approximately 50.we continue to use the cencoex rate of 6.3 to report our venezuela financial position, results of operations and cash flows, since we believe that the nature of our business operations in venezuela (the importation, manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products and, to a lesser extent, consumer healthcare goods) would qualify for the most preferential rates permitted by law. we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or whether our use of the 6.3 rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances. further, other potential actions by the venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in venezuela, which could result in an impairment charge and, under extreme circumstances, could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically.as of september 28, 2014, our net monetary assets in venezuela that are subject to revaluation totaled approximately $484 million (remeasured at the 6.3 rate). during the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, our revenues from venezuela totaled approximately $193 million and $535 million, respectively, converted using the 6.3 rate. these amounts may grow in the future.benefit obligationsthe accounting for benefit plans is highly dependent on actuarial estimates, assumptions and calculations, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties. the assumptions and actuarial estimates required to estimate the employee benefit obligations for the defined benefit and postretirement plans may include the discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (life expectancy); and healthcare cost trend rates.on october 27, 2014, the society of actuaries (soa) issued new mortality tables. we use soa life expectancy information when developing the annual mortality assumptions for our benefit plans. while we are still in the process of evaluating the 90potential impact of the new mortality tables, we expect the new information to result in an increase in our u.s. pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations as of december 31, 2014 and an increase in our net periodic benefit costs in 2015. off-balance sheet arrangementsin the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of september 28, 2014, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.share-purchase planon june 27, 2013, we announced that the board of directors had authorized a $10 billion share-purchase plan, and share purchases commenced thereunder in october 2013 (the june 2013 stock purchase plan). on october 23, 2014, we announced that the board of directors had authorized an additional $11 billion share-purchase plan (the october 2014 stock purchase plan). in the first nine months of 2014, we purchased approximately 125 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3.8 billion under our june 2013 stock purchase plan. in the first nine months of 2013, we purchased approximately 411 million shares of our common stock for approximately $11.6 billion under our publicly announced share-purchase plans. after giving effect to share purchases through september 28, 2014, our remaining share-repurchase authorization was approximately $1.7 billion. following the authorization of the october 2014 stock purchase plan of $11 billion, and giving effect to share purchases through october 27, 2014, our remaining share-repurchase authorization was approximately $12.3 billion.dividends on common stockin october 2014, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.26 per share, payable december 2, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on november 7, 2014.new accounting standardsrecently adopted accounting standardssee notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 1b. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: adoption of new accounting standards.recently issued accounting standard, not adopted as of september 28, 2014in august 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued amended guidance related to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, with an effective date of december 31, 2016. the new guidance requires management of all entities to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and, as necessary, to provide related footnote disclosures. we do not expect that the provisions of this new standard will have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.in may 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers, with an effective date of january 1, 2017. early adoption is not permitted. the new guidance introduces a new principles-based framework for revenue recognition and disclosure. we have not yet decided on a method of adoption (full retrospective or modified retrospective basis) and we have not yet determined the potential impact, if any, of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.in april 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance related to discontinued operations, with an effective date of january 1, 2015. the new guidance limits the presentation of discontinued operations to business circumstances when the disposal of the 91business operation represents a strategic shift that has had or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. as required, we will adopt the new provisions on a prospective basis only and we do not expect that the provisions of this new standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.forward-looking information and factors that may affect future resultsthis report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, our anticipated future operating or financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic reviews, capital allocation, plans related to share repurchases and dividends and business-development plans. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans relating to share repurchases and dividends, government regulation and financial results, including, in particular, the financial guidance set forth in the “our financial guidance for 2014” section of this md&a, the anticipated costs and cost savings set forth in the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a and the contributions that we expect to make from our general assets to the company's pension and postretirement plans during 2014 set forth in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 10. pension and postretirement benefit plans. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:•the outcome of research and development activities including, without limitation, the ability to meet anticipated clinical trial commencement and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for product candidates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data;•decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve our drug applications, which will depend on the assessment by such regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted; and decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of our products;•the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;•the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss of marketing approval for a product or changes in the labeling for, and/or increased or new concerns about the safety or efficacy of, a product that could affect its availability or commercial potential;•the success of external business-development activities, including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all;•competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates;•the implementation by the fda of an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products to competition from biosimilar products in the u.s., with attendant competitive pressures, after the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period and patent rights;•the ability to meet generic and branded competition after the loss of patent protection for our products or competitor products;•the ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally;•difficulties or delays in manufacturing;•trade buying patterns;•the impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product exclusivity;•trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment;92•the impact of the u.s. budget control act of 2011 (the budget control act) and the deficit-reduction actions to be taken pursuant to the budget control act in order to achieve the deficit-reduction targets provided for therein, and the impact of any broader deficit-reduction efforts;• the impact of u.s. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010—the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act––and of any modification or repeal of any of the provisions thereof;• u.s. federal or state legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including under medicaid, medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs; the importation of prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries; direct-to-consumer advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals; and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines; as well as pricing pressures as a result of highly competitive insurance markets;•legislation or regulatory action in markets outside the u.s. affecting pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including, in particular, continued government-mandated price reductions for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european and emerging market countries and japan and government-imposed access restrictions in certain countries;•the exposure of our operations outside the u.s. to possible capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, as well as political unrest and unstable governments and legal systems;•contingencies related to actual or alleged environmental contamination;•claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates;•any significant breakdown, infiltration or interruption of our information technology systems and infrastructure;•legal defense costs, insurance expenses, settlement costs, the risk of an adverse decision or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to product liability, patent protection, government investigations, consumer, commercial, securities, antitrust, environmental and tax issues, ongoing efforts to explore various means for resolving asbestos litigation, and other legal proceedings;•our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property, both domestically and internationally;•interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates;•governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations, including, without limitation, tax obligations and changes affecting the tax treatment by the u.s. of income earned outside the u.s. that may result from pending and possible future proposals;•any significant issues involving our largest wholesaler customers, which account for a substantial portion of our revenues;•the possible impact of the increased presence of counterfeit medicines in the pharmaceutical supply chain on our revenues and on patient confidence in the integrity of our medicines;•any significant issues that may arise related to the outsourcing of certain operational and staff functions to third parties, including with regard to quality, timeliness and compliance with applicable legal requirements and industry standards;•any significant issues that may arise related to our joint ventures and other third-party business arrangements;•changes in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles;•uncertainties related to general economic, political, business, industry, regulatory and market conditions including, without limitation, uncertainties related to the impact on us, our customers, suppliers and lenders and counterparties to our foreign-exchange and interest-rate agreements of challenging global economic conditions and recent and possible future changes in global financial markets; and the related risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate;•any changes in business, political and economic conditions due to actual or threatened terrorist activity in the u.s. and other parts of the world, and related u.s. military action overseas;93•growth in costs and expenses;•changes in our product, segment and geographic mix; and•the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internal reorganizations, product recalls and withdrawals and other unusual items, including our ability to realize the projected benefits of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, including those related to our research and development organization, and of the internal separation of our commercial operations into three new global businesses.we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports and our other filings with the sec.our 2013 annual report on form 10-k listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results. we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that form 10-k in this filing and investors should refer to it. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.the operating segment information provided in this report does not purport to represent the revenues, costs and income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income that each of our operating segments would have recorded had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented.this report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body of data. in addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.legal proceedings and contingenciesinformation with respect to legal proceedings and contingencies required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to notes to
