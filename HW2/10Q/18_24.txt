we achieved record quarterly revenue despite softness in the consumer segments of mature markets.
our record revenue coupled with record quarterly operating income helped us achieve operating
income as a percent of revenue of 37.3%, our highest in over ten years. this metric highlights the
strength of our product lineup, strong execution from our factory network, and progress on
improving our cost structure.

our third quarter revenue of $11.1 billion increased 3% from the second quarter and 18% from the
third quarter of 2009. we achieved record microprocessor unit sales in the third quarter on
strength in corporate demand and emerging markets. microprocessor average selling prices remained
flat from the second to the third quarter. our revenue growth from the second quarter was below
average seasonal trends as a result of weakness in the consumer segments of europe and north
america. we expect our revenue growth in the fourth quarter to continue below seasonal trends on
continued weakness in the consumer segments of mature markets and a reduction in customer
inventories in anticipation of the launch of 2nd generation intel®
coretm processor products (formerly code named sandy bridge).

our gross margin percentage for the third quarter declined slightly from the second quarter,
primarily from inventory write-offs of 2nd generation intel core processor products that
have not been qualified for sale. we expect our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter to
increase slightly from the third quarter on the qualification for sale of these new products,
resulting in lower inventory write-offs and sales of previously written-off products. we expect
this increase in gross margin percentage to be partially offset by higher platform (microprocessor
and chipset) unit costs, increased start-up costs, and costs associated with taking older
technology offline.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our “tick-tock” technology development cadence allows us to differentiate our product offerings,
and we expect to ship 32-nanometer process technology products based on our 2nd
generation intel core processor microarchitecture later in the fourth quarter. we believe that
inventory in the supply chain will remain lean as our customers prepare for the launch of these new
products. as we anticipate strong demand for these new products, we are taking advantage of the
lower than expected seasonal growth in the second half of 2010 to more quickly upgrade our older
generation factories.

from a financial condition perspective, we ended the third quarter of 2010 with an investment
portfolio of $20.3 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and
marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. we generated $3.6 billion in cash from
operations during the third quarter, purchased $1.4 billion in capital assets, and returned $877
million to stockholders through dividends. in september, our board of directors declared a dividend
of $.1575 per common share to be paid in december.

during the third quarter, we announced definitive agreements to acquire mcafee, inc., for
approximately $7.68 billion, and infineon’s wireless solutions (wls) business from infineon
technologies ag, for approximately $1.4 billion. for further information, see “note 14: proposed
acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q. the
transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

on
november 2, 2010, the ftc publicly announced the
final approval to a settlement between intel and the ftc that fully
resolves the ftc’s 2009 lawsuit against intel.

strategy

our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital
economy. we believe that the proliferation of the internet and cloud computing have driven
fundamental changes in the computing industry. we are transforming from a company with a primary
focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for pcs and servers to a computing
company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and
supporting services. the number and variety of devices connected to the internet is increasing and
computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience. end users value consistency across
devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the internet and to each other. we will enable
this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing: energy efficient performance,
security, and connectivity.




 
•
 
energy-efficient performance. we are focusing on improved energy-efficient
performance for computing and communications systems and devices. improved energy-efficient
performance involves balancing higher performance with lower power consumption.


 

 
•
 
internet connectivity. we are positioning our business to take advantage of the
growth in devices that compute and connect to the internet. we entered into a definitive
agreement in the third quarter of 2010 to acquire infineon’s wireless solutions (wls)
business. this proposed acquisition would enable us to offer a portfolio of products that
covers a full range of wireless connectivity options by combining our intel® wifi and
intel® wimax technologies with wls’ 2g and 3g technologies, and creating a combined path to
accelerate industry adoption of 4g lte.


 

 
•
 
security. our goal is to enhance security features through the combination of
hardware and software solutions. this may include identity protection and fraud deterrence;
detection and prevention of malware; securing data and assets; as well as system recovery
and enhanced security patching. we entered into a definitive agreement in the third quarter
of 2010 to acquire mcafee inc. we believe this proposed acquisition would accelerate and
enhance the combination of hardware and software security solutions, improving the overall
security of our platforms.



to succeed in the changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives:




 
•
 
strive to ensure that intel technology remains the best choice for the pc as well as
cloud computing and the datacenter.


 

 
•
 
expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring new compelling solutions to the
smartphone, the tablet, the tv, the car, and the rest of the embedded world.


 

 
•
 
enable devices that connect to the internet and to each other to create a continuum of
personal computing. this continuum would give consumers a set of secure, consistent and
personalized computing experiences.


 

 
•
 
positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our
energy-efficient technology.



33



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we will use our core assets to meet these objectives. our core assets include our silicon and
process technology, our architecture and platforms, our global presence, our strong relationships
across the industry, and our brand recognition. we believe that applying these core assets to our
key focus areas provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new
technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly. some of our core assets and key focus areas
are:




 
•
 
silicon and manufacturing technology leadership. we have long been a leader in
silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through
investment and innovation in this critical area. we drive a regular two year upgrade cycle
introducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the next
generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. we refer to this as our
“tick-tock” technology development cadence. as we continue to drive moore’s law over the
next several years, we believe that the value of this advantage will increase.
not only do we aim to have the best process technology, but unlike most semiconductor
companies, we manufacture our products in our own facilities. this allows us to optimize
performance, reduce our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly.


 

 
•
 
architecture and platforms. we are now developing a wide range of solutions for
devices that span the computing continuum from pc’s to smartphones to smart tv’s to
in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. users want computing experiences that are
consistent and devices that are interoperable. users and developers value consistency of
architecture, which provides a common framework that allows for reduced time to market,
with the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. we believe that we
can meet the needs of both users and developers by offering intel® architecture
based computing solutions across the computing continuum. we continue to invest in
improving intel architecture so that we can deliver increased value to our customers in
existing market segments and also expand the capabilities of the architecture to meet end
user and customer needs in adjacent market segments. increasingly, we are delivering our
architecture in the form of platforms. platforms combine not only the microprocessor, but
other critical hardware and software ingredients that are necessary to create computing
solutions. we are expanding our platform capabilities with connectivity solutions, new
forms of user interface, new features and capabilities and complementary software.


 

 
•
 
software. we enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development
tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating
systems that take advantage of our platforms. we seek to expedite growth in various market
segments, such as the embedded and handheld market segments, through our software
offerings. additionally, we have partnered with other companies to develop software
platforms optimized for our intel® atomtm processors and that support multiple
hardware architectures as well as multiple operating systems.


 

 
•
 
customer orientation. our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of
products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. in turn, our products help
enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and
consumers. we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured
to work together to provide an optimized computing solution compared to components that are
used separately. additionally, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield
innovation and improved technologies for users.


 

 
•
 
strategic investments. we make investments in companies around the world that we
believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our
key business initiatives. our investments, including those made through our intel capital
program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in
the digital economy, create new business opportunities for intel, and expand global markets
for our products.


 

 
•
 
stewardship. we are committed to developing energy-efficient technology
solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our
environmental impact. we are also committed to helping transform education globally through
our technology, program and policy leadership, and investments by the intel foundation. in
addition, we strive to cultivate a work environment where engaged, energized employees can
thrive in their job and in their communities.



our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will
strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into these new market segments. we
believe that these new market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of
microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers. we also believe that increased
internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing creates a need for greater server
infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and
virtualization.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

critical accounting estimates

the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial
statements. some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.
our most critical accounting estimates include:




 
•
 
the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments,
net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;


 

 
•
 
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross
margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their
depreciation;


 

 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including
the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and


 

 
•
 
the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin.



below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.

non-marketable equity investments

we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from
early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature
companies with established revenue streams and business models. the carrying value of our
non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.7 billion as
of september 25, 2010 ($3.4 billion as of december 26, 2009). the majority of this balance as of
september 25, 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. our flash
memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies, llc (imft) and
im flash singapore, llp (imfs) of $1.5 billion ($1.6 billion as of december 26, 2009). for further
information, see “note 10: equity method and cost method investments” in the notes to consolidated
condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of
accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable equity
investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance
sheets.

non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product
development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, other key business factors, and the ability
of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile. the
companies could fail, or not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they
may receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings.
these events could cause our investments to become impaired. in addition, financial market
volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through
liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. for further
information about our investment portfolio risks, see “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of this
form 10-q.

we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure
purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is
recognized. we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market
and income approaches. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of
comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance
multiples. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a
number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, development
stages, and other relevant factors. the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow
model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following
significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed
market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the
risk profile of comparable companies. estimates of market segment size, market segment share,
expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and/or intel using
historical data and available market data. the valuation of our non-marketable investments also
takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing
activities by the investees, the investees’ capital structure, and differences in seniority and
rights associated with the investees’ capital structure.

35



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

for non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment
and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that
impact the fair value of the investment, such as:




 
•
 
the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones
and overall business prospects;


 

 
•
 
the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;


 

 
•
 
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area,
including adverse regulatory or economic changes;


 

 
•
 
factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the
investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash;
and


 

 
•
 
the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.



if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is
other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes
assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before
disposal. if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the
investment to its fair value. impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $32 million in
the third quarter of 2010 ($95 million in the first nine months of 2010). over the past 12
quarters, including the third quarter of 2010, impairments of non-marketable equity investments
ranged from $11 million to $896 million per quarter. this range included impairments of $896
million during the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on
our investment in clearwire communications, llc (clearwire llc).

imft/imfs

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand
products to intel and micron technology, inc. at manufacturing cost. we determine the fair value of
our investment in imft/imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business, which requires the use of
unobservable inputs. unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective
judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. changes in management
estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value
determination. we have not had an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in imft/imfs.
it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in
the near term, which could result in an impairment of our investment.

long-lived assets

we assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. factors that we
consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of
a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic
trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. we measure the
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying
value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash
flows. if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted
cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is measured by
comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. fair value
is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and
property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are recorded at fair value
only if an impairment charge is recognized.

impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of
identifiable independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of
our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the
independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective
judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor
manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the
assets’ new, shorter useful lives. over the past 12 quarters, including the third quarter of 2010,
impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $10 million to $300
million per quarter.

income taxes

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement
purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and
deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from
differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement
purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant
changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a
subsequent period.

36



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery
is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we
will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated
condensed balance sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred
tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery
was not likely. recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans
with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s
plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for
taxes.

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we
determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step
requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to
estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we
re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors
such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively
settled issues. determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires
judgment. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax
benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

inventory

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
inventory that is not of saleable quality. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory
requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. the estimate of future demand is
compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. as of september 25, 2010, our work-in-process inventory totaled $1.6
billion and finished goods inventory totaled $1.4 billion. the demand forecast is included in the
development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation
and build decisions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation
process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products,
consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the
selling price in relation to the product cost. if our demand forecast for specific products is
greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be
required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.

in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine
normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings
of wafers compared to total available capacity. if the factory loadings are below the established
normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the
cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would
negatively impact our gross margin. we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. over the
past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter.

accounting changes and recent accounting standards

for a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected
dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated condensed financial
statements, see “note 2: accounting changes” and “note 3: recent accounting standards” in the notes
to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our net revenue for q3 2010 increased $1.7 billion, or 18%, compared to q3 2009. the increase was
due to higher microprocessor average selling prices and unit sales. revenue in the japan, americas,
and asia-pacific regions increased by 23%, 23%, and 20% respectively compared to q3 2009. revenue
in the europe region was approximately flat compared to q3 2009.

our overall gross margin dollars for q3 2010 increased $1.9 billion, or 35%, compared to q3 2009.
the increase was primarily due to higher revenue, lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit
cost, and excess capacity charges recorded in q3 2009. our overall gross margin percentage
increased to 65.9% in q3 2010 from 57.6% in q3 2009. the increase in gross margin percentage was
primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the pc client group operating
segment and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin percentage increase in the data center group
operating segment. we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2010
and q3 2009, from the sale of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group
operating segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased $1.0 billion, or 14%, in q3 2010 compared to
q3 2009. microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those designed for the notebook, netbook,
and desktop computing market segments. significantly higher notebook average selling prices was the
primary driver of the increase in microprocessor revenue. to a lesser extent, higher notebook unit
sales and higher desktop average selling prices also contributed to the increase. the decrease in
chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly lower revenue from the sale of
wireless communication products. slightly higher chipset unit sales were partially offset by
slightly lower chipset average selling prices.

operating income increased by $1.2 billion, or 53%, in q3 2010 compared to q3 2009. the increase in
operating income was primarily due to higher revenue. to a lesser extent, lower platform unit cost
in q3’10, and excess capacity charges of approximately $110 million in q3 2009 that were primarily
related to microprocessors and chipsets contributed to the increase. these increases to operating
income were partially offset by higher operating expenses.

data center group

the revenue and operating income for the data center group (dcg) operating segment for q3 2010 and
q3 2009 were as follows:

net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by $510 million, or 30%, in q3 2010 compared to
q3 2009. the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly higher microprocessor unit
sales and higher average selling prices. the increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue
was due to higher revenue from the sale of wired connectivity products and higher chipset unit
sales.

operating income increased by $443 million, or 71%, in q3 2010 compared to q3 2009. the increase in
operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. this increase to operating
income was partially offset by higher operating expenses.

other intel architecture operating segments

the revenue and operating income for the other intel architecture (other ia) operating segments for
q3 2010 and q3 2009 were as follows and includes the embedded and communications group, digital

net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by $157 million, or 46%, in q3 2010
compared to q3 2009. the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue within the
embedded and communications group (ecg) from significantly higher microprocessor and chipset unit
sales, and higher microprocessor average selling prices. these increases to ecg revenue were
partially offset by a decrease in chipset average selling prices.

operating income (loss) for the other ia operating segments decreased from a $55 million loss in q3
2009 to break even in q3 2010. the operating loss decrease was primarily due to significantly
higher ecg revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses in ecg and the ultra-mobility
group.

research and development. r&d spending increased by $245 million, or 17%, in q3 2010 compared to
q3 2009 primarily due to an increase in employees, higher profit-dependent compensation, and higher
assembly and design development costs.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by
$186 million, or 14%, in q3 2010 compared to q3 2009 primarily due to higher advertising expenses
(including cooperative advertising expenses) and higher profit-dependent compensation.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 29% of net revenue in q3
2010 and q3 2009.

fair value losses on the equity interest in micron we received from the sale of our ownership
interest in numonyx b.v., partially offset by equity options that economically hedge a portion of our
micron equity interest.

the effective tax rate for q3 2010 was negatively impacted by a higher percentage of profits being
derived from higher tax jurisdictions compared to q3 2009. the q3 2009 effective tax rate was
negatively impacted by adjustments for differences between our finalized tax return and the
provision recorded, and other adjustments to tax provisions from prior years, which were partially
offset by settlements and effective settlements of various uncertain tax positions.

our net revenue for the first nine months of 2010 increased $7.6 billion, or 31%, compared to the
first nine months of 2009. the increase was due to significantly higher microprocessor and chipset
unit sales, as well as higher microprocessor average selling prices. revenue in the japan,
asia-pacific, americas, and europe regions increased by 40%, 38%, 26%, and 7% respectively compared
to the first nine months of 2009.

our overall gross margin dollars increased by $8.4 billion, or 66%, compared to the first nine
months of 2009. the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. to a lesser extent,
excess capacity charges recorded in the first nine months of 2009 of $1.1 billion, and lower
platform unit cost contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for the first nine months of
2010 compared to the first nine months of 2009. our overall gross margin percentage increased to
65.6% in the first nine months of 2010 from 51.8% in the first nine months of 2009. the increase in
gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the
pc client group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, gross margin percentage increases in the
data center group and nand solutions group operating segments. we derived a substantial majority of
our overall gross margin dollars in the first nine months of 2010 and the first nine months of
2009, from the sale of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group operating
segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

significantly higher notebook unit sales was the primary driver of the increase in microprocessor
revenue. to a lesser extent, higher desktop unit sales and higher notebook average selling prices
also contributed to the increase. the increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due
to significantly higher chipset unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower revenue from
the sale of wireless communication products.

operating income increased by $5.8 billion in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the first
nine months of 2009. the increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher
revenue. during the first nine months of 2009, we recorded excess capacity charges of approximately
$1.0 billion, primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets. additionally, lower platform unit
cost in the first nine months of 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income. these
increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses in the first nine months of 2010

significantly higher revenue within the embedded and communications group (ecg) from significantly
higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales.

operating loss for the other ia operating segments decreased by $144 million in the first nine
months of 2010 compared to the first nine months of 2009. the operating loss decrease was primarily
due to significantly higher ecg revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses in ecg and

research and development. r&d spending increased by $855 million, or 21%, in the first nine months
of 2010 compared to the first nine months of 2009 primarily due to higher profit-dependent
compensation, higher process development costs, and an increase in employees.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased by
$609 million, or 12%, in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the first nine months of 2009
due to the q2 2009 charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the
european commission (ec). this decrease was partially offset by higher advertising expenses
(including cooperative advertising expenses), higher profit-dependent compensation, and to a lesser
extent, expenses related to our wind river software group operating segment.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in the
first nine months of 2010 (38% of net revenue in the first nine months of 2009).

we recognized higher gains on sales and lower equity method losses in the first nine months of 2010
compared to the first nine months of 2009.

during the first nine months of 2010, we recognized a gain of $33 million on the initial public
offering of smart technologies, included within “equity method losses, net,” and a gain of $148
million on the subsequent sale of our shares in the secondary offering, included in “other, net,”
resulting in a total gain of $181 million. we also recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of
our ownership interest in numonyx. for further information, see “note 10: equity method and cost
method investments” in the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements in this form
10-q. equity method losses, net also includes clearwire llc ($81 million loss in the first nine
months of 2010 and $43 million loss in the first nine months of 2009) and numonyx ($42 million gain
in the first nine months of 2010 and $46 million loss in the first nine months of 2009).

we recognized higher gains on sales and lower impairment charges on non-marketable equity

on equity investments in the first nine months of 2010 included a gain of $67 million on the q1
2010 sale of shares in micron. “other, net” for the first nine months of 2010 includes fair value
losses on the equity interest in micron we received from the sale of our ownership interest in
numonyx in q2 2010 offset by gains on equity options established prior to the numonyx sale that
economically hedge a portion of our micron equity interest.

interest income was lower in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the first nine months of
2009 as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances.
the average interest rate earned during the first nine months of 2010 decreased by approximately
one half of a percentage point compared to the first nine months of 2009. we recognized $10 million
of fair value gains on our marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets in the first
nine months of 2010 compared to $55 million of fair value gains in the first nine months of 2009.
in addition, we recognized currency exchange rate losses in the first nine months of 2009 due to
euro exposure related to our euro-denominated liability for the european commission (ec) fine.

provision for taxes

our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows:

effective tax rate

the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was negatively impacted by a higher
percentage of our profits being derived from higher-tax jurisdictions compared to the first nine
months of 2009. the ec fine incurred in the second quarter of 2009 was not tax deductible. for
further information on the ec fine, see “note 24: contingencies.” the ec fine of $1.447 billion,
with no associated reduction in the provision for taxes, significantly increased our effective tax
rate for the first nine months of 2009. the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2009
was also negatively impacted by adjustments for differences between our finalized tax return and
the provision recorded, and other adjustments to tax provisions from prior years. these negative
impacts to our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2009 were partially offset by the
reversal of previously accrued taxes related to settlements and effective settlements that
positively impacted the rate in the first nine months of 2009.

status of business outlook

we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with
investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking
statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q, including
any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. at the same time, we will
keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor
relations web site at www.intc.com. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook
published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we
publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the “business outlook” section and other
forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year
in our quarterly earnings releases and securities and exchange commission (sec) filings and at
other times.

from the close of business on november 24, 2010 until our quarterly earnings release is published,
presently scheduled for january 13, 2011, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet
period, the “business outlook” section and other forward-looking statements first published in our
form 8-k filed on october 12, 2010, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q,
should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to
update. during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or
our financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period,
and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes
in assets and liabilities.

cash from operations for the first nine months of 2010 was $11.1 billion, an increase of $3.4
billion compared to the first nine months of 2009 due to higher net income, partially offset by
adjustments for non-cash items and changes in our working capital. income taxes paid, net of
refunds, in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the first nine months of 2009 were $3.4
billion higher on higher income before taxes in 2010 and timing of refunds received.

changes in assets and liabilities as of september 25, 2010 compared to december 26, 2009 included
the following:




 
•
 
accounts receivable increased due to a higher proportion of sales at the end of the
third quarter of 2010.






 
•
 
inventories increased due to higher microprocessor inventory.



for the first nine months of 2010, our two largest customers accounted for 37% of net revenue (39%
for the first nine months of 2009) with one of those customers accounting for 20% of our net
revenue, and another customer accounting for 17% of our net revenue. these two largest customers
accounted for 32% of net accounts receivable at september 25, 2010 (41% at december 26, 2009).

investing activities

the increase in cash used for investing activities in the first nine months of 2010, compared to
the first nine months of 2009, was due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale
investments, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions.

financing activities

the increase in cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2010, compared to
the first nine months of 2009, was due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2009, partially offset
by a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock.

liquidity

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. as of september 25, 2010,
cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term
investments totaled $20.3 billion. in addition to the $20.3 billion, we have $4.3 billion in loans
receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio.

the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high. substantially all of our investments
in debt instruments are with a/a2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the
issuers are rated aa-/aa3 or better.

48



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing
authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the
issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the
first nine months of 2010 were $150 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as
of september 25, 2010. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s
as of september 25, 2010. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the
sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next
12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test,
working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions
or strategic investments.

fair value of financial instruments

fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when
determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would
transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or
liability. see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of
this form 10-q.

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at
fair value on a recurring basis. when fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a
discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk and/or intel’s credit risk is factored into
the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate.

marketable debt instruments

as of september 25, 2010, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
included $23.5 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $5.3 billion was
classified as level 1, $17.9 billion as level 2, and $341 million as level 3.

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable
market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. management judgment was
required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market
to be considered active. our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments
generally takes into consideration activity of each individual instrument, including the number of
days each individual instrument trades over a specified period.

of the $17.9 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on
a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 45% of the balance was classified as
level 2 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 55% due to the usage of
non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data.

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to
corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when
observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and
non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. all of our investments in
asset-backed securities were classified as level 3, and substantially all of them were valued using
non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market
data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities.

equity securities

as of september 25, 2010, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis included $1.5 billion of marketable equity securities (including marketable equity
securities receivable). of these securities, $818 million was classified as level 1 because the
valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment
of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration
activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for individual
securities, including the number of days individual equity securities trade and the average weekly
trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security. the remaining
marketable equity securities of $721 million were classified as level 2 because their valuations
were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for
security-specific restrictions.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

contractual obligations

in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding
common shares of mcafee, inc. for $48.00 per share in cash to be paid to the stockholders of
mcafee. as of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of
$7.68 billion. for further information, see “note 14: proposed acquisitions” in the notes to
consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q. the transaction is subject to
certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement with infineon technologies ag
to acquire infineon’s wireless solutions (wls) business for approximately $1.4 billion in cash. the
transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
