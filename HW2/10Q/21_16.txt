item 2.  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe following discussion and analysis supplements management's discussion and analysis of mastercard incorporated for the year ended december 31, 2012 as contained in the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 14, 2013.  it also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated, included elsewhere in this report.  certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.  percentage changes provided throughout "management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.overview mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  we make payments more convenient, secure and efficient by creating solutions that meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, and thereby drive preference for electronic payments.  we offer a wide range of payment solutions that enable the development and implementation of credit, debit, prepaid, commercial and related payment programs and solutions for consumers and merchants.  our customers encompass a vast array of entities, including financial institutions and other entities that act as “issuers” and “acquirers”, merchants, governments, telecommunications companies and other businesses.  we manage a family of well-known, widely-accepted payment brands, including mastercard, maestro and cirrus, which our customers use in their payment programs and solutions.  we process payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network and provide support services to our customers and others.  we establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payments network.  we generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.  changes in cardholder spending behavior, influenced by economic conditions, impact our ability to grow our revenue.  our revenue depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending.  while cardholder and merchant relationships are generally managed by our customers, we work with merchants to help provide value to them and benefits to consumers.  we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the "merchant discount" rate charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands.our ability to grow is based on three drivers: •personal consumption expenditure growth;•the trend within the global payments industry from paper-based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment (such as those made via payment cards and other devices); and•our share in electronic payments through innovative solutions and new technology.we support our focus on these drivers by continuing to:•grow our core businesses globally, including credit, debit, prepaid and commercial programs and solutions, as well as the processing of payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network;•diversify our business by seeking new areas of growth in markets around the world, expanding points of acceptance globally, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance, and deepening existing relationships or entering into new relationships with payments industry participants, such as merchants, governments and telecommunications companies; and•build new businesses through technology and continued strategic efforts and alliances focused on innovative payment methods like electronic commerce (e-commerce) and mobile capabilities.see “-business environment” for a discussion of considerations related to our long-term strategic objectives. we recorded net income of $848 million, or $6.96 per diluted share, and $1.6 billion, or $13.19 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, respectively, versus net income of $700 million, or $5.55 per diluted share, and $1.4 billion, or $10.91 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2012, respectively.  25table of contentsour net revenue increased 15% and 12% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2012, primarily driven by increased growth in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and the number of transactions processed by the company.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, both volume-based revenue (domestic assessments and cross-border volume fees) and transaction-based revenue (transaction processing fees) increased from the comparable period in 2012 by 11%.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, our processed transactions increased 11% and 12%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2012.  our volumes increased 13% for each of the three and six month periods ended june 30, 2013, on a local currency basis, versus the comparable periods in 2012.  this compares to increased processed transactions of 29% for each of the three and six month periods ended june 30, 2012 versus the comparable periods in 2011.  volumes increased 15% and 17% on a local currency basis for the three and six months ended june 30, 2012, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2011.  rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenue were 24% and 25% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, versus 26% and 25%, respectively, for the comparable periods in 2012.operating expenses increased 2% and 4% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013 versus the comparable periods in 2012, primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses.  we generated net cash flows from operations of $1.6 billion for the six months ended june 30, 2013, compared to $1.1 billion for the comparable period in 2012.  the following

generated in the united states was 41% and 40% of total revenue for the three months ended june 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 40% of total revenue for each of the six month periods ended june 30, 2013 and 2012.  no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total revenue in any such period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time.  while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  unprecedented economic events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world, including continued distress in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention.  the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world have been significantly impacted by this economic turmoil.  countries have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies, including several in europe as well as the united states.  in addition, some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or 26table of contentshave a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments.  many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential further changes in laws and regulations.  many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted.mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  in addition, further political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  as a result, our revenue may be negatively impacted, or the company may be impacted in several ways.  mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry.  notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business.  for further discussion see, "risk factors - business risks" in part i, item 1a of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2012.in addition, our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries.  regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry.  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and our risk factors in "risk factors - legal and regulatory risks" in part i, item 1a of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2012 for further discussion.  further, information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years.  although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future.  see our risk factor in "risk factors - business risks" in part i, item 1a of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2012 related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks. impact of foreign currency ratesour overall operating results can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real.  the functional currency of mastercard europe, our principal european operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real.  accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the u.s. dollar.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, as compared to the same period in 2012, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the brazilian real but weakened against the euro.  the net foreign currency impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real reduced net revenue by less than 1 percentage point for the three months ended june 30, 2013 and increased net revenue by less than 1 percentage point  for the six months ended june 30, 2013.  operating expenses were impacted by less than 1 percentage point for each of the three and six months ended june 30, 2013.  in addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives.  in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus primarily non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies.  the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, as compared to the same periods in 2012, gdv on a u.s. dollar converted basis increased 13% and 12% versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 13% for each of the three and six month periods ended june 30, 2012.  the company attempts to limit the impact from these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation.  while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis, they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the u.s. dollar.27table of contentsrevenuerevenue descriptionmastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders’ financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions).  our gross revenue is typically generated from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.  our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers.  our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes, types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers.  the following are some of the factors that impact pricing:•domestic or cross-border•signature-based (credit and debit) or pin-based (debit, including automated teller machine (“atm”) cash withdrawals and retail purchases)•tiered rates that fluctuate based on volume/transaction hurdles•geographic region or country•retail purchase or cash withdrawal•processed or not processed by mastercardin general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis.  in addition, standard pricing varies among our regions, and such standard pricing can be modified for our customers through customer-specific incentive and rebate agreements.the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories:1.domestic assessments: domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same. a portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price.  in addition, domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.  acceptance development fees are charged primarily to u.s. issuers based on components of volume, and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale.  market development fees are charged primarily to issuers and acquirers based on components of volume, and support our focus on building brand awareness and card activation, increasing purchase volumes, cross-border card usage, and other general marketing purposes.2.cross-border volume fees: cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different.  cross-border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases and cash disbursements) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price.  cross-border volume fees also include fees charged to issuers for performing currency conversion services.3.transaction processing fees: transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions.  these fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service.  transaction processing fees include charges for the following:•transaction switching – authorization, clearing and settlement.◦authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval and then a decision whether or not to approve the transaction is made by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or 28table of contentsapplicable rules (also known as "stand-in").  our standards, which may vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions.  fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers.◦clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.  fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers.◦settlement. once transactions have been authorized and cleared, mastercard helps to settle the transactions by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.  once clearing is completed, a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement, detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position.  fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers.•connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages.  these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company’s network.4.other revenues: other revenues for other payment-related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors, such as contractual agreements.  examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following:•cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with mastercard-branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating atms.•consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company’s professional advisory services group.  the company’s business agreements with certain customers and merchants may include consulting services.  •fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions.  this includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants.•program management services provided to prepaid card issuers.  this primarily includes foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.  •the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related services, including rules compliance, account and transaction enhancement services, holograms and publications.5.rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue in the same period that revenue is earned or performance occurs.  performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive, including commitments to the agreement term, hurdles for volumes, transactions or issuance of new cards, launch of new programs, or the execution of marketing programs.  rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance, the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements.revenue analysisin the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, gross revenue increased $290 million and $523 million, or 12% and 11%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2012.  gross revenue growth in the three and six months ended june 30, 2013 was primarily driven by increased growth in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, increased transactions and pricing initiatives.  rebates and incentives in the three and six months ended june 30, 2013 increased $14 million and $99 million, or 2% and 8%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2012 due to the impact from new, renewed and expired agreements.  our net revenue increased 15% and 12% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2012.our revenue is primarily based on volumes and transactions, which are driven by the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices carrying our brands and the number of transactions.  during the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, our processed transactions increased 11% and 12%, respectively, and our gdv increased 13% on a local currency basis for each of the periods.  29table of contentsthe following table provides a summary of the trend in volume growth:  three months

portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers.  the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue.  in addition, as part of our business strategy, mastercard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers.  these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. the significant

benefits costs, including increased compensation related to an increase in the number of employees to support the company's strategic initiatives.•professional fees consist primarily of third-party services, legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and the evaluation of regulatory developments that impact our industry and company.  professional fees decreased 14% and 9% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2013, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2012, primarily due to reduced third-party service expenses.•data processing and telecommunications expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other telecommunication needs.  these expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage.  •foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts  and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  see note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.  since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize. •other expenses include costs to provide loyalty and rewards programs, travel and entertainment, rental expense for our facilities, litigation settlements not related to the u.s. merchant class litigation and other miscellaneous operating expenses.advertising and marketingour brands, principally mastercard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally.  our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotional, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale.  we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences.  advertising and marketing expenses increased $7 million and $11 million, or 3%, for  each of the three and six months ended june 30, 2013 versus the comparable periods in 2012, mainly due to new and renewed sponsorships.depreciation
