item 2.  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated (“mastercard international”) (together, “mastercard” or the “company”), included elsewhere in this report. percentage changes provided throughout "management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.overviewmastercard is a global payments and technology company that connects billions of consumers, thousands of financial institutions, millions of merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  we envision an environment where electronic payment is the predominant means of payment.  we use our technology and expertise to make payments more convenient, secure and efficient to enable consumers to meet their needs and to provide value to all stakeholders in the payments system.we offer a wide range of payment solutions that enable our customers and partners to develop and implement credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs and solutions to deliver value to consumers.  our customers and partners include financial institutions and other entities that act as “issuers” and “acquirers”, merchants, government entities, telecommunications companies and other businesses.  we manage a family of well-known, widely-accepted payment brands, including mastercard, maestro and cirrus, which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs and solutions.  we process payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network and provide support services to our customers and other partners.  as part of managing our brands, we establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payments network.  we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.  as cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers,  we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards and other devices that carry our brands.we analyze our ability to grow based on three drivers: •we track trends in personal consumption expenditures;•we focus on the trend within the global payments industry from paper-based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment (such as payment card transactions); and•we seek to grow our share in electronic payments, including with innovative solutions and new technology.we support our focus on these drivers by continuing to:•grow our core businesses globally, including credit, debit, prepaid, commercial and processing payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network;•diversify our business by seeking new areas of growth in markets around the world, expanding points of acceptance for our brands throughout the world, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance, and working with new partners such as merchants, government agencies and telecommunications companies; and•build new businesses through technology and continued strategic efforts and alliances with respect to innovative payment methods, such as electronic commerce (e-commerce) and mobile capabilities.see “-business environment” for a discussion of considerations related to our long-term strategic objectives. we recorded net income of $772 million, or $6.17 per diluted share, and $2.2 billion, or $17.07 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus net income of $717 million, or $5.63 per diluted share, and net income of $1.9 billion, or $14.66 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively.  in addition, for the nine months ended september 30, 2012, we generated cash flows from operations of $2.1 billion.our net revenues increased 5% and 10% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2011, primarily due to the increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased 24table of contentstransactions, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.  the net effects of pricing actions contributed approximately 2 and 3 percentage points to our net revenue growth for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively.  the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of revenues from our functional currencies to u.s. dollars reduced net revenues by approximately 5 and 4 percentage points for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively.  rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were 26% for each of the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, versus 24% for each of the comparable periods in 2011.our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending.  changes in cardholder spending behavior, influenced by economic conditions, impact our ability to grow our revenues.  our revenues are primarily impacted by the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands, and the number of transactions.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, volume-based revenues (domestic assessments and cross-border volume fees) and transaction-based revenues (transaction processing fees) increased from the comparable periods in 2011.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, our processed transactions increased 24% and 27%, respectively, and our volumes increased 14% and 16%, respectively, on a local currency basis compared to the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011.  this compares to increased processed transactions of 21% and 17% and increased volumes of 18% and 16% on a local currency basis for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended september 30, 2010.  our operating expenses increased 5% and 9% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2011, primarily due to greater general and administrative expenses.  the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of expenses from our functional currencies to u.s. dollars reduced operating expenses by approximately 3 and 2 percentage points for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively. our ratios of operating income as a percentage of net revenues, or operating margins, were 55.5% and 55.3% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus operating margins of 55.1% and 54.6% in the comparable periods of 2011.  the effective income tax rates were 27.6% and 29.1% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus effective income tax rates of 30.5% and 31.6% for the comparable periods of 2011.business environment we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies.  net revenue generated in the united states was approximately 40% of total revenue for each of the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012 and 2011.  no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total revenues in either period, but differences in market growth, economic health, and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time.  while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  unprecedented events which began during 2008 continue to impact the financial markets around the world, including continued distress in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention.  the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world have been significantly impacted by this economic turmoil.  countries have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies, including several in europe as well as the united states.  in addition, some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments.  many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential further changes in laws and regulations.  many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted.mastercard’s financial results may be adversely impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  the condition of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  as a result, our revenue may be impacted, or the company may be impacted in several ways.  for a full discussion see "risk factors - business risks - unprecedented global economic events in financial markets around the world have directly and adversely affected, and may continue to affect, many of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, which could result in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business" in part i, item 1a of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2011 and part ii, item 1a, (risk factors) of the company's quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarter ended june 30, 2012 for further discussion.25table of contentsin addition, our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries.  regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry.  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion.mastercard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry.  despite mixed economic indicators, we continue to see growth in all of our regions.  notwithstanding recent trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business. financial resultsour operating results for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: three months endedseptember 30, percent increase

represents total number of transactions processed by mastercard and growth from the comparable periods.impact of foreign currency ratesour overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real.  the functional currency of mastercard europe, our principal european operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real.  accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the u.s. dollar.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, as compared to the same periods in 2011, the u.s. dollar strengthened against both the euro and the brazilian real.  accordingly, the net foreign currency impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real reduced net revenues by approximately 5 and 4 percentage points and operating expenses by approximately 3 and 2 percentage points for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively.  26table of contentsin addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives.  in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar and euro.  the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, as compared to the same periods in 2011, gdv on a u.s. dollar converted basis increased 9% and 11%, respectively, versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 14% and 16%.during 2011 and the first nine months of 2012, approximately 60% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the united states.  some of the revenue we generate outside the united states is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations (including devaluations of currencies).  our hedging activities attempt to protect against adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies.  furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of currencies into u.s. dollars.  the occurrence of any of these factors could impact the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and could have a material adverse impact on our business.  we manage these foreign currency risks by entering into foreign currency derivative contracts.  to manage our anticipated cash flow exposures for certain currencies, we utilize a rolling hedge program to reduce the anticipated foreign exchange risk.  our foreign currency risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements over time.  changes in foreign exchange rates affect the fair value of foreign currency derivatives entered into pursuant to our hedging activities.  since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activity, any changes in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives could result in gains or losses as the company records these derivatives at fair value on a current basis.  foreign exchange gains and losses are included within our net income.  see note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion.revenuesrevenue descriptionsmastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders’ financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions).  our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands, the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment-related services we provide to our customers.  our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers.  our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.we process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders with the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, mastercard cards across multiple country borders.  we process most of the cross-border transactions using mastercard, maestro and cirrus-branded cards and  process the majority of mastercard-branded domestic transactions in the united states, united kingdom, canada, brazil and a select number of other smaller countries.our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes, types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers.  a combination of the following factors determines the pricing:•domestic or cross-border•signature-based (credit and debit) or pin-based (debit, including automated teller machine (“atm”) cash withdrawals and retail purchases)•tiered pricing, with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume/transaction hurdles•geographic region or country•retail purchase or cash withdrawal•processed or not processed by mastercardin general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis.  in addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be modified for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements.27table of contentsthe company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories:1.domestic assessments: domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the acquirer country and the issuer country are the same. a portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price.  in addition, domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.  acceptance development fees are charged primarily to u.s. issuers based on components of volume, and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale.  market development fees are charged primarily to issuers and acquirers based on components of volume, and support our focus on building brand awareness and card activation, increasing purchase volumes, cross-border card usage, and other general marketing purposes.2.cross-border volume fees: cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different.  cross-border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases and cash disbursements) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price.  cross-border volume fees also include fees charged to issuers for performing currency conversion services.3.transaction processing fees: transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions.  these fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service.  transaction processing fees include charges for the following:•transaction switching – authorization, clearing and settlement.a.authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval and then a decision whether or not to approve the transaction is made by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or applicable rules (also known as "stand-in").  our standards, which may vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions.  fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers.b.clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.  mastercard clearing solutions can be managed with minimal system development, which has enabled us to accelerate our customers' ability to develop customized programs and services.  fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers.c.settlement. once transactions have been authorized and cleared, mastercard helps to settle the transactions by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.  once clearing is completed, a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement, detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position.  fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers.•connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages.  these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company’s network.4.other revenues: other revenues for other payment-related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors, such as contractual agreements.  examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following:•fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions.  this includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants.•cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with mastercard-branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines.28table of contents•consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company’s professional advisory services group.  •program management services provided to prepaid card issuers.  this primarily includes foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees, and atm withdrawal fees charged to cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.  •the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related services, including rules compliance, account and transaction enhancement services, holograms and publications.5.rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue in the same period that performance occurs.  performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive, including commitments to the agreement term, hurdles for volumes, transactions or issuance of new cards, launch of new programs, or the execution of marketing programs.  rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance, the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements.revenue analysisgross revenues increased $213 million and $862 million, or 9% and 13%, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2011, primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions.  rebates and incentives increased $113 million and $352 million, or 20% and 22% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2011.  our net revenues increased 5% and 10% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus the comparable periods in

for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively.  the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of revenues from our functional currencies to u.s. dollars reduced net revenues by approximately 5 and 4 percentage points for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively.the significant components of our net revenues for the three and nine

increase was primarily due to higher salary and benefits costs, including increased compensation related to an increase in the number of employees to support the company's strategic initiatives.•foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts  and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  see note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.  since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis in general and administrative expenses, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize. •other expenses include travel and entertainment expenses, rental expense for our facilities, cardholder services expenses, certain operational expenses associated with the operations of access, and other 31table of contentsmiscellaneous operating expenses.  other expenses increased for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012 versus the comparable periods in 2011 primarily due to the increased expenses associated with the access operations, for which the company did not have comparable expenses in the first quarter of 2011, and other increased operating expenses associated with expanding business operations.  advertising and marketingour brands, principally mastercard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally.  our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotional, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale.  we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences.  advertising and marketing expenses decreased  $24 million, or 12%, and $42 million, or 8%, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2011, mainly due to the impact of foreign currency and the timing of sponsorship and promotional initiatives.  the net impact of foreign currency relating to the translation of advertising and marketing expenses from our functional currencies to u.s. dollars reduced advertising and marketing expenses by approximately 4  percentage points for each of the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012.depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expenses increased $7 million, or 14%, and $26 million, or 18%, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2012, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2011.  the increases in depreciation and amortization expenses reflected increased capitalized software associated with strategic projects and the amortization of intangible assets from the 2011 acquisition of access.provision for litigation settlementon july 13, 2012, the company announced that it had agreed to a memorandum of understanding to settle the u.s. merchant litigations.  during the nine months ended september 30, 2012, the company accrued an additional $20 million pre-tax charge related to the u.s. merchant litigations.  mastercard previously recorded a $770 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the u.s merchant litigations.  the total accrued liability of $790 million represents an estimate of the company's financial liability to settle the u.s. merchant litigations.  there were no comparable charges in the nine months ended september 30, 2011.  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion. other income (expense)other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses.  the decrease of $26 million for the three months ended september 30, 2012 in other net income versus the comparable period in 2011 was primarily due to lower realized gains on sales of investments, an adjustment to the earnout related to the company's acquisition of access in the third quarter of 2011 and increased expenses from investments in joint ventures in the third quarter of 2012.the decrease of $35 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2012 in other net income versus the comparable period in 2011 was primarily due to to lower realized gains on sales of investments, increased expenses from investments in joint ventures in the third quarter of 2012 and an adjustment to the earnout related to the company's acquisition of access in the third quarter of 2011.income taxes the effective income tax rates were 27.6% and 30.5% for the three months ended september 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 29.1% and 31.6% for the nine months ended september 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  the tax rate for the three months ended september 30, 2012 was lower than the tax rate for the three months ended september 30, 2011 due primarily to a discrete benefit related to additional export incentives and a larger benefit from the domestic production activities deduction in the u.s. related to our authorization software.  the tax rate for the nine months ended september 30, 2012 was lower than the tax rate for the nine months ended september 30, 2011 due primarily to discrete benefits related to additional export incentives and the conclusion of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions.in 2010, in connection with the expansion of the company's operations in the asia pacific, middle east and africa region, the company's subsidiary in singapore, mastercard asia pacific pte. ltd. (“mappl”), received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance at the recommendation of the singapore economic development board.  the incentive had provided mappl with, among other benefits, a reduced income tax rate for the 10-year period commencing january 1, 2010 on taxable 32table of contentsincome in excess of a base amount.  the company continued to explore business opportunities in this region, resulting in an expansion of the incentives being granted by the ministry of finance, including a further reduction to the income tax rate on taxable income in excess of a revised fixed base amount commencing july 1, 2011 and continuing through december 31, 2025.  without the incentive grant, mappl would be subject to the statutory income tax rate on its earnings.liquidity and capital resourceswe need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures, to make continued investments in our business and to service our potential litigation obligations.  at september 30, 2012 and december 31, 2011, we had $5.6 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and current available-for-sale securities to use for our operations. in june 2012, the company's board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its class a common stock (the "new program").  the new program became effective in june 2012 at the completion of the company's previously announced $2 billion class a share repurchase program.  during the nine months ended september 30, 2012, mastercard repurchased a total of approximately 2.8 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion at an average price of $409.12 per share of class a common stock.  these repurchased shares are considered treasury stock.  the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, and economic and market conditions.  see note 7 (stockholders' equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report and note 15 (stockholders' equity) in part ii, item 8 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2011 for further discussion.  the company believes that its existing cash

consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2011), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings.  if these earnings are needed for u.s operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states, the company would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation.our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions and the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  see item 1a

entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.  under this guidance, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.  if, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity concludes that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired, then the entity would not be required to take further action.  however, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and compare the fair value with the carrying amount.  an entity also would have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value.  the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15, 2012 with early adoption permitted.  the company will adopt the revised accounting guidance effective october 1, 2012, and does not anticipate that this adoption will have an impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.fair value measurement and disclosure - the company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  the company classifies these recurring fair value measurements into a three-level hierarchy ("valuation hierarchy") and discloses the significant assumptions utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value.  in may 2011, the fair value accounting guidance was amended to change fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements.  the key changes in measurement principles include limiting the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise to nonfinancial assets, providing a framework for considering whether a premium or discount can be applied in a fair value measurement, and aligning the fair value measurement of instruments classified within an entity's shareholders' equity with the guidance for liabilities.  disclosures are required for all transfers between levels 1 and 2 within the valuation hierarchy, the use of a nonfinancial asset measured at fair value if its use differs from its highest and best use, the level in the valuation hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed, and for level 3 measurements, quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements.  the company adopted the revised accounting standard effective january 1, 2012 via prospective adoption, as required.  the adoption had no impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.comprehensive income - in june 2011, a new accounting standard was issued that amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income: (1) in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income.  also, items that are reclassified from other comprehensive 35table of contentsincome to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements.  in december 2011, a new accounting standard was issued that indefinitely deferred the effective date for the requirement to present the reclassification of items from comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements.  both standards require retrospective application, and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.  the company adopted the revised accounting standards effective january 1, 2012.  the adoption had no impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.36table of contents
