("hd supply"). this gain contributed $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2015.the results for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 included a $71 million net benefit to our provision for income taxes due primarily to the favorable settlement of a tax audit, resulting in a benefit of $0.05 to diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2015.13table of contentskey initiativesin the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, we continued to focus on the following key initiatives:customer experience – our customer experience initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates, and our commitment to customer service remains strong. we have taken a number of steps to enhance this initiative to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores, online, on the job site and in their homes. in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, we rolled out a complete redesign of our home depot website and mobile app, optimizing our desktop and tablet displays by enhancing content to display in full screen. the website redesign also included an expanded buy box, which makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred fulfillment option at checkout. also in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, we enhanced our dynamic eta feature for online purchases. dynamic eta provides a timelier and more accurately estimated delivery date, and we believe it will lead to increased conversion and customer satisfaction. product authority – our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. we also continued to leverage our merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools to better understand customer preferences and to refine our online and in-store product assortment in particular stores and geographic areas. productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain, disciplined capital allocation, and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. we continue to optimize our supply chain through our multi-year program called project sync, which is being rolled out gradually to suppliers in our u.s. rapid deployment centers ("rdcs"). this program will allow us to significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf, reduce transportation expenses and improve inventory turns. as we continue to roll out project sync, we plan to create an end-to-end solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain, from our suppliers to our transportation providers, our rdc and store associates, and to our customers.we opened one new store in mexico during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, for a total store count of 2,276 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016, a total of 299 of our stores, or 13.1%, were located in canada and mexico.we generated $7.9 billion of cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. this cash flow, along with $5.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, was used to repay $3.0 billion of 5.40% senior notes that matured on march 1, 2016, fund cash payments of $4.5 billion for share repurchases, pay $2.6 billion of dividends, fund $1.1 billion in capital expenditures and repay $350 million of short-term borrowings.our inventory turnover ratio was 5.0 times at the end of the third quarter of both fiscal 2016 and 2015. our return on invested capital (defined as net operating profit after tax, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current maturities, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period) was 29.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 26.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. for a reconciliation of net operating profit after tax to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure, and our calculation of return on invested capital, see "non-gaap financial measures" below.interconnecting retail – our focus on interconnecting retail is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, we continued to invest in our interconnected abilities to more effectively meet customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. we completed the deployment of our new customer order management platform ("com") in all of our u.s. stores in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. we also continued the roll out of our buy online, deliver from store ("bodfs") program, which complements our existing interconnecting retail programs, buy online, ship to store ("boss") and buy online, pick-up in store ("bopis"). we have seen strong demand for our bodfs program in areas where it has already been rolled out and expect to complete the roll out of bodfs by the end of fiscal 2016.additionally, we have fully implemented boss via rdc delivery capability, which enables us to fulfill boss orders through our rdc network, leveraging our inventory and fulfillment channels. this has resulted in significant cost savings and improved shipping times and customer satisfaction scores. in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, over 40% of our online orders were picked up in our stores through our bopis and boss offerings. sales from our online channels increased 17.5% and 19.2% for the 14table of contentsthird quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods last year, and represented 5.6% of our total net sales for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016.we believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the

quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 6.1% to $23.2 billion from $21.8 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, net sales increased 7.2% to $72.4 billion from $67.5 billion for the comparable period of fiscal 2015. the increase in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016 primarily reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, as well as sales from interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the increase in net sales was partially offset by pressure from foreign currency fluctuations, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $76 million and $453 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, respectively.total comparable store sales increased 5.5% for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, which reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength across our business, and an improved u.s. home improvement market. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016. comparable store sales for our appliances, lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, decor and flooring product categories were above the company average for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 2.4% and 2.8% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, respectively. our comparable store average ticket increased 3.1% and 2.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, respectively, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, flooring and roofing, offset in part by pressure from foreign currency fluctuations.gross profit increased 6.3% to $8.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $7.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. gross profit increased 7.1% to $24.8 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 from $23.1 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2015. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.7% for the third quarter of both fiscal 2016 and 2015, and 34.2% for the first nine months of both fiscal 2016 and 2015. gross profit margin for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of interline, which has a lower gross profit margin, offset by benefits from our supply chain driven by increased productivity and by a change in the mix of products sold.selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 2.9% to $4.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $4.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, and increased 2.6% to $12.9 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 from $12.6 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2015. sg&a for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016 included $23 million and $27 million, respectively, of pretax expenses related to the data breach. sg&a for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 included $20 million and $119 million, respectively, of pretax net expenses related to the data breach. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 18.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 19.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 17.9% compared to 18.7% for the same period last year. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls.depreciation and amortization increased 4.5% to $442 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $423 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. depreciation and amortization was $1.3 billion for the first nine months of both fiscal 2016 and 2015. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.9% for the third quarter of both fiscal 2016 and 2015, and was 1.8% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to 1.9% for the same period last year. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.operating income increased 11.4% to $3.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $3.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. operating income increased 13.8% to $10.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 from $9.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2015. operating income as a percent of net sales was 14.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 13.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. operating income as a percent of net sales was 14.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to 13.7% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015.for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized $236 million of interest and other, net, compared to $240 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. we recognized $701 million of interest and other, net, for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to $517 million for the same period last year. interest and other, net, for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 included a $144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 1.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to 0.8% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 due primarily to the anniversary of the pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 and higher long-term debt balances in the first nine months of fiscal 2016.16table of contentsour combined effective income tax rate was 36.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to 36.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015. the effective income tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 reflects a $71 million net benefit to our provision for income taxes due primarily to the favorable settlement of a tax audit.diluted earnings per share were $1.60 and $5.00 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, respectively, compared to $1.35 and $4.29 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively. expenses related to the data breach had a negative impact of $0.01 to diluted earnings per share for both the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2016, compared to negative impacts of $0.01 and $0.06 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015, respectively. the gain on the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2015. diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 also reflect $0.05 of benefit from the favorable settlement of a tax audit.non-gaap financial measuresto provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.return on invested capitalwe believe return on invested capital ("roic") is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. we define roic as net operating profit after tax ("nopat"), a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current maturities, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. the following table provides our roic calculation and reconciles nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure, for the twelve months ended october 30, 2016 and november 1, 2015

operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.9 billion compared to $7.4 billion for the same period in fiscal 2015. this increase was primarily due to a $675 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage, partially offset by a $277 million increase in merchandise inventories as a result of increased inventory purchases in support of increased sales.net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was $1.1 billion compared to $2.6 billion for the same period in fiscal 2015. this change was primarily due to $1.7 billion in payments for businesses acquired, net, in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 related to the acquisition of interline.net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was $5.4 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the same period of fiscal 2015. this change was primarily due to $2.0 billion less in net incremental long-term debt issued in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to the same period in fiscal 2015.in september 2016, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.125% senior notes due september 15, 2026 (the "september 2026 notes") at a discount of $11 million and $1.0 billion of 3.50% senior notes due september 15, 2056 (the "2056 notes") at a discount of $19 million (together, the "september 2016 issuance"). interest on the september 2026 and the 2056 notes is due semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning march 15, 2017. the net proceeds of the september 2016 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.in february 2016, we issued $1.35 billion of 2.00% senior notes due april 1, 2021 (the "2021 notes") at a discount of $5 million, $1.3 billion of 3.00% senior notes due april 1, 2026 (the "april 2026 notes") at a discount of $8 million, and $350 million of 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2046 (the "2046 notes") at a premium of $2 million (together, the "february 2016 issuance"). the 2046 notes form a single series with our $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2046 that were issued in may 2015, and have the same terms. the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due april 1, 2046 is $1.6 billion. interest on the 2021 and the april 2026 notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2016. interest on the 2046 notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning april 1, 2016, with interest accruing from october 1, 2015. the net proceeds of the february 2016 issuance were used to repay our 5.40% senior notes that matured on march 1, 2016.in fiscal 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion, accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the february 2016 issuance. in connection with the february 2016 issuance, we paid $89 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. this amount, net of income taxes, is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the april 2026 notes.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in december 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. at october 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. during the first nine months of fiscal 2016, all of our short-term borrowings were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was $617 million. as of october 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.as of october 30, 2016, we had $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.recent accounting pronouncementsfor a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements which may be applicable to us, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.on february 1, 2016, we adopted accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2015-03, "interest–imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs" and asu no. 2015-17, "income taxes (topic
