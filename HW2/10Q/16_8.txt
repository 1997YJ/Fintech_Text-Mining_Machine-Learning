loss of $725 million ($0.39 per share — diluted), compared with earnings of $2.57 billion ($1.37 per share — diluted) in the first three months of 2015.upstream incurred a loss of $1.46 billion in first quarter 2016 compared to earnings of $1.56 billion in the corresponding 2015 period. the decrease was mainly due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations, and the absence of a first quarter 2015 reduction in statutory tax rates in the united kingdom, along with unfavorable foreign currency effects.downstream earnings in first quarter 2016 were $735 million compared with $1.42 billion in the corresponding 2015 period. the decrease was due to lower margins on refined product sales, an asset impairment and unfavorable foreign currency effects.refer to pages 27 through 29 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for first quarter of 2016 versus the same period in 2015.business environment and outlookchevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, canada, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, nigeria, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, philippines, republic of congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, and venezuela.earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014, reflecting persistently high global crude oil inventories and production. the downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted, and, depending upon its duration, will continue to significantly impact the company's results of operations, cash flows, leverage, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. a sustained lower price environment could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets. the company is responding with reductions in operating expenses, including employee reductions, reductions in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2016 and future periods, and increased asset 24table of contentssales. the company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing of any such increase is unknown. in the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. refer to the "cautionary statement relevant to forward-looking information" on page 2 and to "risk factors" on pages 21 through 23 of the company’s 2015 annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. refer to the "results of operations" section, beginning on page 27 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2016. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. in recent years, chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. as a result of the decline in prices of crude oil and other commodities since mid-2014, these costs have declined. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.the chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $52 per barrel for the full-year 2015. during 2016, brent averaged $34 per barrel in the first quarter, and ended april at about $45. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. after falling sharply over second-half 2015 due to growing market over supply, prices hit multi-year lows of about $27 per barrel in january 2016 before firming 25table of contentsover the remainder of first quarter 2016 as oil and gas capital budgets were cut, non-opec supply growth plateaued, and opec discussed freezing production with major producers. first quarter 2016 brent-related crude prices in the atlantic basin also reflect refinery maintenance in north america, rising production and exports from iran, and rising geopolitical tensions in key regions. the wti price averaged $49 per barrel for the full-year 2015. during 2016, wti averaged $33 per barrel in the first quarter, and ended april at about $46. wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2015 and the first three months of 2016 as markets adapted to the lifting of the u.s. export ban and inventories remained near record levels in the u.s.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supply/demand balances for each crude type, which are functions of the capacity of refineries that are able to process each as feedstock into high-value light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). in first quarter 2016, the differential eased in north america as planned and unplanned outages restricted heavy crude supply from canada, while renewed imports and steady u.s. production dampened support for light sweet crude oil pricing. outside of north america, differentials widened as rising output from iran and other middle east producers pressured values of heavier, more sour crudes.chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 32 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $1.99 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the first three months of 2016, compared with $2.87 during the first three months of 2015. at the end of april 2016, the henry hub spot price was $1.91 per mcf. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. the company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (lng) are typically linked to crude oil prices. approximately 85 percent of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is targeted to be sold into binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market.  the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. international natural gas realizations averaged $3.91 per mcf during the first three months of 2016, compared with $5.01 per mcf in the same period last year. (see page 32 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)the company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2016 averaged 2.666 million barrels per day. about one-fourth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2016 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, indonesia, nigeria and venezuela. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for the first quarter of 2016 or 2015. at their december 2015 meeting, members of opec did not agree on a target production level effectively removing all limits on production. subsequently, in january 2016 nuclear-related sanctions on iran were lifted, and april discussions between opec and non-opec producers failed to reach agreement on a proposal to freeze production at january 2016 levels. as such, opec output is now considered likely to increase from recent levels of approximately 31.5 million barrels per day as iranian production and exports recover.the company estimates that net oil-equivalent production for the full-year 2016 will be flat to 4 percent growth compared to 2015. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including the duration of the low price environment that began in second-half 2014; quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the united states. 26table of contentsin the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. net oil-equivalent production in the partitioned zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. during 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. as of early 2016, production remains shut-in and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between saudi arabia and kuwait. the financial effects from the loss of production in 2015 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2016.refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 27 and 28 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. refer to the “results of operations” section on page 28 and 29 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.operating developmentsnoteworthy operating developments in recent months included the following:•angola — start-up is ongoing at the angola lng plant, with lng production and a cargo shipment expected in may. •australia — announced first lng production and first cargo shipment from train 1 at the gorgon project. •china — achieved first production from the chuandongbei project.results of operationsbusiness segments the following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments — upstream and downstream — as well as for “all other.” (refer to note 6, beginning on page 10, for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments,” as defined under the accounting standards for segment reporting.)upstream three months ended march 31 2016 2015 (millions of dollars)u.s. upstream earnings$(850) $(460)u.s. upstream operations incurred a loss of $850 million compared to a loss of $460 million from the corresponding period in 2015. the decrease was due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations of $460 million and $60 million, respectively, partially offset by lower operating expenses of $110 million.27table of contentsthe company’s average realization per barrel for u.s. crude oil and natural gas liquids in first quarter 2016 was $26, compared to $43 a year earlier. the average natural gas realization in first quarter 2016 was $1.32 per thousand cubic feet and $2.27 in 2015.net oil-equivalent production of 701,000 barrels per day in first quarter 2016 was up 2,000 barrels per day from the first quarter a year earlier. production increases due to project ramp-ups in the gulf of mexico, the marcellus shale in western pennsylvania, and the permian basin in texas and new mexico were mostly offset by maintenance-related downtime in the gulf of mexico, normal field declines and the effect of asset sales.the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 490,000 barrels per day in the first quarter was  essentially unchanged from the corresponding 2015 period. net natural gas production was 1.27 billion cubic feet per day in first quarter 2016, an increase of 1 percent from the comparative 2015 period. three months ended march 31 2016 2015 (millions of dollars)international upstream

billion from the corresponding period in 2015. the decrease was due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations of $1.16 billion and $240 million, the absence of a first quarter 2015 reduction in statutory tax rates in the united kingdom of $350 million, and lower gains on asset sales of $320 million. partially offsetting these effects were higher liftings of $220 million and lower exploration expenses of $90 million. foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $298 million in the 2016 quarter, compared with an increase of $522 million a year earlier.the average realization per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in first quarter 2016 was $29 compared with $46 a year earlier. the average natural gas realization per thousand cubic feet in first quarter 2016 was $3.91 compared

$8.9 billion at march 31, 2016, down $2.5 billion from year-end 2015. cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of 2016 was $1.1 billion, compared with $2.3 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting lower crude prices. cash capital and exploratory expenditures decreased $2.2 billion between periods, reflecting lower activity. dividends the company paid dividends of $2.0 billion to common shareholders during the first three months of 2016. in april 2016, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.07 per common share, payable in june 2016. debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $42.3 billion at march 31, 2016, up from $38.5 billion at december 31, 2015. the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the outstanding balance for the company's commercial paper program at march 31, 2016 was $12.1 billion. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $17.6 billion at march 31, 2016, and $12.9 billion at december 31, 2015. of these amounts, $8.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at both march 31, 2016, and december 31, 2015. at march 31, 2016, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at march 31, 2016, the company had $8.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. the credit facilities consist of a 364-day facility which enables borrowing of up to $6.0 billion and can be renewed for an additional 364-day period or the company can convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, and a $2.0 billion five-year facility expiring in december 2020. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at march 31, 2016. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in august 2018 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa- by standard and poor’s corporation. in april 2016, moody’s investors service changed its ratings for these securities from aa1 to aa2. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.common share repurchase program in july 2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. no shares were acquired under the program in 2015 or through the first three months of 2016, and the company does not plan to acquire any shares under the program for the remainder of the year. from the
