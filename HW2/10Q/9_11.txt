review of first quarter 2015 results 
 
exxonmobil’s first
quarter 2015 earnings of $4.9 billion, or $1.17 per diluted share, demonstrate
the value of the company’s integrated businesses in a lower commodity price
environment. regardless of current market conditions, the company remains
focused on business fundamentals and competitive advantages that create long‑term
shareholder value.

upstream earnings
were $2,855 million in the first three months of 2015, down $4,928 million
from the first quarter of 2014. lower liquids and gas realizations decreased
earnings by $5.5 billion. higher volumes and mix effects increased
earnings by $340 million, reflecting growth from new developments. all
other items, including favorable tax effects, increased earnings by
$250 million.
 
on an oil‑equivalent
basis, production increased 2.3 percent from the first quarter of 2014.
liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, up 129,000 barrels
per day, while natural gas production was 11.8 billion cubic feet per day,
down 188 million cubic feet per day from 2014. project ramp‑up and
entitlement effects were partly offset by field decline and maintenance
activities.
 
the u.s. upstream
operations recorded a loss of $52 million, down $1,296 million from
the first quarter of 2014. non-u.s. upstream earnings were $2,907 million,
down $3,632 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
 
cash provided by operating
activities totaled $8.0 billion for the first three months of 2015, $7.1
billion lower than 2014. the major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $5.1 billion, a decrease of $4.3 billion from the prior year
period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $4.3 billion for
depreciation and depletion increased by $0.1 billion. changes in operational
working capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2015, primarily due to
lower payables. changes in operational working capital added $2.5 billion to
cash flow in 2014, primarily due to higher payables. all other items net
decreased cash by $0.9 billion in both periods. for additional details, see the
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first three months of 2015 used net cash of $6.4 billion, an increase of
nearly $0.1 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to
property, plant and equipment of $6.8 billion was $0.5 billion lower than 2014.
proceeds from asset sales of $0.5 billion decreased $0.6 billion. additional
investment and advances decreased $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion. other investing
activities – net decreased $0.1 billion to $0.3 billion.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2015 was $8.5 billion,
including asset sales of $0.5 billion, and decreased $7.7 billion from the
comparable 2014 period primarily due to lower earnings and working capital
changes.
 
during the first
quarter of 2015, the corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt and used
part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used in financing
activities of $0.9 billion in the first three months of 2015 was $7.0 billion lower
than 2014 reflecting the 2015 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of exxonmobil stock in 2015.
  
during the first
quarter of 2015, exxon mobil corporation purchased 20 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1.8 billion. these purchases included
$1 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding with the balance used to
acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares
outstanding decreased from 4,201 million at year-end to 4,181 million at the
end of the first quarter 2015. purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.


17  



 

the corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $3.9
billion in the first quarter of 2015 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.2 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2015 compared to
$5.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2014.
 
total debt of $32.8
billion compared to $29.1 billion at year-end 2014. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 15.6 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2015
compared to 13.9 percent at year-end 2014.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s
common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

2014. income tax expense decreased by $4.3 billion to $1.6 billion reflecting
lower pre-tax income and a lower effective tax rate. the effective income tax
rate was 33 percent compared to 45 percent in the
prior year period due primarily to a lower share of earnings in higher
tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other
taxes and duties decreased by $3.5 billion to $12.8 billion as a result of
lower sales realizations.

anticipates an average investment profile of about $34 billion per year for the
next few years. actual spending could vary depending on the progress of
individual projects and property acquisitions.
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2017. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "factors
affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our website and in
item 1a of exxonmobil's 2014 form 10-k. we assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
 
cash provided by operating
activities totaled $8.0 billion for the first three months of 2015, $7.1
billion lower than 2014. the major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $5.1 billion, a decrease of $4.3 billion from the prior year
period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $4.3 billion for
depreciation and depletion increased by $0.1 billion. changes in operational
working capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2015, primarily due to
lower payables. changes in operational working capital added $2.5 billion to
cash flow in 2014, primarily due to higher payables. all other items net
decreased cash by $0.9 billion in both periods. for additional details, see the
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first three months of 2015 used net cash of $6.4 billion, an increase of
nearly $0.1 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to
property, plant and equipment of $6.8 billion was $0.5 billion lower than 2014.
proceeds from asset sales of $0.5 billion decreased $0.6 billion. additional
investment and advances decreased $0.2 billion to $0.3 billion. other investing
activities – net decreased $0.1 billion to $0.3 billion.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2015 was $8.5 billion,
including asset sales of $0.5 billion, and decreased $7.7 billion from the
comparable 2014 period primarily due to lower earnings and working capital
changes.
 
during the first
quarter of 2015, the corporation issued $8.0 billion of long-term debt and used
part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used in financing
activities of $0.9 billion in the first three months of 2015 was $7.0 billion lower
than 2014 reflecting the 2015 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of exxonmobil stock in 2015.
  
during the first
quarter of 2015, exxon mobil corporation purchased 20 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $1.8 billion. these purchases included
$1 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding with the balance used to
acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares
outstanding decreased from 4,201 million at year-end to 4,181 million at the
end of the first quarter 2015. purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.


17  



 

the corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $3.9
billion in the first quarter of 2015 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.2 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2015 compared to
$5.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2014.
 
total debt of $32.8
billion compared to $29.1 billion at year-end 2014. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 15.6 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2015
compared to 13.9 percent at year-end 2014.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s
common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income, sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled
$14.4 billion for the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of $7.8 billion from
2014. income tax expense decreased by $4.3 billion to $1.6 billion reflecting
lower pre-tax income and a lower effective tax rate. the effective income tax
rate was 33 percent compared to 45 percent in the
prior year period due primarily to a lower share of earnings in higher
tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other
taxes and duties decreased by $3.5 billion to $12.8 billion as a result of
lower sales realizations.

capital
and exploration expenditures in the first quarter of 2015 were $7.7 billion, down
9 percent from the first quarter of 2014, in line with plan. the corporation
anticipates an average investment profile of about $34 billion per year for the
next few years. actual spending could vary depending on the progress of
individual projects and property acquisitions.
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2017. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "factors
affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our website and in
item 1a of exxonmobil's 2014 form 10-k. we assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.
