billion from $22.5 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first six months of fiscal 2014, net sales increased 4.4% to $43.5 billion from $41.6 billion for the comparable period of fiscal 2013. the increase in net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by customer transactions and average ticket growth. total comparable store sales increased 5.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 on top of an increase of 10.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first six months of fiscal 2014, total comparable stores sales increased 4.3% on top of an increase of 7.7% for the same period of fiscal 2013.   the positive comparable store sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our maintenance and repair categories, and an improved u.s. and canadian home improvement market. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014.  comparable store sales for our tools, millwork, outdoor garden, electrical, kitchen and bath product categories were above or at the company average for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 4.1% and 3.2% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014, respectively, and our comparable store average ticket increased 1.7% and 1.1% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014, respectively, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases, such as appliances, windows, water heaters and wood and laminate flooring. gross profit increased 5.7% to $8.2 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 from $7.7 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. gross profit increased 4.5% to $15.0 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2014 from $14.4 billion for the first six months for fiscal 2013. gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.3% for the second quarter of both fiscal 2014 and  2013. for the first six months of both fiscal 2014 and 2013, gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.6%. gross profit margin for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014 reflects higher levels of co-op allowances and rebates and benefits from sales mix changes, offset by higher shrink and deleverage within our supply chain due to higher transportation costs. selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") were $4.3 billion for the second quarter of both fiscal 2014 and 2013, and were $8.5 billion for the first six months of both fiscal 2014 and 2013. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 18.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 19.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first six months of fiscal 2014, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 19.5% compared to 20.4% for the same period last year. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, strong expense controls, and lower management bonuses and workers' compensation expenses than last year. depreciation and amortization increased 1.5% to $415 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 from $409 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first six months of fiscal 2014, depreciation and amortization increased 2.2% to $829 million from $811 million for the same period of fiscal 2013. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 1.8% for the second quarter of 2013, and was 1.9% for the first six months of both fiscal 2014 and 2013. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment, offset by higher depreciation related to capital expenditures that in recent years have been more heavily weighted toward technology assets, which have shorter depreciable lives.operating income increased 14.2% to $3.4 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 from $3.0 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. operating income increased 12.0% to $5.7 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2014 from $5.1 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2013. for the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recognized $191 million of interest and other, net, compared to $172 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. we recognized $282 million of interest and other, net, for the first six months of fiscal 2014 compared to $333 million for the same period last year. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.8% for the second quarter of both fiscal 2014 and 2013. for the first six months of fiscal 2014, interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.6% compared to 0.8% for the same period last year. these results reflect additional interest expense incurred in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014 on the long-term debt issued in september 2013 and june 2014. this was offset by a $112 million pretax gain in the first six months of fiscal 2014 related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in hd supply.  our combined effective income tax rate was 37.0% for the first six months of fiscal 2014 compared to 36.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2013. 14table of contentsdiluted earnings per share were $1.52 and $2.51 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014, respectively, compared to $1.24 and $2.07 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013, respectively. diluted earnings per share for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2014 reflect $0.01 and $0.05, respectively, of benefit related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in hd supply. liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. during the first six months of fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.3 billion compared to $4.7 billion for the same period in fiscal 2013. this increase was primarily due to a $408 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls and cash generated through working capital efficiency. net cash used in investing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2014 was $503 million compared to $596 million for the same period in fiscal 2013. this change was primarily due to $112 million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in hd supply and a $13 million decrease in payments for business acquired partially offset by a $32 million increase in capital expenditures in the first six months of fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.net cash used in financing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2014 was $2.5 billion compared to $3.2 billion for the same period of fiscal 2013. this change was primarily the result of $846 million less in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $142 million more in cash dividends paid to stockholders in the first six months of fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.in june 2014, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.00% senior notes due june 15, 2019 (the "2019 notes") at a discount of $4 million and $1.0 billion of 4.40% senior notes due march 15, 2045 (the "2045 notes") at a discount of $15 million (together, the "june 2014 issuance"). interest on the 2019 notes is due semi-annually on june 15 and december 15 of each year, beginning december 15, 2014. interest on the 2045 notes is due semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning september 15, 2014. the net proceeds of the june 2014 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $950 million of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $950 million to the financial institution and received a total of 12.1 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $950 million asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement. in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.75 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.75 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of 16.9 million shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.75 billion asr agreement will be determined in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement. in the first six months of fiscal 2014, we also repurchased 9.9 million additional shares of our common stock for $800 million in the open market.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in july 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. at august 3, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. as of august 3, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.as of august 3, 2014, we had $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.15table of contentsrecent accounting pronouncementsin may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, "revenue from
