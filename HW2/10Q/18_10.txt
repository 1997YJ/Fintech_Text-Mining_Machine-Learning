the valuation of our financial instruments.•contractual obligations. material changes, outside our ordinary course of business, to our significant contractual obligations as of december 27, 2014.this interim md&a should be read in conjunction with the md&a in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 27, 2014 and form 8-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on june 5, 2015. the various sections of this md&a contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "goals," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "may," "will," "should," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of our annual report on form 10-k, and as may be updated in our subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q. our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations, including our definitive agreement with altera corporation as discussed in “note 7: acquisitions” in the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q, that had not been completed as of

revenue of $13.2 billion was down 5% from q2 2014, and in line with our business outlook as provided in april 2015. the decrease from q2 2014 was driven by lower client computing group (ccg) unit sales, primarily desktop and notebook platforms, partially offset by higher data center group (dcg) platform revenue and non-volatile memory solutions group revenue. our ccg operating segment continues to be challenged by macroeconomic conditions driving lower demand in the business segment and emerging markets. in the worldwide pc supply chain, we saw a slight decline of inventory levels in q2 and believe that overall inventory levels are normal. our own inventory declined in units but grew in dollars, as we refreshed inventory levels with 14-nanometer (nm) products. our business portfolio is continuing to transform, as we continue to see growth in our dcg, our internet of things group (iotg), and our non-volatile memory solutions group, which together accounted for almost 40% of our net revenue and more than 70% of our operating profit in q2 2015.gross margin decreased by 2% points from q2 2014 and exceeded our previous business outlook of 0.5%. the decrease from q2 2014 was primarily due to higher platform unit costs and lower platform unit sales. these decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices. as compared to q2 2014, operating income of $2.9 billion was down 25%, net income of $2.7 billion was down 3%, and earnings per share of $0.55 was flat. our tax rate for the quarter was 9.3%, a 19.4 point reduction from q2 2014 driven by a one-time refund claim and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years' non-u.s. earnings.in q2 2015, we have qualified for sale our 6th generation intel® core™ processor family, formally code-named "skylake," for production and we continue to see excitement in the industry for the launch of our 6th generation intel core processor family and microsoft windows* 10. we continue to develop 10nm process technology, our next-generation process technology. our plan is to introduce a new intel core microarchitecture approximately every two and half years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening periods. in the second half of 2016, we plan to introduce a third 14nm product code-named "kaby lake," built on the foundations of the 6th generation intel core processor family microarchitecture along with key performance enhancements. in the second half of 2017, we expect to launch our first 10nm product, code-named "cannon lake." we expect that this addition to the roadmap will deliver new features and improved performance, and pave the way for a smooth transition to 10nm process technology. our business continues to generate significant cash with $3.4 billion of cash from operations in q2 2015. during q2 2015, we purchased $1.8 billion in capital assets and returned cash to shareholders by both paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $697 million of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. we ended q2 2015 with $13.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets; flat compared to q1 2015. additionally, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in july 2015 of $0.24 per share of common stock to be paid in september 2015.during q2 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera corporation. as of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion. this transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including the approval of altera's stockholders. for further information, see "note 7: acquisitions" in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.37intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)for q3 2015, we are forecasting a revenue midpoint of $14.3 billion, up 8% from q2 2015. this forecast is at the higher end range of the average seasonal increase for the third quarter. we are forecasting q3 2015 gross margin midpoint of 63%, half a point increase from q2 2015. we are now expecting 2015 full year revenue to be down approximately one percent from 2014. while we are expecting seasonal market growth for the remaining portion of 2015, our expectations are that the pc market is going to be weaker than previously expected. we continue to forecast robust growth rates in dcg, iotg, and non-volatile memory solutions group which will mostly offset the decline in ccg. additionally, we are forecasting spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general, and administrative (mg&a)) to be approximately $19.8 billion plus or minus $400 million, up $100 million from the prior business outlook for full year 2015. we are now forecasting the midpoint of our capital spending for full year 2015 to be $7.7 billion, down $1.0 billion from our previous business outlook and our lowest capital spending in five years. this change is primarily driven by manufacturing efficiencies and our new strategy on our next-generation process technology.our business outlook for q3 2015 and full-year 2015 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (r&d plus mg&a), and capital expenditures. we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release. our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10-q. the statements in the business outlook and forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and at other times. the forward-looking statements in the business outlook and reiterated or updated in this form 10-q will be effective through the close of business on september 11, 2015 unless updated earlier or except as specifically noted otherwise in the business outlook. from the close of business on september 11, 2015 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for october 13, 2015, we will observe a “quiet period.”during the quiet period, the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on july 15, 2015, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the sec, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be considered historical, speaking prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.38intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)results of

data center group, and the internet of things group (platform).our net revenue for q2 2015 decreased by $636 million compared to q2 2014. total platform unit sales decreased by 8%, driven by the challenging macroeconomic conditions and higher pc demand due to microsoft windows* xp refresh in the comparable period. this decrease was partially offset by higher platform average selling prices of 3%. the higher average selling price was driven by a higher proportion of dcg platform unit sales, higher desktop average selling prices, and partially offset by a higher proportion of tablet and phone unit sales (which have a lower average selling price). the decrease in revenue was also partially offset by higher non-volatile memory solutions group revenue.our overall gross margin dollars for q2 2015 decreased by $669 million, or 8%, compared to q2 2014. this decrease was due to lower platform revenue, primarily in the ccg operating segment, and $215 million of higher platform unit costs on a higher proportion of 14nm products.our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 62.5% in q2 2015 from 64.5% in q2 2014. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin decrease in the ccg operating segment. we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q2 2015 and q2 2014 from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments.client computing groupthe revenue and operating income for the ccg operating segment for each period were as follows:(in millions) q2 2015 q2 2014platform revenue $7,124 $8,323other

revenue was primarily driven by $874 million of lower desktop platform unit sales, which were down 22%, and $529 million of lower notebook platform unit sales, which were down 11%. these decreases were partially offset by $182 million higher desktop average selling prices, which were up 6%.operating income decreased by $984 million, or 38%, in q2 2015 compared to q2 2014, which was driven by $1.1 billion of lower gross margin, partially offset by $83 million of lower operating expenses. gross margin decreased by approximately $945 million due to lower ccg platform revenue, primarily driven by the decrease in desktop and notebook platform unit sales. to a lesser extent, approximately $290 million of higher ccg platform unit costs also contributed to the decrease in gross

2015 related to this program impacted approximately 3,500 employees.we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges incurred to date as part of the 2015 restructuring program will result in gross annual savings of approximately $300 million, which will be realized within r&d, mg&a and cost of sales. we began to realize these savings in q2 2015 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in q3 2015.2013 restructuring programbeginning in q3 2013, management approved and commenced implementation of several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. these actions include the wind down of our 200 millimeter wafer fabrication facility in massachusetts, which ceased production in q1 2015, and the closure of our assembly and test facility in costa rica, which ceased production in q4 2014. these targeted reductions will enable us to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the current business environment. we expect these actions to be substantially complete by the end of 2015.restructuring and asset impairment charges for the 2013 restructuring program for each period were

recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. restructuring actions related to this program that were approved in 2015 impacted approximately 1,300 employees. since q3 2013, we have incurred a total of $638 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. these charges included a total of $562 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 8,900 employees, and $76 million in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges.we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges incurred to date as part of the 2013 restructuring program will result in gross annual savings of approximately $600 million, which will be realized within r&d, mg&a and

settlement of a one-time refund claim involving asset tax basis resulting in the recognition of a $320 million tax benefit and our decision during 2015 to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years' non-u.s. earnings resulting in the release of $185 million previously accrued u.s. deferred taxes.46intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.for the first six months of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014, the $1.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operations was due to changes in working capital and adjustments to net income for non-cash items. the adjustments to net income were lower due to deferred taxes, partially offset by higher depreciation.changes in assets and liabilities as of june 27, 2015, compared to december 27, 2014, included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits due to the payout of 2014 profit-dependent compensation and an increase in inventories due to the ramp of our 5th generation intel core processor family of products, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable resulting from a lower portion of sales at the end of q2 2015.for the first six months of 2015, our three largest customers accounted for 44% of net revenue (44% for the first six months of 2014) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 18% of our net revenue (17% for the first six months of 2014), dell inc. accounting for 15% of our net revenue (16% for the first six months of 2014), and lenovo group limited accounting for 11% of our net revenue (11% for the first six months of 2014). these three customers accounted for 40% of net accounts receivable as of june 27, 2015 (43% as of december 27, 2014).investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.cash used for investing activities was lower for the first six months of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014. cash used for investing activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets, an increase in maturities and sales of trading assets, and a decrease in capital expenditures. this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in maturities of available-for-sale investments.financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.47intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)the decrease in cash used for financing activities for the first six months of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of june 27, 2015, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $13.9 billion ($14.1 billion as of december 27, 2014). in addition to the $13.9 billion, we have $1.7 billion of other long-term investments, $1.2 billion of loans receivable and other, and $450 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months, that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. a substantial majority of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3.another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion, which our board of directors increased from $3.0 billion during q2 2015. this ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $900 million during the first six months of 2015 and no commercial paper remained outstanding as of june 27, 2015. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of june 27, 2015. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.as of june 27, 2015, $11.2 billion of our $13.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $11.2 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $1.9 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of june 27, 2015. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.during q2 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera corporation (altera) in an all-cash transaction expected to close within six to nine months from the date of the agreement. as of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion. we intend to finance the acquisition through a combination of $7.0 billion to $9.0 billion in long-term debt and the remainder with commercial paper and cash and investments.we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 3: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of june 27, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $14.4 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $5.1 billion was classified as level 1, $9.3 billion as level 2, and $76 million as level 3.48intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $9.3 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 54% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 46% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of june 27, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $492 million of loans receivable and $318 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of june 27, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $7.2 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.49intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)contractual obligationspending acquisition of altera corporationduring q2 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera corporation (altera) in an all-cash transaction expected to close within six to nine months from the date of the agreement. the acquisition will couple intel’s leading-edge products and manufacturing process with altera’s leading field-programmable gate array technology. the combination is expected to enable new classes of products that meet customer needs in the data center and internet of things market segments. upon completion of the acquisition, each outstanding share of altera common stock and, subject to certain exceptions, each share of altera common stock underlying vested stock option awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance-based restricted stock unit awards will be converted into the right to receive $54.00 per share in cash, without interest. as of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion. this transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, including the approval of altera's stockholders. we intend to finance the acquisition of altera through a combination of $7.0 billion to $9.0 billion in long-term debt and the remainder with commercial paper and cash and investments. the timing, amount and terms of any additional long-term debt financing are subject to market and other conditions.investment in tsinghua unigroup ltd.during 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with tsinghua unigroup ltd. (tsinghua unigroup), an operating subsidiary of tsinghua holdings co. ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop intel® architecture- and communications-based solutions for smartphones. we have also agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of a holding company under tsinghua unigroup. subsequent to the end of the q2 2015 and prior to the filing of this form 10-q, we invested approximately $1.0 billion to complete the first phase of the equity investment. subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, the second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately $500 million. this phase of the investment will allow us to maintain a 20% equity ownership. 50
