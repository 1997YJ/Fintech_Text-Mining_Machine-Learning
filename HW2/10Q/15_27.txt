item 2. management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations (md&a)

introduction

our
md&a is provided in addition to the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements and footnotes to assist readers in understanding pfizer’s
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the md&a is
organized as follows:





●  


overview of our performance
      and operating environment. this section, beginning on page 28,
      provides information about the following: our business; our performance
      during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009; our operating
      environment; our strategic initiatives; and our cost-reduction
      initiatives.








●  


revenues. this section,
      beginning on page 34, provides an analysis of our products and revenues
      for the three- and nine- month periods ended september 27, 2009 and
      september 28, 2008, as well as an overview of important product
      developments.








●  


costs and expenses.
      this section, beginning on page 43, provides a discussion about our costs
      and expenses.








●  


provision for taxes on
      income. this section, on page 46, provides a discussion of items
      impacting our tax provision for the periods
  presented.








●  


adjusted income. this
      section, beginning on page 46, provides a discussion of an alternative
      view of performance used by
management.








●  


financial condition, liquidity
      and capital resources. this section, beginning on page 50, provides
      an analysis of our balance sheets as of september 27, 2009 and december
      31, 2008 and cash flows for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, as
      well as a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments that existed
      as of september 27, 2009, and december 31, 2008. included in the
      discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial
      capacity available to help fund our future
  activities.








●  


outlook. this section,
      beginning on page 54, provides a discussion of our expectations for
      full-year 2009, among other things.








●  


forward-looking information
      and factors that may affect future results. this section, beginning
      on page 55, provides a description of the risks and uncertainties that
      could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in
      forward-looking
      statements set forth in this md&a relating to our financial results,
      operations and business plans and prospects. such forward-looking
      statements are based on management’s current expectations about future
      events, which are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in
      circumstances. also included in this section is a discussion of legal
      proceedings and contingencies.

overview of our performance
and operating environment

our
business

we are a
global, research-based company applying innovative science to improve world
health. our efforts in support of that purpose include the discovery,
development, manufacture and marketing of safe and effective medicines; the
exploration of ideas that advance the frontiers of science and medicine; and the
support of programs dedicated to illness prevention, health and wellness, and
increased access to quality healthcare. our value proposition is to demonstrate
that our medicines can effectively prevent and treat disease, including the
associated symptoms and suffering, and can form the basis for an overall
improvement in healthcare systems and their related costs. our revenues are
derived from the sale of our products, as well as through alliance agreements,
under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies.

on
october 15, 2009, we completed our acquisition of wyeth in a cash-and-stock
transaction valued, based on the closing market price of pfizer’s common stock
on that date, at $50.40 per share of wyeth common stock, or a total of
approximately $68 billion. we have taken certain actions and incurred certain
costs associated with the transaction prior to the acquisition closing date that
are reflected in our financial statements. however, the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from wyeth, the consideration paid to acquire wyeth, as well
as the results of wyeth’s operations, are not reflected in our condensed
consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine month periods
ended september 27, 2009. for additional information see the “our strategic
initiatives – strategy and recent transactions” and “costs and expenses –
acquisition-related costs” sections of this md&a.

our 2009
performance

revenues in the third quarter
of 2009 decreased 3% to $11.6 billion compared to the same period in 2008.
revenues in the first nine months of 2009 decreased 7% to $33.5 billion compared
to the same period in 2008. the significant human pharmaceutical product,
alliance revenue and animal health impacts on revenues for the third quarter and
first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, are as
follows:

(a)


lipitor
      was unfavorably impacted primarily by foreign exchange, as well as
      competitive pressures and other
factors.







(b)


zyrtec/zyrtec
      d lost u.s. exclusivity in late january 2008, at which time we ceased
      selling this product. camptosar lost u.s. exclusivity in february 2008 and
      in europe in july 2009. norvasc lost exclusivity in japan in july
      2008.







(c)


chantix/champix
      has been negatively impacted by changes to its label in 2008 and
      additional label changes in july 2009 (see “revenues – pharmaceutical –
      selected product descriptions” section of this
  md&a).




foreign
exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $610 million, or 5%, in
the third quarter of 2009 and approximately $2.3 billion, or 6%, during the
first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008. revenues in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the year-ago periods
were favorably impacted by a $217 million adjustment in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2008 related to prior years’ liabilities for product
returns.

in the
u.s., revenues decreased 2% in the third quarter of 2009 and 6% in the first
nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, reflecting, in part,
continued generic competition, loss of exclusivity for certain products and
increasing managed care pricing pressures and formulary restrictions.
international revenues decreased 4% in the third quarter of 2009 and 8% in the
first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, reflecting the
negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by operational growth in
these markets.
 






28










 

the
impact of rebates in the third quarter of 2009 decreased revenues by
approximately $898 million, compared to approximately $825 million in the
prior-year third quarter. the impact of rebates in the first nine months of 2009
decreased revenues by approximately $2.8 billion, compared to approximately $2.5
billion for the first nine months of 2008. the increase in rebates in each of
the periods was due primarily to the impact of our contracting strategies with
both government and non-government entities in the u.s.

for
further discussion of our pharmaceutical products and revenues, see the
“revenues – pharmaceutical business revenues” section of this
md&a.

income from continuing operations
for the third quarter of 2009 was $2.9 billion, compared to $2.3 billion
in the third quarter of 2008, and $7.9 billion in the first nine months of 2009,
compared to $7.8 billion in the first nine months of 2008.

the
increases were primarily due to:





●  


the
      after-tax charge of $640 million resulting from agreements to resolve
      certain litigation involving the company’s non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory (nsaid) pain medicines in the year-ago
      quarter;










●  


lower
      costs associated with implementing our pfizer cost reduction
      initiatives;








●  


savings
      related to our pfizer cost-reduction initiatives;
  and








●  


lower
      acquisition-related in-process research and development charges of $20
      million in the first nine months of 2009 compared to $567 million in the
      first nine months of 2008;




partially
offset by:





●  


the
      decrease in revenues reflecting, in particular, the unfavorable impact of
      foreign exchange;








●  


the
      increase in the effective tax rate, net of a $174 million favorable income
      tax adjustment in the third quarter of 2009, attributable mainly to
      increased tax costs associated with certain business decisions executed to
      finance the acquisition of wyeth as well as the non-recurrence of
      favorable income tax adjustments that were recorded during the first nine
      months of 2008;








●  


higher
      interest expense, mainly due to the issuance of approximately $24 billion
      in senior unsecured notes in the first half of 2009 to partially finance
      the acquisition of wyeth, as well as lower interest income;
      and

costs
      incurred in connection with the wyeth
  acquisition.




we have
made significant progress with our pfizer cost-reduction initiatives, launched
in early 2005, which are broad-based, company-wide efforts to improve
performance and efficiency (see further discussion in the “our cost-reduction
initiatives” section of this md&a).

during
the first nine months of 2009, we expensed acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (ipr&d) of $20 million related to a
2008 acquisition (see further discussion in the “our strategic initiatives –
strategy and recent transactions: acquisitions, licensing and collaborations”
section of this md&a). as a result of adopting the provisions of a new
accounting standard issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb)
related to business combinations, beginning january 1, 2009, ipr&d related
to acquisitions after adoption will be recorded on our consolidated balance
sheet as indefinite-lived intangible assets. no acquisitions were consummated in
the first nine months of 2009.

our operating
environment

general
economic conditions

while the
global recession has affected our business, the impact so far has been
consistent with the expectations reflected in our financial guidance for 2009
(see the “outlook” section of this md&a). the impact on our human
pharmaceutical business has been largely in the u.s. market, affecting products
such as lipitor, celebrex and lyrica. health insurers and benefit plans continue
to impose formulary restrictions in favor of generics. we believe that patients,
experiencing the effects of the weak economy and facing increases in co-pays,
are sometimes switching to generics, delaying treatments or skipping doses to
reduce their costs. the recession has also increased the number of patients in
the medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to
substantial rebates and, in many states, to formulary restrictions limiting
access to brand-name drugs. our animal health business also has been impacted by
the recession, which has adversely affected global spending on veterinary
care.

despite
the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position.
we have a strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity that provides us with
financial flexibility. our long-term debt is rated high quality and investment
grade by both standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service. as market
conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken
and will continue to take a conservative approach to our investments. both
short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly
liquid, investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. as a result, we
continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the
foreseeable future (see further discussion in the “financial condition,
liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a).

industry-specific
challenges

in
addition to general economic conditions, we and other pharmaceutical companies
continue to face significant industry-specific challenges in a profoundly
changing business environment, as explained more fully in pfizer’s annual report
on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2008. industry-wide factors,
including pharmaceutical product pricing and access, intellectual property
rights, product competition, the regulatory environment, pipeline productivity
and the changing business environment, can significantly impact our operations.
in order to meet these challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the
marketplace, we have taken, and continue to take steps to change the way we
operate our pharmaceutical and other operations.

effective
january 1, 2009, we changed our operating model within the pharmaceutical
segment, which during the first nine months of 2009 was comprised of five
customer-focused units—primary care, specialty care, oncology, established
products and emerging markets—with clear, single points of accountability to
enable the segment to more effectively anticipate and respond to the diverse
needs of physicians, customers and patients. as in the past, the pharmaceutical
segment continues to be managed inclusive of our research and manufacturing
organizations and supported by administrative functions.

generic
competition and patent expirations significantly impact our business. we lost
exclusivity for camptosar in the u.s. in february 2008 and in europe in july
2009 and for norvasc in the u.s. in march 2007 and in japan in july 2008. as
expected, significant revenue declines followed. zyrtec/zyrtec d lost its u.s.
exclusivity in late january 2008, at which time we ceased selling this product.
lipitor began to face competition in the u.s. in 2006 from generic pravastatin
(pravachol) and generic simvastatin (zocor), in addition to other competitive
pressures. the volume of patients who start on or switch to generic simvastatin
continues to negatively impact lipitor prescribing trends, particularly in the
managed-care environment. generic competition is also adversely impacting
revenues in the u.s. for certain other products, including celebrex and
lyrica.

we will
continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasing incidents
of infringement whenever appropriate. for more detailed information about our
significant products, see discussion in the “revenues – pharmaceutical –
selected product descriptions” section of this md&a. also, see part ii –
other information; item
1. legal proceedings,
of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect
to patent litigation.

u.s.
policy issues

healthcare
reform in the u.s., if enacted, could have a significant impact on our business.
although we cannot predict the outcome of pending and possible future u.s.
healthcare reform initiatives, we remain committed and actively engaged in
discussions to reform healthcare in a way that expands coverage for those
currently uninsured, does not erode coverage for those currently insured,
improves quality, rewards innovation and provides value for patients. during the
second quarter of 2009, the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america
(phrma), of which we are a member, announced an $80 billion commitment over the
next decade to support healthcare reform in the u.s. among other things, that
commitment includes reducing the cost of medicines for seniors and disabled
americans who are affected by the coverage gap in the medicare prescription drug
program. the phrma commitment is intended to be part of any federal healthcare
reform legislation in the u.s.

comprehensive
tax reform in the u.s., if enacted, also could have a significant impact on our
business. although we cannot predict the outcome of pending and possible future
u.s. tax reform proposals, we remain engaged in discussions with policymakers.
specifically, if legislation were enacted that ends the deferral of u.s.
taxation of income earned overseas by u.s. companies, it may adversely impact
our ability to compete against other companies in our industry, many of which
are not based in the u.s.

these and
other factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with
information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may
affect future results” section of this md&a.

our strategic initiatives –
strategy and recent transactions

acquisitions,
licensing and collaborations

we are
committed to capitalizing on new growth opportunities by advancing our
new-product pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well
as through opportunistic licensing, co-promotion agreements and acquisitions.
our business-development strategy targets a number of growth opportunities,
including biologics, vaccines, oncology, diabetes, alzheimer’s disease,
inflammation/immunology, pain, psychoses (schizophrenia) and other products and
services that seek to provide valuable healthcare solutions. some of our more
significant business-development transactions during the first nine months of
2009 and 2008 are described below:





●  


in
      the first quarter of 2009, we entered into a five-year agreement with
      bausch & lomb to co-promote prescription pharmaceuticals in the u.s.
      for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. the agreement covers
      prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, including our xalatan product and
      bausch & lomb’s alrex®, lotemax® and zylet® products, as well as
      bausch & lomb’s investigational anti-infective eye drop, besifloxacin
      ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%, which is currently under review by the u.s.
      food and drug administration (fda).








●  


in
      the second quarter of 2008, we acquired encysive pharmaceuticals inc.
      (encysive), a biopharmaceutical company whose main asset is thelin, which
      is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. the cost of
      acquiring encysive, through a tender offer and subsequent merger, was
      approximately $200 million, including transaction costs. upon our
      acquisition of encysive, encysive's change of control repurchase
      obligations under its outstanding $130 million 2.5% convertible notes were
      triggered and, as a result, encysive repurchased the convertible notes in
      consideration for their par value plus accrued interest in june 2008. in
      addition, in the second quarter of 2008, we acquired serenex, inc.
      (serenex), a privately held biotechnology company, whose main asset is
      snx-5422, an oral heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) for the potential
      treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies and an extensive
      hsp90 inhibitor compound library, which has potential uses in treating
      cancer, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. in connection with
      these acquisitions, through third-quarter 2008, we recorded approximately
      $170 million in acquisition-related in-process
      research and development charges and approximately $450 million in
      intangible assets.








●  


in
      the first quarter of 2008, we acquired covx, a privately held
      biotherapeutics company specializing in preclinical oncology and metabolic
      research and the developer of a biotherapeutics technology platform. also
      in the first quarter of 2008, we acquired all the outstanding shares of
      coley pharmaceutical group, inc. (coley), a biopharmaceutical company
      specializing in vaccines and drug candidates designed to fight cancers,
      allergy and asthma disorders, and autoimmune diseases, for approximately
      $230 million. in connection with these and two smaller acquisitions
      related to animal health, we recorded approximately $398 million in acquisition-related in-process
      research and development charges in the first nine months of 2008.
      in the first nine months of 2009, we resolved a contingency associated
      with covx and recorded $20 million in acquisition-related in-process
      research and development
charges.




the
following transactions were not completed as of the end of the third quarter of
2009, and our consolidated financial statements as of september 27, 2009 do not
assume their completion. however, we have incurred certain costs related to the
acquisition of wyeth that are reflected in our financial
statements:





●  


on
      october 15, 2009 (the acquisition date), we acquired all of the
      outstanding equity of wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction, valued at
      approximately $68 billion, in which each share of wyeth common stock
      outstanding, with certain limited exceptions, was cancelled and converted
      into the right to receive $33.00 in cash without interest and 0.985 of a
      share of pfizer common stock. the stock component was valued at $17.40 per
      share of wyeth common stock based on the closing market price of pfizer’s
      common stock on the acquisition date, resulting in a total merger
      consideration value of $50.40 per share of wyeth common stock. while wyeth
      is now a wholly owned subsidiary of pfizer, the merger of local pfizer and
      wyeth entities may be pending or delayed in various jurisdictions and
      integration in these jurisdictions is subject to completion of various
      local legal and regulatory obligations. we have taken certain actions and
      incurred certain costs associated with the transaction prior to the
      acquisition date that are reflected in our financial statements. however,
      the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from wyeth, the consideration
      paid to acquire wyeth, as well as the results of wyeth’s operations, are
      not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and
      for the three and nine month periods ended september 27,
    2009.



 


wyeth’s
core business was the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of
prescription pharmaceutical products for humans. other operations of wyeth
included consumer health care products (over-the-counter products), vaccines,
nutritionals and animal health products. with the acquisition of wyeth, we are
now a more diversified health care company, with product offerings in human,
animal, and consumer health, including vaccines, biologics, small molecules and
nutrition across developed and emerging markets.  the acquisition of
wyeth also strengthens our pipeline of biopharmaceutical development projects to
help patients in critical areas, including alzheimer’s disease, oncology, pain,
neuroscience, diabetes and inflammation.

 






31









 

we were
required to divest certain animal health assets in connection with the
regulatory approval process associated with our acquisition of
wyeth.  as a result, in october 2009 we sold certain products,
research and manufacturing facilities located primarily in fort dodge, iowa, as
well as related assets and intellectual property, primarily from wyeth’s fort
dodge animal health portfolio in the u.s. and canada to boehringer ingelheim
(bi). the products primarily included cattle and small animal vaccines and some
animal health pharmaceuticals.  bi also acquired certain animal health
assets in other jurisdictions, including companion animal vaccines in australia,
and cattle vaccines in south africa, all of which are primarily manufactured at
the fort dodge, iowa site. bi has agreed to acquire certain cattle vaccines in
the european union, pending approval from the european commission. in the
european union, switzerland, mexico, china, and australia, in connection with
the regulatory approval process associated with our acquisition of wyeth, we are
also required to divest certain other animal health assets for which we have not
yet identified a buyer.  it is possible that additional divestitures
of animal health assets may be required based on ongoing regulatory reviews in
other jurisdictions worldwide.

due to
the significant limitations on access to information relating to wyeth prior to
the acquisition date, and the limited time since the acquisition date, the
initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete at this
time.  we will include this information in our 2009 annual report on
form 10-k. additional information, such as the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements of pfizer and wyeth as of and for the six months
ended june 28, 2009 and for the year ended december 31, 2008, can be found in
pfizer’s current report on form 8-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange
commission on october 21, 2009.

also, for
additional information, see note 14. subsequent event –
acquisition of wyeth in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.





●  


on
      april 16, 2009, we announced that we entered into an agreement with
      glaxosmithkline plc (gsk) to create a new company focused solely on
      research, development and commercialization of hiv
      medicines.  the transaction closed on october 30, 2009 and the
      new company, viiv healthcare limited (viiv) began operations on november
      2, 2009.  we and gsk have contributed or will contribute certain
      product and pipeline assets to the new company. viiv has a broad product
      portfolio of 11 marketed products, including innovative leading therapies
      such as combivir
      and kivexa
      products and
      selzentry/celsentri
      (maraviroc).  viiv has a pipeline of six innovative and
      targeted medicines, including four compounds in phase 2
      development.  viiv has contracted research and development
      (r&d) and manufacturing services directly from gsk and us and has also
      entered into a new research alliance agreement with gsk and us. under this
      new alliance, viiv will invest in our and gsk’s programs for discovery
      research and development into hiv medicines.  viiv has exclusive
      rights of first negotiation in relation to any new hiv-related medicines
      developed by either gsk or us. we initially hold a 15% equity
      interest and gsk holds an 85% equity interest.  the equity
      interests will be adjusted in the event that specified sales and
      regulatory milestones are achieved. our equity interest in viiv could vary
      from 9% to 30.5%, and gsk’s equity interest could vary from 69.5% to 91%,
      depending upon the milestones achieved with respect to the original
      pipeline assets contributed by us and by gsk to viiv. each company may
      also be entitled to preferential dividend payments to the extent that
      specific sales thresholds are met in respect of the marketed products and
      pipeline assets originally contributed. we will account for our interest
      in viiv as an equity method
investment.




our cost-reduction
initiatives

we
acquired wyeth on october 15, 2009, and, as a result, we are focusing on the
cost structure of the combined company. through the integration of wyeth, which
began on the day after the acquisition date, and our pfizer cost-reduction
initiatives, we expect to generate significant cost reductions for the combined
company.

overall,
we expect to achieve total annual cost savings of approximately $6 billion by
the end of 2012. these targeted savings include $2 billion in net cost
reductions from pfizer cost-reduction initiatives, of which we have achieved
approximately $950 million through september 27, 2009, and an additional $4
billion in expected synergies related to the integration of wyeth.

we have
incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with these cost-reduction
activities and estimate that these costs could be in the range of approximately
$11.5 billion to $13.5 billion through 2012, of which we have incurred $2.3
billion through september 27, 2009. these costs will be expensed as
incurred.

we expect
to achieve these cost savings through:





●  


the
      closing of duplicative facilities and other site rationalization actions
      company-wide, including research and development facilities, manufacturing
      plants, sales offices and other corporate
  facilities;








●  


workforce
      reductions and other organizational
changes;








●  


the
      increased use of shared services;
and








●  


procurement
      savings.

pfizer
cost-reduction initiatives
 
during
2008, we completed the cost-reduction initiatives that were launched in early
2005, broadened in october 2006 and expanded in january 2007. these initiatives
were designed to increase efficiency and streamline decision-making across the
company and change the way we run our businesses to meet the challenges of a
changing business environment, as well as take advantage of the diverse
opportunities in the marketplace. these and other actions have allowed us to
reduce costs in support services and facilities.

on
january 26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new pfizer cost-reduction
initiative that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs
of approximately $3 billion, on a constant currency basis at 2008 exchange
rates, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total costs. we plan
to reinvest approximately $1 billion of these savings in the business, resulting
in an expected $2 billion net decrease compared to our 2008 adjusted total
costs. as stated above, these targeted savings will now be considered in the
context of the newly combined company for a total target of $6 billion in
reductions by the end of 2012. for an understanding of adjusted income, see the
“adjusted income” section of this md&a.

as part
of the pfizer cost-reduction initiative announced in january 2009, and without
consideration of synergies expected to be achieved in connection with the wyeth
acquisition, we intend to reduce our total worldwide workforce by approximately
10% from the year-end 2008 level. reductions span sales, manufacturing, research
and development, and administrative organizations. in the third quarter of 2009,
we reduced our workforce by approximately 1,100 employees and, in the first nine
months of 2009, we reduced our workforce by approximately 6,500 employees. these
declines were net of new employees hired in expanding areas of our business. we
also intend to reduce our facilities square footage by approximately 15%. we
expect to incur costs related to this cost-reduction initiative of approximately
$5.5 billion, pre-tax, of which $1.5 billion was recorded in 2008. during the
third quarter of 2009, we incurred costs related to this cost-reduction
initiative of $141 million and, in the first nine months of 2009, we incurred
costs related to this cost-reduction initiative of $802 million. for additional
details on amounts incurred related to our cost-reduction initiatives, see the
“costs and expenses – cost-reduction initiatives” section of this
md&a.

projects
related to pfizer cost-reduction initiatives, without consideration of any
impacts in connection with the acquisition of wyeth, in various stages of
implementation include:

pfizer
global research and development (pgrd)




●  


creating a more agile and
      productive organization—in january 2009, we announced that we plan
      to reduce our global research staff. we expect these reductions, which are
      part of the planned 10% total workforce reduction discussed above, will be
      completed during 2009.




after a
review of all our therapeutic areas, in 2008, we announced our decision to exit
certain disease areas and give higher priority to the following disease areas:
alzheimer's disease, diabetes, inflammation/immunology, oncology, pain and
psychoses (schizophrenia). we also will continue to work in many other disease
areas, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, genitourinary,
infectious diseases, ophthalmology, smoking cessation, thrombosis and
transplant, among others. these decisions did not affect our portfolio of
marketed products, the development of compounds then in phase 3 or any launches
planned through 2011.

we
continue to focus on reduced cycle time and improved compound survival in the
drug discovery and development process. over the next two years, our goal,
without consideration of any impacts in connection with the acquisition of
wyeth, is to realize a 25% to 33% reduction in cycle time in the period from
final approved protocol to last subject-first visit, as new processes and
procedures are adopted for newly initiated phase 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. in
the past couple of years, a number of steps have been taken to improve compound
survival, such as rigorous analyses of the successful and unsuccessful projects
in the entire portfolio, to ensure that results are captured and applied to
ongoing programs and to portfolio decisions.

pfizer
global manufacturing (pgm)




●  


supply network transformation - we are
      transforming our global manufacturing network into a global strategic
      supply network, consisting of our internal network of plants together with
      strategic external manufacturers, and including purchasing, packaging and
      distribution. as of the end of the third quarter of 2009, we have reduced
      our internal network of plants from 93 in 2003 to 43, which includes the
      acquisition of seven plants and the sites sold in 2006 as part of our
      consumer healthcare business. we plan to reduce our internal network of
      plants, without consideration of plants acquired in the wyeth acquisition,
      around the world to 41, resulting in a more focused, streamlined and
      competitive manufacturing operation, with less than 50% of our former
      internal plants and more than 53% fewer manufacturing employees, compared
      to 2003. as part of the transformation to a global strategic supply
      network, we currently expect to increase outsourced manufacturing from
      approximately 24% of our products, on a cost basis, to approximately 30%
      over the next two years, without consideration of products acquired in the
      wyeth acquisition.

worldwide
pharmaceutical operations (wpo)








●  


reorganization of our field
      force - as part of pfizer’s overall restructuring into smaller,
      more focused business units, we have changed our global field force
      operations to enable us to adapt to changing market dynamics and respond
      to local customer needs more quickly and with more flexibility. this
      process, which began in 2007, is generating savings from de-layering,
      eliminating duplicative work, and utilizing our sales representatives more
      efficiently through targeted deployment, offset modestly by increased
      investment in certain emerging markets. between 2004 and the end of the
      third quarter of 2009, we reduced our global field force by approximately
      21%, with approximately 19% of the total reductions occurring since the
      beginning of 2007.

pharmaceutical business
revenues
 

worldwide
pharmaceutical revenues decreased 3% for the third quarter of 2009 and 6% for
the first nine months of 2009, primarily due to:





●  


the
      strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily
      the euro, u.k. pound, canadian dollar, australian dollar and brazilian
      real, which unfavorably impacted pharmaceutical revenues by approximately
      $555 million, or 5%, in the third quarter of 2009 and by approximately
      $2.1 billion, or 6%, in the first nine months of
  2009;




 






34









 





●  


an
      operational decrease in worldwide revenues for lipitor of $137 million in
      the third quarter of 2009 and $394 million in the first nine months of
      2009, primarily resulting from competitive pressures from generics, among
      other factors;








●  


an
      aggregate decrease in revenues for norvasc and camptosar of $114 million
      in the third quarter of 2009 and for norvasc, camptosar and zyrtec/zyrtec
      d of $515 million in the first nine months of 2009, due to the loss of
      norvasc exclusivity in japan in july 2008, the loss of exclusivity of
      camptosar in the u.s. in february 2008 and in europe in july 2009, and the
      loss of u.s. exclusivity and cessation of selling of zyrtec/zyrtec d in
      january 2008; and








●  


a
      decrease in worldwide revenues for chantix/champix of $27 million in the
      third quarter of 2009 and $142 million in the first nine months of 2009,
      primarily resulting from changes to the chantix label during 2008 and in
      july 2009, among other factors;




partially
offset by:





●  


solid
      operational performance from certain products, including lyrica and
      sutent, and higher alliance revenues;
and








●  


a
      $217 million adjustment in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008
      related to the prior years’ liabilities for product
    returns.




geographically,





●  


in
      the u.s., pharmaceutical revenues decreased 2% in the third quarter of
      2009 primarily due to lower sales of lipitor, celebrex and lyrica and 5%
      in the first nine months of 2009, primarily due to lower sales of lipitor
      and celebrex, compared to the respective year-ago periods, as a result of
      continued generic pressures. revenues also were adversely affected by the
      loss of exclusivity of camptosar and zyrtec/zyrtec d, lower sales of
      chantix following the changes to the product label, increased rebates as a
      result of the impact of certain contract changes, and increased pricing
      pressures. these factors were partially offset by the solid performance
      from certain products, including revatio, xalatan and sutent, and higher
      alliance revenue in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009;
      and








●  


in
      our international markets, pharmaceutical revenues decreased 4% in the
      third quarter of 2009 and 7% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to
      the same periods of 2008, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of
      foreign exchange on international revenues of $555 million, or 9%, in the
      third quarter of 2009 and $2.1 billion, or 11%, in the first nine months
      of 2009, and lower sales of norvasc, camptosar and viagra, partially
      offset by operational growth from certain products, including lipitor,
      lyrica, zyvox, vfend and sutent, and higher alliance
    revenues.




during
the third quarter of 2009, international pharmaceutical revenues represented
58.3% of total pharmaceutical revenues, compared to 58.8% in the third quarter
of 2008. during the first nine months of 2009, international pharmaceutical
revenues represented 56.7% of total pharmaceutical revenues, compared to 57.4%
in the first nine months of 2008.

effective
august 14, 2009 and january 3, 2009, we increased the published prices for
certain u.s. pharmaceutical products. these price increases had no material
effect on wholesaler inventory levels in comparison to the prior
year.

as is
typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a
variety of deductions, that are generally estimated and recorded in the same
period that the revenues are recognized. these deductions primarily represent
rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and
managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. as these
deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, judgment and
knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the
impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our
overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results
generally have been less than 1% of pharmaceutical net sales and can result in
either a net increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate
charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual
product growth trends.

rebates
under medicaid and related state programs reduced revenues by $133 million in
the third quarter of 2009, compared to $113 million in the third quarter of
2008, and by $441 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $356
million in the first nine months of 2008. the increases in rebates under
medicaid and related state programs were due primarily to increased rates for
certain products and a favorable adjustment recorded in the first nine months of
2008 to adjust for the estimated impact of the deficit reduction
act.

rebates
under medicare reduced revenues by $209 million in the third quarter of 2009,
compared to $201 million in the third quarter of 2008, and by $653 million in
the first nine months of 2009, compared to $623 million in the first nine months
of 2008, due primarily to increased rebates for certain products.
 






35










performance-based
contract and other rebates reduced revenues by $556 million in the third quarter
of 2009, compared to $510 million in the third quarter of 2008, and by $1.7
billion in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $1.5 billion in the first
nine months of 2008. the increases in performance-based contract and other
rebates were due primarily to the impact of certain contract changes which
resulted in increased rates related to lipitor. these contracts are with managed
care customers, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit
managers, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance
terms for products. rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given
period are impacted by the mix of products sold.
 
chargebacks
(primarily reimbursements to wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third
parties) reduced revenues by $495 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared
to $431 million in the third quarter of 2008, and by $1.5 billion in the first
nine months of 2009, compared to $1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2008.
the increases in chargebacks were due primarily to increased sales that are
subject to chargebacks in addition to increased competitive pricing
factors.
 
our
accruals for medicaid and related state programs rebates, medicare rebates,
performance-based contract and other rebates and chargebacks totaled $1.8
billion as of september 27, 2009, an increase from $1.6 billion as of december
31, 2008, due primarily to the impact of certain contract changes and increased
pricing pressures.

product descriptions:





●  


lipitor, for the
      treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood, is the most
      widely used branded prescription treatment for lowering cholesterol and
      the best-selling prescription pharmaceutical product of any kind in the
      world. lipitor recorded worldwide revenues of $2.9 billion or a decrease
      of 9% in the third quarter of 2009 and $8.3 billion or a decrease of 11%
      in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008.
      these results in part reflect the negative impact of foreign exchange,
      which decreased revenues by $153 million, or 5%, in the third quarter of
      2009, and $603 million, or 6%, in the first nine months of 2009, compared
      to the same periods in 2008. in the u.s., revenues were $1.4 billion or a
      decrease of 12% in the third quarter of 2009 and $4.1 billion or a
      decrease of 12% in the first nine months of 2009, compared with the same
      periods in 2008. internationally, lipitor revenues were $1.5 billion or a
      decrease of 6% in the third quarter of 2009 and $4.1 billion or a decrease
      of 9% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in
      2008. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange more than offset
      operational growth of 3% in international markets in the third quarter of
      2009 and 4% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods
      last year.




the
decrease in lipitor worldwide revenues in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 was driven by a combination
of factors, including the following:





●  


primarily,
      the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange; as well
  as








●  


the
      impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition
      from multi-source generics and branded products in the
    u.s.;








●  


increased
      payer pressure in the u.s.; and








●  


slower
      growth in the lipid-lowering market, due in part to a slower rate of
      growth in the medicare part d population and, reflecting the global
      recession, heightened overall patient cost-sensitivity in the u.s. and
      adoption of non-prescription treatment
options;



 

partially
offset by:

 




●  


operational
      growth internationally.

proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain patent
litigation relating to lipitor.

norvasc, for treating
      hypertension, lost exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2007. norvasc has also
      experienced patent expirations in most other major markets, including
      japan in july 2008. norvasc worldwide revenues decreased by 13% in both
      the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2009 compared to the
      same periods in 2008.








●  


chantix/champix, the
      first new prescription treatment to aid smoking cessation in nearly a
      decade, has been launched in all major markets. chantix/ champix worldwide
      revenues decreased 15% in the third quarter of 2009 and 21% in the first
      nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008. year-to-date
      revenues for chantix have declined compared to last year following the
      changes to the product’s label and other factors. we are continuing our
      educational and promotional efforts, which are focused on the chantix
      benefit-risk proposition, the significant health consequences of smoking
      and the importance of the physician-patient dialogue in helping patients
      quit smoking.




in
january 2008, we added a warning to chantix’s label that patients who are taking
chantix should be observed by a physician for neuropsychiatric symptoms. in may
2008, we updated the chantix label to provide further guidance about the safe
use of chantix. the updated label advises that patients should stop taking
chantix and contact their healthcare provider immediately if agitation,
depressed mood or changes in behavior that are not typical for them are
observed, or if they develop suicidal thoughts or suicidal
behavior.

in july
2009, we further updated the chantix label to highlight reports of serious
neuropsychiatric events in a boxed warning; updated the warning about reports of
neuropsychiatric symptoms and suicidality; added warnings about reports of
allergic reactions and serious skin reactions; and updated precautionary
information about driving or operating machinery to include details about
reports of accidental injury. the boxed warning about reports of serious
neuropsychiatric events was also added to the labels of prescription
smoking-cessation aids produced by other pharmaceutical companies. additionally,
the boxed warning communicates that the health benefits of quitting smoking are
immediate and substantial, the risk of chantix should be weighed against the
benefit of its use, and that chantix has been demonstrated to increase the
likelihood of quitting for as long as one year compared to placebo. these
updates will help further enhance discussions between physicians and patients
about the benefits and risks of chantix.

caduet, a single-pill
      therapy combining norvasc and lipitor, recorded decreases in worldwide
      revenues of 12% in the third quarter of 2009 and 11% in the first nine
      months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, primarily due to
      increased generic competition as well as an overall decline in u.s.
      hypertension market volume.

revatio, for the
      treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, recorded an increase in
      worldwide revenues of 18% in the third quarter of 2009 and 33% in the
      first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, primarily
      due to the recent fda approval of enhanced labeling and market trends
      toward earlier diagnosis and
treatment.

lyrica, indicated for
      the management of post-herpetic neuralgia (phn), diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (dpn), fibromyalgia, and as adjunctive therapy for adult
      patients with partial onset seizures in the u.s., and for neuropathic
      pain, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and general anxiety disorder (gad)
      outside the u.s., recorded increases in worldwide revenues of 5% in the
      third quarter of 2009 and 8% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to
      the same periods in 2008. in the u.s., revenues have been adversely
      affected by increased generic competition as well as managed care pricing
      and formulary pressures.




in july
2008, an fda advisory committee concurred with the fda’s finding of a potential
increased signal regarding suicidal thoughts and behavior for the class of 11
epilepsy drugs reviewed, including lyrica and neurontin. in april 2009, we
updated the labels for lyrica, neurontin and certain older epilepsy medications
to include this new warning. we are confident in the efficacy and safety profile
of all of our products for their approved indications.

geodon/zeldox, a
      psychotropic agent, is a dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist
      indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed
      episodes associated with bipolar disorder. geodon recorded decreases in
      worldwide revenues of 2% in the third quarter of 2009 and 3% in the first
      nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, due to
      increased generic competition, slow growth in the antipsychotic market in
      the u.s., as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign
      exchange.

celebrex, a treatment
      for the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and
      acute pain in adults, experienced a decrease in worldwide revenues of 4%
      in the third quarter of 2009 and 6% in the first nine months of 2009,
      compared to the same periods in 2008, due to increased generic
      competition. celebrex is supported by continued educational and
      promotional efforts highlighting its efficacy and safety profile for
      appropriate patients.

zyvox is the world’s
      best-selling branded agent for the treatment of certain serious
      gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant
      staphylococcus-aureus (mrsa). mrsa remains a serious and growing threat in
      hospitals and the community. zyvox is an excellent first-line choice for
      the treatment of adults and children with complicated skin and skin
      structure infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia due to known or
      suspected mrsa. zyvox is the only fda-approved agent for mrsa that offers
      intravenous and oral formulations for these indications. its unique
      mechanism of action makes cross-resistance unlikely. zyvox worldwide
      revenues decreased 3% in the third quarter of 2009 and 2% in the first
      nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, mainly due to a
      decrease in the number of patients treated for pneumonia and to increased
      generic competition in the u.s. as well as competition from recently
      launched agents in certain high-volume international markets such as the
      u.k.

      internationally, viagra revenues decreased by 14% in the third quarter of
      2009 and 17% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same
      periods in 2008, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of foreign
      exchange.

detrol/detrol la, a
      muscarinic receptor antagonist, is the most prescribed branded medicine
      worldwide for overactive bladder. detrol la is an extended-release
      formulation taken once a day. detrol/detrol la worldwide revenues declined
      5% in the third quarter of 2009 and 6% in the first nine months of 2009,
      compared to the same periods in 2008, primarily due to increased
      competition from other branded

sutent, for the treatment
      of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gist) after disease
      progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate, was launched in the
      u.s. in january 2006. it has now been launched in all major markets.
      sutent worldwide revenues increased 9% in the third quarter of 2009 and 7%
      in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008. we
      continue to drive total revenue and prescription growth, supported by
      cost-effectiveness data and efficacy data in first-line mrcc – including
      2-year survival data, which represents the first time overall survival of
      two years has been seen in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, as

camptosar, indicated as
      first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with
      5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, lost exclusivity in the u.s. in february
      2008 and major european countries in july 2009. it is also indicated for
      patients in whom metastatic colorectal cancer has recurred or progressed
      following initial fluorouracil-based therapy. camptosar is for intravenous
      use only. camptosar worldwide revenues decreased 33% in the third quarter
      of 2009 and 39% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same
      periods in 2008, primarily as a result of the loss of
      exclusivity.

      in the third quarter of 2009 and 4% in the first nine months of 2009,
      compared to the same periods in 2008, due to the unfavorable impact of
      foreign exchange.

      genotropin is supported by a broad platform of innovative
      injection-delivery devices. genotropin worldwide revenues increased 3% in
      the third quarter of 2009 and decreased 5% in the first nine months of
      2009.  the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was more than
      offset by the operational revenue increases in the third quarter of 2009
      and partially offset by the operational revenue increases in the first
      nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods in

animal
health revenues decreased 4% in the third quarter of 2009, compared to the same
period last year, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of
6% and decreased 9% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same
period in 2008, due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. in addition,
year-to-date revenues were impacted by:





●  


the
      global recession, which negatively affected global spending on veterinary
      care;








●  


historically
      low milk prices, which have hurt the profitability of dairy farmers and
      negatively impacted our livestock business;
and








●  


a

      anticipated, one-time reduction in u.s. distributor inventories in the
      first quarter of 2009.




product
developments

we
continue to invest in r&d to provide future sources of revenues through the
development of new products, as well as through additional uses for existing
in-line and alliance products, and we have taken important steps to prioritize
our research and development portfolio to maximize value. after a review of all
our therapeutic areas, in 2008, we announced our decision to exit certain
disease areas and give higher priority to the following disease areas:
alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, inflammation/immunology, oncology, pain and
psychoses (schizophrenia). we will also continue to work in many other disease
areas, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, genitourinary,
infectious diseases, ophthalmology, smoking cessation, thrombosis and
transplant, among others. these decisions did not affect our portfolio of
marketed products, the development of compounds then in phase 3 or any launches
planned through 2011. notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to
when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for
existing products or any of our other products in development.
 






40









 

we remain
on track to achieve the 2008-2009 r&d goals that we announced in march 2008.
we now expect to advance 15 new molecular entities and new indications to phase
3 during the 2008-2009 period. we continue to expect to have a total of 24 to 28
programs in phase 3 by the end of 2009. early in 2010, we plan to update our
target range for regulatory submissions during the 2010-2012 period to reflect
the wyeth acquisition.

in june
2009, we resubmitted a data package to the fda for lyrica for the treatment of
generalized anxiety disorder (gad) monotherapy in response to a “not-approvable”
letter issued by the fda in august 2004.

on april
16, 2009, we announced that we entered into an agreement with glaxosmithkline
plc (gsk) to create a new company focused solely on research, development and
commercialization of hiv medicines.  the transaction closed on october
30, 2009 and the new company, viiv began operations on november 2,
2009.  we have contributed selzentry/celsentri (maraviroc), among
other assets, to viiv (see further discussion in the “our strategic initiatives
- - strategy and recent transactions: acquisitions, licensing and collaborations”
section of this md&a). in
october 2009, an fda advisory committee voted (10 to 4) to recommend the
approval by the fda of selzentry (maraviroc) tablets for use in treatment-naïve
adult patients with ccr5-tropic hiv-1 virus as part of combination
therapy.

in june
2009, an fda advisory committee concluded that geodon is effective for the
treatment of bipolar mania in children ages 10 to 17. eight members of the
committee also concluded that geodon is acceptably safe for that indication,
with one committee member disagreeing and nine additional committee members
abstaining. on october 30, 2009, we received a “complete response” letter from
the fda with respect to this nda. the fda is seeking additional information and
is requesting that we take certain actions with regard to the submission. we are
working with the fda to address its requests and recommendations.

we
received “not-approvable” letters from the fda for fablyn (lasofoxifene) for the
prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis in september 2005 and for the
treatment of vaginal atrophy in january 2006. we submitted a second nda for the
treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women in december 2007, including
the three-year interim data from the postmenopausal evaluation and
risk-reduction with lasofoxifene (pearl) study in support of the new nda. in
september 2008, nine of the 13 members of an fda advisory committee concluded
that there is a population of women with post-menopausal osteoporosis for which
the benefit of treatment with fablyn is likely to outweigh the risks. we
received a “complete response” letter from the fda in january 2009.
subsequently, following a strategic review, we decided to explore strategic
options for fablyn, including out-licensing or sale.
 
bi, our
alliance partner, holds the u.s. nda for spiriva. in september 2008, bi received
a “complete response” letter from the fda for the spiriva respimat submission.
the fda is seeking additional data, and we are coordinating with bi, which is
working with the fda to provide the additional information. a full response will
be submitted to the fda upon the completion of ongoing studies.

in
september 2007, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for zmax that
sets forth requirements to obtain approval for the pediatric acute otitis media
(aom) indication based on pharmacokinetic data. a supplemental filing for
pediatric aom and sinusitis remains under review.

in
december 2005, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for our vfend
pediatric filing, which sets forth the additional requirements for approval. we
have been systematically working through these requirements and addressing the
fda’s concerns, including initiation of an additional pharmacokinetics study in
november 2008.

in june
2008, we completed the acquisition of encysive pharmaceuticals inc. (encysive),
whose main asset is thelin. in june 2007, encysive received a third “approvable”
letter from the fda for thelin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial
hypertension (pah). we began an additional phase 3 clinical trial in patients
with pah during the fourth quarter of 2008 to address the concerns of the fda
regarding efficacy as reflected in that letter.

in
february 2009, fablyn received approval in europe for the treatment of
osteoporosis. subsequently, following a strategic review, we decided to explore
strategic options for fablyn, including out-licensing or sale.

in april
2009, the european medicines agency’s committee for medicinal products for human
use (chmp) issued a negative opinion, recommending that the european commission
not add an indication for the treatment of fibromyalgia to the marketing
authorization for lyrica. the chmp was of the opinion that the benefits of
lyrica in the treatment of fibromyalgia did not outweigh its risks. on july 23,
2009, the chmp confirmed the negative opinion for the treatment of fibromyalgia
for lyrica. as a result, this indication will not be added to the marketing
authorization for lyrica in the eu. lyrica remains approved in europe for the
indications of neuropathic pain, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and
gad.

we are no
longer seeking approval in the eu for celsentri (maraviroc) for the treatment of
hiv in treatment-naïve patients. celsentri (maraviroc), remains approved in the
eu for use in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal
products  for treatment-experienced adult patients with
only  ccr5-tropic hiv-1 detectable.

in early
2009, we had four phase 3 studies evaluating sutent in advanced breast cancer.
in march 2009, we discontinued a phase 3 trial of single-agent sutent versus
xeloda (capecitabine) for treatment of advanced breast cancer. in june 2009, we
discontinued another phase 3 trial that compared sutent plus taxol (paclitaxel)
to avastin (bevacizumab) plus taxol as first-line treatment of advanced breast
cancer. both studies were discontinued due to futility. we continue to study
sutent in advanced breast cancer in two other phase 3 trials, which have
completed enrollment. in june 2009, we discontinued a phase 3 trial of sutent
for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer due to
futility.

acquisition-related
in-process research and development charges

as
required through december 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (ipr&d) was expensed at acquisition
date. ipr&d of $567 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2008,
primarily related to our acquisitions of encysive, serenex, covx, coley and two
smaller acquisitions related to animal health. as a result of adopting the
provisions of a new accounting standard related to business combinations issued
by the fasb, beginning january 1, 2009, ipr&d related to acquisitions after
adoption will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived
intangible assets. in the first nine months of 2009, we resolved a contingency
associated with covx and recorded $20 million in acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges. no acquisitions were consummated in the
first nine months of 2009.

cost-reduction
initiatives

we
acquired wyeth on october 15, 2009 and, as a result, we are focusing on the cost
structure of the combined company. through the integration of wyeth, which began
on the day after the acquisition date, and our pfizer cost-reduction
initiatives, we expect to generate significant cost reductions for the combined
company.

overall,
we expect to achieve total annual cost savings of approximately $6 billion by
the end of 2012. these targeted savings include $2 billion in net cost
reductions from pfizer cost-reduction initiatives, of which we have achieved
approximately $950 million through september 27, 2009, and an additional $4
billion in expected synergies related to the integration of wyeth.

we have
incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with these cost-reduction
activities and estimate that these costs could be in the range of approximately
$11.5 billion to $13.5 billion through 2012, of which we have incurred $2.3
billion through september 27, 2009. these costs will be expensed as
incurred.

we expect
to achieve these cost savings through:





●  


the
      closing of duplicative facilities and other site rationalization actions
      company-wide, including research and development facilities, manufacturing
      plants, sales offices and other corporate
  facilities;








●  


workforce
      reductions and other organizational
changes;








●  


the
      increased use of shared services;
and








●  


procurement
      savings.

pfizer
cost-reduction initiatives


during
2008, we completed the cost-reduction initiatives that were launched in early
2005, broadened in october 2006 and expanded in january 2007. these initiatives
were designed to increase efficiency and streamline decision-making across the
company and change the way we run our businesses to meet the challenges of a
changing business environment, as well as take advantage of the diverse
opportunities in the marketplace. these and other actions have allowed us to
reduce costs in support services and facilities.

on
january 26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new pfizer cost-reduction
initiative that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs
of approximately $3 billion, on a constant currency basis at 2008 exchange
rates, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total costs. we plan
to reinvest approximately $1 billion of these savings in the business, resulting
in an expected $2 billion net decrease compared to our 2008 adjusted total
costs. as stated above, these targeted savings will now be considered in the
context of the newly combined company for a total target of $6 billion in
reductions by the end of 2012. for an understanding of adjusted income, see the
“adjusted income” section of this md&a.

the
actions associated with our pfizer cost-reduction initiatives resulted in
restructuring charges, such as asset impairments, exit costs and severance costs
(including any related impacts to our benefit plans, including settlements and
curtailments) and associated implementation costs, such as depreciation arising
from the shortening of the useful lives of certain assets, primarily associated
with supply network transformation efforts and expenses associated with system
and process standardization and the expansion of shared services
worldwide.

the
following costs were incurred in connection with all of our pfizer
cost-reduction initiatives, which began in 2005, and do not include any amounts

      costs include banking, legal, accounting and other costs directly related

      date are fees related to a $22.5 billion bridge term loan credit agreement
      entered into with certain financial institutions on march 12, 2009, to partially fund
      our acquisition of wyeth. the bridge term loan credit agreement was
      terminated in june 2009 as a result of our issuance of approximately $24.0
      billion of senior unsecured notes during the first half of 2009. all
      bridge term loan commitment fees have been expensed, and we are no longer
      subject to the covenants under that agreement. (see note 8d: financial
      instruments: long-term
debt).







(b)


pre-integration
      costs and other in the 2009 periods primarily represent external,
      incremental costs of integration planning that are directly related to our
      acquisition of wyeth and include costs associated with preparing for
      systems and other integration activities. 2008 amounts relate to other
      restructuring charges.

other (income)/deductions -
net

other
(income)/deductions - net changed favorably by $561 million in the third quarter
of 2009 and $46 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same
periods in 2008. the year-over-year improvements were due mainly to
litigation-related charges in the year-ago periods of approximately $900 million
related to the resolution of certain litigation involving our non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory (nsaid) pain medicines.

these
improvements were partially offset by higher net interest expense in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008. in
the third quarter of 2009 we recorded net interest expense of $198 million,
compared to $186 million of net interest income in the same period in 2008, and
in the first nine months of 2009, we recorded net interest expense of $149
million, compared to $488 million of net interest income in the same period in
2008. the lower net interest income for the third quarter and first nine months
ended september 27, 2009 is primarily due to net interest expense associated
with the $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes that we issued in march 2009
and the approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes that we issued in
june 2009 primarily related to the acquisition of wyeth. in addition, lower
interest rates, partially offset by higher cash balances, contributed to the
lower net interest income compared to the prior-year periods.
 

provision for taxes on
income

our
effective tax rate for continuing operations was 27.5% for the third quarter of
2009, compared to 17.0% for the third quarter of 2008, and 27.3% for the first
nine months of 2009, compared to 13.8% for the first nine months of 2008. the
higher tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 are
primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the wyeth acquisition and the change in the
geographic mix of expenses incurred to execute our cost-reduction initiatives,
partially offset by a tax benefit of $174 million recorded in the third quarter
of 2009 related to the final resolution of a previously disclosed
agreement-in-principle with the u.s. department of justice to settle
investigations of past promotional practices and certain other
matters.  this resulted in the receipt of information that raised our
assessment of the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of our tax
position.  the higher tax rates were also partially offset by the
decrease in ipr&d charges, which generally are not deductible for tax
purposes. the lower tax rate in the first nine months of 2008 reflects tax
benefits of $305 million related to favorable tax settlements for multiple tax
years and $426 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical
companies, which were both recorded in the first half of 2008.

adjusted
income

general description of
adjusted income measure

adjusted
income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe
that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this
performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results
of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and
sale of prescription medicines for humans and animals––prior to considering
certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net
income
attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for
acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain
significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed
as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income.

the
adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we
measure the performance of the overall company on this basis, in conjunction
with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted
income measure is utilized.





●  


senior
      management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is
      prepared on an adjusted income
basis;








●  


our
      annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis;
    and








●  


senior
      management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted
      income measure. adjusted income is one of the performance metrics utilized
      in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual
      incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the
      executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code
      section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are
      funded from a pool based on the achievement of three financial metrics,
      including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from
      adjusted income. these metrics derived from adjusted income account for
      (i) 17% of the target bonus for elt members and (ii) 33% of the bonus pool
      made available to elt members and other members of senior
      management.










46









 
despite
the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance
measurement, we stress that adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that
has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits
in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition,
adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the
calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented
solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our
performance.

we also
recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income
measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performance-management
process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is
that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a
period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased
intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other
companies in the pharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically
tailored tools designed to ensure the highest levels of our performance. for
example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its
effectiveness is measured. in addition, the earn-out of performance share award
grants is determined based on a non-discretionary formula that measures our
performance using relative total shareholder return.

purchase accounting
adjustments

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering certain significant
purchase-accounting impacts, such as those related to business combinations and
net asset acquisitions (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
– note 3.
acquisitions).
these impacts can include charges for purchased in-process r&d, the
incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was
written up to fair value and the incremental charges related to the amortization
of finite-lived intangible assets for the increase to fair value. therefore, the
adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the
acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant
charges.

certain
of the purchase-accounting adjustments associated with a business combination,
such as the amortization of intangibles acquired in connection with our
acquisition of pharmacia in 2003, can occur for up to 40 years (these assets
have a weighted-average useful life of approximately nine years), but this
presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by
management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination
of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management
and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a
degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research
and development costs have been previously expensed.

however,
a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and
acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this
component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items
listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the
impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we
had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this
approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have
occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs
in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to
commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our
costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts
may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there
can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as
presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible
assets.

acquisition-related
costs

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering integration and restructuring costs
associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each
transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate
two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity,
only transaction costs and restructuring and integration activities that are
associated with a purchase business combination or a net-asset acquisition are
included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the
resulting synergies.

we
believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides
investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs
incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate
duplicate assets, activities or employees –– a natural result of acquiring a
fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs
incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to
eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business
combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more
normal business contexts.

the
integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may
occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three
years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for
some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and
integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated
nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take
several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation
and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory
authorities.







47









 
discontinued
operations

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in
discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the sale of
such operations. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors
because, while we review our businesses and product lines periodically for
strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with an
intent to sell them.

certain significant
items

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain
significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an
individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the
qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may
represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as
a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our
normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items
that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of
items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major
non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs
for a program which is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those
related to our pfizer cost-reduction initiatives; charges related to certain
sales or disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued
operations as defined by u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transition service
agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible
asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax
positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax
legislation; net interest expense incurred through the consummation date of the
acquisition of wyeth on acquisition-related borrowings made prior to that date;
or possible charges related to legal matters, such as certain of those discussed
in legal proceedings in
our form 10-k and in part ii. other information; item 1.
legal proceedings,
included in our form 10-q filings. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company
or settlements and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our
business would not be considered certain significant items.

we rely
largely on operating cash flow, short-term investments, short-term commercial
paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for the working capital needs of
our operations, including our r&d activities. we believe that we have the
ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs
for the foreseeable future. the overall increase in net financial assets, as
shown above, reflects cash flows from operating activities partially offset by
dividend payments. the significant changes in the components of net financial
assets, as shown above, are as follows:





●  


we
      issued $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on march 24, 2009 and
      approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on june 3, 2009, of
      which virtually all of the proceeds were used to partially finance our
      acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009. as of september 27, 2009, prior
      to the close of the wyeth acquisition, the note proceeds were generally
      invested in short-term available-for-sale investments. our long-term debt
      increased in the first nine months of 2009 primarily as a result of the
      issuances of these senior unsecured
notes.








●  


our
      short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality,
      investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. wherever possible,
      cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to
      provide working capital to our operations. where local restrictions
      prevent intercompany financing, working capital needs are met through
      operating cash flows and/or external borrowings. our portfolio of
      financial assets increased in the first nine months of 2009 as a result of
      the proceeds of the notes issued in anticipation of the acquisition of
      wyeth.




on
october 15, 2009, we completed our acquisition of wyeth. the cash portion of the
purchase price totaled approximately $44.9 billion and was funded with available
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. for additional information on
our acquisition of wyeth, see note 14. subsequent event –
acquisition of wyeth in the notes to condensed consolidated financial
statements.

credit
ratings

two major
corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s investors service (moody’s) and
standard & poor’s (s&p), assign ratings to our short-term and long-term
debt. the following chart reflects the current ratings assigned by these rating
agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit enhanced
long-term debt issued by us:

as
expected, on october 15, 2009, moody’s downgraded our long-term-debt credit
rating to a1, its fifth-highest investment grade rating. moody’s indicated that
the downgrade reflects the strategic benefits of the wyeth acquisition offset by
higher financial leverage in the transaction. also as expected, on october 16,
2009, s&p downgraded our long-term-debt credit rating to aa, its
third-highest investment grade rating. s&p indicated that the downgrade
reflects the challenge to realize earnings and cash flow in light of pending
patent expirations offset by the addition of wyeth products to our
portfolio.  both moody’s and s&p reaffirmed our commercial paper
ratings at their highest respective ratings.

debt
capacity

we have
available lines of credit and revolving-credit agreements with a group of banks
and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent
balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other
short-term borrowings. as of september 27, 2009, we had access to $8.3 billion
of lines of credit, of which $6.2 billion expire
within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.2 billion are unused, of which our
lenders have committed to loan us $7.0 billion at our request. unused lines of
credit of $7.0 billion, of which $5.0 billion expire in 2010 and $2.0 billion
expire in 2013, may be used to support our commercial paper
borrowings.

in march
2007, we filed a securities registration statement with the securities and
exchange commission. this registration statement was filed under the automatic
“shelf registration” process available to “well-known seasoned issuers” and is
effective for three years. we can issue securities of various types under that
registration statement at any time, subject to approval by our board of
directors in certain circumstances. on march 24, 2009, in order to partially
finance our acquisition of wyeth, we issued $13.5 billion of senior unsecured
notes under this registration statement.

on june
3, 2009, also in order to partially finance the wyeth acquisition, we issued
approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in a private placement
pursuant to regulation s under the securities act of 1933, as amended. the notes
were offered overseas and may not be sold in the united states. as a result of
the issuances of the senior unsecured notes during the first half of 2009, the
$22.5 billion bridge term loan credit agreement, which we entered into on march
12, 2009, to partially fund our acquisition of wyeth, was
terminated.

for
additional information related to our long-term debt, see notes to condensed
consolidated financial statements - note 8d. financial instruments:
long-term debt, and for additional information on our acquisition of
wyeth, see note 14. subsequent
event – acquisition of wyeth.

financial risk
management

due to
the acquisition of wyeth and in light of current market conditions, we currently
borrow primarily on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. we may change this practice
as market conditions change.

changes in global financial
markets

towards
the end of the third quarter of 2008, dramatic changes in the global financial
markets weakened global economic conditions. these changes have not had, nor do
we anticipate they will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our
significant operating cash flow, financial assets, access to the capital markets
and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to
believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable
future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity
position.

goodwill and other
intangible assets

as of
september 27, 2009, goodwill
totaled $21.8 billion (15% of our total assets) and identifiable intangible assets, less
accumulated amortization, totaled $16.1 billion (11% of our total
assets). as of september 27, 2009, finite-lived intangible assets, net, include
$12.3 billion related to developed technology rights and $503 million related to
brands. indefinite-lived intangible assets include $2.9 billion related to
brands.

at least
annually, we review all of our intangible assets, including goodwill, for
impairment. for goodwill, volatility in securities markets and changes in
pfizer’s market capitalization can impact these calculations. we had no
significant impairments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 or
2008. none of our goodwill is impaired as of september 27, 2009.

(b)


represents
      total pfizer inc. shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of
      common shares outstanding (which excludes treasury shares and shares held
      by our employee benefit trust).




the
increases in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and loans,
working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, as of
september 27, 2009, compared to december 31, 2008, were primarily due to the
investment of the proceeds from our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior
unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2009 and our issuance of approximately
$10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in the second quarter of 2009, primarily
in anticipation of our acquisition of wyeth, as well as the timing of accruals,
cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business. the increase in
accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, reflects an increase
in alliance-related receivables, as a result of higher associated revenues, an
increase in certain government receivables and an increase due to foreign
currency impacts; no significant collectibility issues have been
identified.

net cash provided by
operating activities

during
the first nine months of 2009, net cash provided by operating activities was
$11.8 billion, compared to $12.3 billion in the same period of 2008. the lower
net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the
timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.

the cash
flows statement line item other non-cash adjustments
reflects approximately $520 million of asset write-downs in the first nine
months of 2008, mainly associated with assets held for
sale.

net cash used in investing
activities

during
the first nine months of 2009, net cash used in investing activities was $26.9
billion, compared to $10.1 billion in the same period in 2008. the increase in
net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to net
purchases of investments of $26.6 billion in the first nine months of 2009,
primarily reflecting the investment of proceeds from our issuance of $13.5
billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2009 and the proceeds
from our issuance of approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in
the second quarter of 2009, compared to $6.4 billion in the same period in
2008.

net cash provided by/(used
in) financing activities

during
the first nine months of 2009, net cash provided by financing activities was
$17.2 billion, compared to net cash used of $4.3 billion in the same period in
2008. the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily
attributable to:





●  


net
      borrowings of $21.6 billion in the first nine months of 2009, primarily
      reflecting the proceeds from our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior
      unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2009 and the proceeds from our
      issuance of approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in the
      second quarter of 2009, compared to $2.6 billion in
  2008;








●  


lower
      dividend payments in 2009; and








●  


no
      open market purchases of common stock in
2009.




in june
2005, we announced a $5 billion share-purchase program. in june 2006, the board
of directors increased the share purchase authorization from $5 billion to $18
billion. in january 2008, we announced a new $5 billion share-purchase program,
to be funded by operating cash flows, that may be utilized from time to
time.

contractual
obligations

during
the first nine months of 2009, we issued approximately $24.0 billion in senior
unsecured notes. virtually all of the proceeds of the notes were used to
partially finance our acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009. there were no
other significant changes to our contractual obligations as reported in our form
10-k for the year ended december 31, 2008. the table below presents our
long-term debt obligations by fiscal year as of september 27, 2009:

(a)


our
      long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and
      interest obligations. our calculation of expected interest payments
      incorporates only current-period assumptions for interest rates, foreign
      currency translation rates and hedging strategies. (see notes to
      consolidated financial statements—note 8d. financial
      instruments: long-term debt). long-term debt consists of senior,
      fixed-rate and floating-rate, unsecured notes, foreign currency
      denominated notes, and other borrowings and
  mortgages.




off-balance sheet
arrangements

in the
ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and
businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities
that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to
activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to
environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent
infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim
pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse
the loss. these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts,
specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we
have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of september
27, 2009, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these
indemnifications are not significant.

certain
of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the
rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial
conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to
certain of our products.

dividends on common
stock

in
january 2009, in connection with the acquisition of wyeth, the board of
directors determined that, effective with the dividend to be paid in the second
quarter of 2009 and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, it
would reduce our quarterly dividend per share of common stock to $0.16. in
october 2009, the board of directors declared a fourth-quarter dividend of $0.16
per share.

new accounting

see notes
to condensed consolidated financial statements - note 2. adoption of new accounting

recently issued accounting
standards, not adopted as of september 27, 2009

in
september 2009, the fasb issued asu no. 2009-12, which provides guidance on
using the net asset value per share provided by the investee to measure the fair
value of an alternative investment. the provisions of the new standard were
adopted as of  september 28, 2009 and did not have a significant
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

the
provisions of the following new accounting standards will be adopted as of
january 1, 2010 and we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial statements:





●  


an
      amendment to the recognition and measurement guidance for the transfers of
      financial assets.

outlook

while our
revenues and income following the acquisition of wyeth will continue to be
tempered in the near term due to patent expirations and other factors, we will
continue to make the investments necessary to sustain long-term growth. we
remain confident that pfizer has the organizational strength and resilience, as
well as the strategies, financial depth and flexibility, to succeed in the long
term. however, no assurance can be given that the factors described above under
“our operating environment” or below under “forward-looking information and
factors that may affect future results” or other significant factors will not
have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
results.

on
october 20, 2009, we revised our guidance for 2009, at current exchange rates,
to reflect the acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009. this guidance
incorporates the projected impact of wyeth’s operations from the acquisition
closing date through pfizer’s international and domestic year-ends (see note (a)
to the table below).  in addition, our guidance reflects the projected
impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, increased pension expenses and
lower interest income compared to 2008. it also reflects an increase in the
effective tax rate associated with certain business decisions executed to
finance the wyeth acquisition. we revised our guidance for 2009 revenues to a
range of $49.0 billion to $50.0 billion from $45.0 billion to $46.0 billion, and
we increased our guidance for 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per common share
(eps) to a range of $2.00 to $2.05 from $1.90 to $2.00. we also increased our
guidance for 2009 reported diluted eps attributable to pfizer inc. common
shareholders to a range of $1.45 to $1.50 from $1.30 to $1.45.

on
january 26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new pfizer cost-reduction
initiative that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs
of approximately $3 billion, on a constant currency basis at 2008 exchange
rates, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total costs. we plan
to reinvest approximately $1 billion of these savings in the business, resulting
in an expected $2 billion net decrease by the end of 2011 compared to our 2008
adjusted total costs. for an understanding of adjusted income, see the “adjusted
income” section of this md&a.

as
referenced in this section, “current exchange rates” is defined as rates
approximating foreign currency spot rates in october 2009.

these and other factors, a reconciliation, at current exchange rates and
reflecting management’s current assessment, of 2009 adjusted income and adjusted
diluted eps guidance to 2009 reported net income attributable to pfizer inc. and

(a)  


the
      revised guidance in the table above includes projected results of
      operations for wyeth, in accordance with pfizer’s international and
      domestic year-ends. therefore, the guidance includes approximately
      one-and-a-half months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case
      of wyeth’s international operations and approximately two-and-a-half
      months of the fourth calendar quarter of 2009 in the case of wyeth’s u.s.
      operations. this guidance does not assume the completion of any other
      business-development transactions, including divestitures, not completed
      as of september 27, 2009, and excludes the potential effects of
      litigation-related matters not substantially resolved as of september 27,
      2009.








(b)  


includes
      estimated amounts that are dependent upon certain valuations and other
      studies of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from wyeth that
      have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient
      information for a definitive measurement.  accordingly, the
      estimated purchase accounting impacts are preliminary and may not be
      indicative of actual amounts that will be recorded as additional
      information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed.
      differences between the preliminary estimates reflected in this guidance
      and the final acquisition accounting will likely occur and could have a
      material impact on the guidance presented
above.








(c)  


includes
      restructuring and implementation costs incurred for pfizer legacy
      cost-reduction initiatives through the closing date of the wyeth
      acquisition. does not reflect an estimate for subsequent restructuring and
      implementation costs associated with pfizer legacy cost-reduction
      initiatives. the company will include an estimate for acquisition-related
      restructuring and integration costs in its full-year 2010 financial
      guidance in conjunction with its fourth-quarter 2009 earnings release in
      january 2010.








(d)  


includes
      certain costs incurred in connection with the wyeth acquisition from the
      announcement of the agreement to acquire wyeth on january 26, 2009 through
      the acquisition closing date including, but not limited to,
      pre-integration, transaction and financing costs. due to the recent timing
      of the acquisition closing, the guidance does not reflect an estimate for
      any restructuring or integration charges expected to be incurred in
      connection with the acquisition of wyeth. the company will include an
      estimate for acquisition-related restructuring and integration costs in
      its full-year 2010 financial guidance in conjunction with its
      fourth-quarter 2009 earnings release in january
  2010.

      this md&a.




our 2009
forecasted financial performance guidance is subject to a number of factors and
uncertainties, as described in the “forward-looking information and factors that
may affect future results” section of this md&a.

forward-looking information
and factors that may affect future results

the
securities and exchange commission (sec) encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. this report and other
written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain such
forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on
management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to
identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,”
“forecast,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any
discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans and
prospects. in particular,
these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and
prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or
results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest
rates, foreign exchange
rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial
results. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
are the following:

      publicly funded or subsidized health programs; the importation of
      prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by
      governments of various foreign countries; direct-to-consumer advertising
      and interactions with healthcare professionals; and the use of comparative
      effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that
      focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic

      protection, governmental investigations, ongoing efforts to explore
      various means for resolving asbestos litigation, and other legal
      proceedings;








●  


ability
      to protect our patents and other intellectual property both domestically

      earned outside of the u.s. that may result from pending and possible
      future proposals;








●  


changes
      in u.s. generally accepted accounting
  principles;








●  


uncertainties
      related to general economic, political, business, industry, regulatory and
      market conditions including, without limitation, uncertainties related to
      the impact on us, our lenders, our customers, our suppliers and
      counterparties to our foreign-exchange and interest-rate agreements of the
      global recession and recent and possible future changes in global
      financial markets;








●  


any
      changes in business, political and economic conditions due to actual or
      threatened terrorist activity in the u.s. and other parts of the world,

we cannot
guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we
believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of
anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and
inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results
could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or
projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking
statements.

we
undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised,
however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our
form 10-q, 8-k, and 10-k reports and our other filings with the securities and
exchange commission.

our form
10-k filing for the 2008 fiscal year listed various important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from projected and historic results.
we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that
filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that
form 10-k in this filing and investors should refer to it. you should understand
that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently,
you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential
risks or uncertainties.

this
report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various
in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of
a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates,
and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body
of data.

legal proceedings and
contingencies

we and
certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product liability,
consumer, commercial, securities, environmental and tax litigations and claims;
government investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to
time in the ordinary course of our business. we do not believe any of them will
have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

we record
accruals for income tax contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a tax
position is not sustainable under a “more likely than not” standard, and we
record our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that
could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction when
we conclude that the potential recovery is more likely than not. we record
accruals for all other contingencies to the extent that we conclude their
occurrence is probable and the related damages are estimable, and we record
anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when assured of
recovery. if a range of liability is probable and estimable and some amount
within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within
the range, we accrue that amount. if a range of liability is probable and
estimable and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than
any other amount within the range, we accrue the minimum of such probable range.
many claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, label warnings,
scientific evidence, actual damages and other matters. often these issues are
subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of loss and
an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. consequently, we cannot
reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss
in excess of amounts accrued for these contingencies. these assessments can
involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily
on estimates and assumptions. our assessments are based on estimates and
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. litigation is
inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. although we believe
we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incur
judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations in any particular period.

patent
claims include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on
various products or processes. although we believe we have substantial defenses
to these challenges with respect to all our material patents, there can be no
assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases
could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue, which could
lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect
future results of operations.
