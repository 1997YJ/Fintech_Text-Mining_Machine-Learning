in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the first quarter of 2018 spanned 13 weeks, whereas a

38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; product transitions; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended june 30,

2018 form 10-q | 29the company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. the u.s. internal revenue service (the “irs”) concluded its review of the years 2013 through 2015 during the third quarter of 2018. all years prior to 2016 are now closed. the company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. the company believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision ordered ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. the recovery amount was calculated to be €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also

incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (“asu 2016-02”), which

customers (topic 606) (“asu 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. asu 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an

status as directors or officers of the company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. while the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.note 1, “summary of significant accounting policies” in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k, and “critical accounting policies and estimates” in part ii, item 7 of the 2017 form 10-k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. with the exception of income taxes, there have been no material changes to the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 form 10-k.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the company’s deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the act, which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the act lowered the company’s u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. during the first quarter of 2018, the company’s income tax expense included a provisional estimate of $2.6 billion in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118. this $2.6 billion provisional estimate included $1.8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect the new lower tax rate, and approximately $800 million associated with the net impact of the deemed repatriation tax. during the third quarter of 2018, the company reduced its estimate of the deemed repatriation tax by $1.0 billion and adjusted the estimated impact of the deemed repatriation tax on unrecognized tax benefits by $700 million, resulting in the reduction of the company’s provisional estimate from $2.6 billion to $900 million. the impact of the adjustments to the provisional estimate for the deemed repatriation tax and unrecognized tax benefits was included in the company’s income tax expense during the third quarter of 2018. resolution of the provisional estimates of the act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.apple inc. | q3 2018 form 10-q | 34item 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

10-q | 22business seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the first quarter of 2018 spanned 13 weeks, whereas a 14th week was added to the first quarter of 2017,

38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; product transitions; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.operating expensesoperating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended june 30,

that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.on august

branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision ordered ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. the recovery amount was calculated to be €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes,

up to $4 billion of net deferred tax assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date, as well as the deferred tax impact of the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. the company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (“asu 2016-02”), which

accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.note 1, “summary of significant accounting policies” in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k, and “critical accounting

statements. with the exception of income taxes, there have been no material changes to the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 form 10-k.income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the company’s deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the act, which significantly

of $2.6 billion in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118. this $2.6 billion provisional estimate included $1.8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect the new lower tax rate, and approximately $800 million associated with the net impact of the deemed repatriation tax. during the third quarter of 2018, the company reduced its estimate of the deemed repatriation tax by $1.0 billion and adjusted the estimated impact of the deemed repatriation tax on unrecognized tax benefits by $700 million, resulting in the reduction of the company’s provisional estimate from $2.6 billion to $900 million. the impact of the adjustments to the provisional estimate for the deemed repatriation tax and unrecognized tax benefits was included in the company’s income tax expense during the third quarter of 2018. resolution of the provisional estimates of the act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.apple inc. | q3 2018 form 10-q | 34
