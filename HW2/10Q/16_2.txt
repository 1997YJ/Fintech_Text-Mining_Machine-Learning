billion ($1.90 per share — diluted), compared with $2.68 billion ($1.41 per share — diluted) in the first three months of 2017.upstream earnings in first quarter 2018 were $3.35 billion compared to $1.52 billion in the corresponding 2017 period. the increase was mainly due to higher realizations and production.downstream earnings in first quarter 2018 were $728 million compared with $926 million in the corresponding 2017 period. the decrease was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales, partially offset by lower tax expense, higher equity earnings from the 50 percent-owned chevron philips chemical company llc and favorable foreign currency effects.refer to pages 30 through 31 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for first quarter of 2018 versus the same period in 2017.business environment and outlookchevron corporation* is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, canada, china, colombia, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, nigeria, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, philippines, republic of congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, the united kingdom, the united states, and venezuela.earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014. the downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted the company's results of operations, cash flows, leverage, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. a sustained lower price environment could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods. the company has responded with reductions in operating expenses, pacing and re-focusing of capital and exploratory expenditures, and increased asset sales. the company anticipates that crude oil prices will _____________________* incorporated in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. in 2005, chevrontexaco corporation changed its name to chevron corporation. as used in this report, the term “chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we” , “us” and "its" may refer to chevron corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. all of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 26table of contentsincrease in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing or sustainability of any such increase is unknown. in the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. it is the company's objective to deliver competitive results and shareholder value in any business environment. the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. this is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. as a result, a decline or increase in the effective tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. note 11 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017.refer to the "cautionary statement relevant to forward-looking information" on page 2 and to "risk factors" on pages 19 through 22 of the company’s 2017 annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. the company's asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 is targeting before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses. the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) or other producers, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. cost pressures continue in the north america  unconventional market, particularly the permian basin, with increases in commodity prices and higher levels of activity and investment.  international and offshore markets are beginning to see indications of increased cost pressure. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.27table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $54 per barrel for the full-year 2017. during 2018, brent averaged $67 per barrel in the first quarter and ended april at about $75. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. brent markets traded in a $60 to $70 per barrel range throughout most of the first quarter 2018 due to steady demand growth, lower inventory levels, and strong compliance with opec production cuts implemented in january 2017. oil markets were also supported by heightened geopolitical uncertainty impacting key oil producing economies. the wti price averaged $51 per barrel for the full-year 2017. during 2018, wti averaged $63 per barrel in the first quarter and ended april at about $69. wti traded at a narrower discount to brent in the 2018 first quarter relative to fourth quarter 2017 due to declining u.s. inventory levels, higher exports and reduced supply bottlenecks.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high-gravity, low-sulfur crudes and low-gravity, high-sulfur crudes. the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supply/demand balances for each crude type. in first quarter 2018, the differential widened in north america due primarily to stronger north america light-sweet crude demand.  outside of north america, differentials narrowed as lower output from key producers continued to limit availability of heavier, more sour crudes.chevron has interests in the production of heavy crude oil in california, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 35 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil sales prices.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in north america. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $3.04 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the first three months of 2018, compared with $3.01 during the first three months of 2017. at the end of april 2018, the henry hub spot price was $2.68 per mcf. outside  the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations. in some locations, chevron has invested in long-term projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. the company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (lng) are typically linked to crude oil prices. most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market.  the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. international natural gas sales prices averaged $5.85 per mcf during the first three months of 2018, compared with $4.36 per mcf in the same period last year. (see page 35 for the company’s average natural gas sales prices for the u.s. and international regions.)the company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2018 averaged 2.852 million barrels per day. about one-sixth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2018 28table of contentsoccurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria and venezuela. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for the first quarter of 2018 or 2017. the company estimates that net oil-equivalent production for the full-year 2018 will grow 4 to 7 percent compared to 2017, assuming a brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of anticipated 2018 asset sales. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. net oil-equivalent production in the partitioned zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. during 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. as of early may 2018, production remained shut-in, and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between saudi arabia and kuwait. the financial effects from the loss of partitioned zone production have not been significant, and are not expected to be significant in 2018.in april 2018, the company sold its interest in the elk hills field in california, with proceeds to be reflected in second quarter results. refer to the “results of operations” section on page 30 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast and gulf coast of the united states, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. refer to the “results of operations” section on page 31 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.operating developmentsnoteworthy operating developments in recent months included the following:•united states — chevron phillips chemical company llc, the company’s 50 percent-owned affiliate, commenced operations of a new ethane cracker at its cedar bayou facility in baytown, texas.29table of contentsresults of operationsbusiness segments the following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments — upstream and downstream — as well as for “all other.” (refer to note 6, beginning on page 11, for a

earnings$648 $80u.s. upstream operations earned $648 million in first quarter 2018, compared to $80 million from the corresponding period in 2017. the improvement primarily reflected higher realizations and production of $430 and $180 million, respectively, partially offset by higher exploration expenses of $40 million.the company’s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $56 in first quarter 2018, up from $45 a year earlier. the average sales price of natural gas was $2.02 per thousand cubic feet in first quarter 2018, compared with $2.39 in first quarter 2017.net oil-equivalent production of 733,000 barrels per day in first quarter 2018 was up 61,000 barrels per day, or 9 percent, from a year earlier. production increases from shale and tight properties in the permian basin in texas and new mexico, and base business in the gulf of mexico, were partially offset by the impact of asset sales of 39,000 barrels per day and normal field declines. the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production in first quarter 2018 increased 13 percent to 567,000 barrels per day, while net natural gas production decreased 1 percent to 993 million cubic feet per day.  three months ended march 31 2018 2017 (millions of dollars)international upstream earnings*$2,704 $1,437___________________   *  includes foreign currency effects$120 $(274)international upstream operations earned $2.70 billion in first quarter 2018, compared with $1.44 billion from the corresponding period in 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas realizations of $710 million and $210 million, respectively, higher natural gas sales volumes of $410 million and lower tax items of $190 million. partially offsetting the increases were the absence of a gain of $600 million from the 2017 sale of the indonesia geothermal business and higher depreciation expenses mostly associated with higher production of $130 million. foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $394 million between periods.the average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in first quarter 2018 was $61, compared with $49 a year earlier. the average sales price of natural gas in first quarter 2018 was $5.85 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $4.36 in first quarter 2017. international net oil-equivalent production of 2.12 million barrels per day in first quarter 2018 increased 115,000 barrels per day, or 6 percent, from first quarter 2017. production increases from major capital projects, primarily gorgon and wheatstone in australia, were partially offset by production entitlement effects in several locations, normal field declines and the impact of asset sales of 22,000 barrels per day. the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 1.19 million barrels per day in first quarter 2018 decreased 1 percent from first quarter 2017. net natural gas production of

downstream earnings$442 $469u.s. downstream operations earned $442 million in first quarter 2018, compared with earnings of $469 million a year earlier. the decrease was primarily due to lower margins on refined product sales of $100 million and higher expenses from planned turnaround activity at the el segundo, california refinery of $80 million. these were partially offset by lower tax expenses of $70 million, and higher equity earnings from the 50 percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc of $60 million.refinery crude oil input in first quarter 2018 increased 2 percent to 930,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period. refined product sales of 1.19 million barrels per day increased 3 percent from first quarter 2017 primarily due to increased jet fuel sales. branded gasoline sales of 501,000 barrels per day decreased 2 percent from the 2017 period.  three months ended march 31 2018 2017 (millions of dollars)international downstream

31 2018 2017 (millions of dollars)income tax expense$1,414 $430the increase in income tax expense in 2018 of  $984 million is consistent with the increase in total income before tax for the company of $1.94 billion.u.s. income before tax increased from $237 million in 2017 to $862 million in 2018. this increase in income was primarily driven by the effect of higher crude oil prices and production. the increase in income had a direct impact on the company’s u.s. income tax cost which was partially offset by the lower u.s. statutory tax rate.   this resulted in an increase in tax expense of $609 million between year-over-year periods, from a tax benefit of $388 million in 2017 to a tax charge of $221 million in 2018.  contributing to the first quarter 2017 results were u.s. tax adjustments. 33table of contentsinternational income before tax increased from $2.89 billion in 2017 to $4.21 billion in 2018. this $1.32 billion increase was primarily driven by the effect of higher prices and production, offset by the absence of the gain on the 2017 sale of the company’s geothermal assets in indonesia. the higher prices and production primarily drove the $375 million increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $818 million in 2017 to $1.19 billion in 2018. refer also to the discussion of the effective income tax rate in note 11 on page

2018 and $4.8 billion at year-end 2017. cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of 2018 was $5.0 billion, compared with $3.8 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting higher prices and production, partially offset by higher working capital requirements in the current period. cash capital and exploratory expenditures totaled $3.1 billion in the first three months of 2018, down $0.3 billion from the year-ago period, reflecting lower activity. cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment of $0.1 billion in the first three months of 2018, compared to $1.8 billion in the year ago period.dividends the company paid dividends of $2.1 billion to common shareholders during the first three months of 2018. in april 2018, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per common share, payable in june 2018. debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $39.7 billion at march 31, 2018, up from $38.8 billion at december 31, 2017. the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the outstanding balance for the company's commercial paper program at march 31, 2018 was $8.6 billion. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $18.6 billion at march 31, 2018, and $15.2 billion at december 31, 2017. of these amounts, $10.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at both march 31, 2018, and december 31, 2017. at march 31, 2018, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at march 31, 2018, the company had $10.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. the credit facilities consist of a 364-day facility which enables borrowing of up to $9,575 million and allows the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, as well as a $425 million five-year facility expiring in december 2020. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on
