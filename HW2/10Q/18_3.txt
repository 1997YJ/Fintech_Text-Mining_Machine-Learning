(asml).•our business continues to generate healthy cash flow with $6.3 billion of cash from operations in q3 2017. during q3 2017, we purchased $3.0 billion in capital assets, paid $1.3 billion in dividends, and used $1.1 billion to repurchase 31 million shares of stock.four months ahead of our expectations, we completed our tender offer for the outstanding ordinary shares of mobileye b.v. (mobileye), a global leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. as a result of the completion, in q3 2017 we had acquisition-related impacts associated with this transaction, including inventory valuation adjustment of $27 million and other acquisition-related charges of $113 million.during the quarter, we launched our 8th generation intel® core™ processors, code named coffee lake, which delivered significant performance improvement to our client platforms. in addition, we are making great progress in artificial intelligence. for example, we launched the intel® movidius™ myriad™ x vision processing unit (vpu), the world's first vpu with a dedicated neural compute engine to deliver artificial intelligence capabilities to the edge in a low-power and high-performance package. * data-centric businesses consist of dcg, iotg, nsg, psg, and all other. ** adjacent businesses consist of our non-platform results.32intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)results of operations   three months ended nine months ended  q3 2017 q3 2016 ytd 2017 ytd 2016(dollars in millions, except per share amounts) dollars % of netrevenue dollars % of netrevenue dollars % of netrevenue dollars % of netrevenuenet revenue $16,149 100.0 % $15,778 100.0 % $45,708 100.0% $43,013 100.0 %cost of sales 6,092 37.7 % 5,795 36.7 % 17,406 38.1% 16,927 39.4 %gross margin 10,057 62.3 % 9,983 63.3 % 28,302 61.9% 26,086 60.6 %research and development 3,223 20.0 % 3,069 19.4 % 9,824 21.5% 9,460 22.0 %marketing, general and administrative 1,666 10.3 % 2,006 12.7 % 5,624 12.3% 6,239 14.5 %restructuring and other charges 4 — % 372 2.4 % 189 0.4% 1,786 4.1 %amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 49 0.3 % 74 0.5 % 124 0.3% 253 0.6 %operating income 5,115 31.7 % 4,462 28.3 % 12,541 27.4% 8,348 19.4 %gains (losses) on equity investments, net 846 5.2 % (12) (0.1)% 1,440 3.2% 488 1.1 %interest and other, net (31) (0.2)% (132) (0.8)% 336 0.7% (340) (0.7)%income before taxes 5,930 36.7 % 4,318 27.4 % 14,317 31.3% 8,496 19.8 %provision for taxes 1,414 8.7 % 940 6.0 % 4,029 8.8% 1,742 4.1 %net income $4,516 28.0 % $3,378 21.4 % $10,288 22.5% $6,754 15.7 %                 diluted earnings per common share $0.94   $0.69   $2.12   $1.39  net revenueour net revenue in q3 2017 increased by $371 million, or 2%, compared to q3 2016. the increase in revenue was driven by higher nsg revenue as well as dcg and iotg platform unit sales, which was partially offset by desktop platform unit sales. additionally, revenue was positively impacted by desktop and notebook platform average selling price increases due to mix of products which was partially offset by changes to the intel inside® program in q3 2017. we are implementing this change in an effort to make the program more efficient, effective and to provide more flexibility to our customers. this change to the intel inside® program impacts the way we classify our cooperative advertising costs and resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately $200 million with a corresponding reduction in marketing expenses. our net revenue for the first nine months of 2017 increased by $2.7 billion, or 6%, compared to the first nine months of 2016, which reflected an extra workweek. the higher revenue was driven by higher platform average selling prices, up 7%, primarily from notebook and dcg platforms. additionally, revenue increased due to higher notebook, dcg and iotg platform unit sales. revenue also increased from higher nsg and ccg modem revenue. the increase in revenue was offset by the q2 2017 divestiture of isecg and lower desktop platform unit sales.33intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)gross marginour overall gross margin percentage was 62.3% in q3 2017, down from 63.3% in q3 2016, and was 61.9% in the first nine months of 2017, up from 60.6% in the first nine months of 2016. our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2017 increased by $74 million, or 0.7%, compared to q3 2016, and in the in the first nine months of 2017 increased by $2.2 billion, or 8.5%, compared to the first nine months of 2016. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments.

preceding table. substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. this amount includes an increase of $5.0 billion in the authorization limit approved by our board of directors in april 2017. no commercial paper remained outstanding as of september 30, 2017. in q3 2017, we redeemed our $1.0 billion, 4.90% senior notes due august 2045 as well as issued a total of $640 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes to finance a portion of the senior notes redeemed.as of september 30, 2017, $10.0 billion of our $17.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $10.0 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $4.9 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of september 30, 2017. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.during q3 2017, we acquired 97.3% of mobileye's outstanding ordinary shares for $14.5 billion net cash. we funded the acquisition, and expect to fund the remaining portion, with cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries.   during q2 2017, we completed the divestiture of our isecg business for total consideration of $4.2 billion. the consideration included cash proceeds of $924 million and $2.2 billion in the form of promissory notes. during q3 2017, mcafee and tpg repaid the $2.2 billion of promissory notes and mcafee paid us a $735 million dividend.  we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.40intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)in
