effects$580 $(79)(2) income net of tax; also referred to as “earnings” in the discussions that follow.   net income attributable to chevron corporation for the first three months of 2015 was $2.6 billion ($1.37 per share — diluted), versus $4.5 billion ($2.36 per share — diluted) in the first three months of 2014.upstream earnings in first quarter 2015 were $1.6 billion compared with $4.3 billion a year earlier. the decrease between comparative periods was mainly due to lower crude oil realizations and higher depreciation expenses, partially offset by higher crude oil production, lower tax and operating expenses, higher gains on asset sales and favorable foreign currency effects.downstream earnings in first quarter 2015 were $1.4 billion compared with $710 million in the corresponding 2014 period. higher margins on refined product sales, both internationally and in the u.s., drove the increase.  partially offsetting the increase was the absence of a 2014 asset sale gain and lower affiliate earnings in the u.s., and an unfavorable change in effects on derivative instruments internationally.refer to pages 28 through 30 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for first quarter of 2015 versus the same period in 2014.business environment and outlookchevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, canada, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, nigeria, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela, and vietnam.earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014, reflecting robust non-opec supply growth led by expanding unconventional production in the united states, weakening growth in emerging markets, and the decision by opec in fourth quarter 2014 to maintain its current production ceiling. the downturn in the price of crude oil  24table of contentshas impacted, and, depending upon its duration, will continue to significantly impact the company's results of operations, cash flows, leverage, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. if lower prices persist for an extended period of time, the company's response could include further reductions in operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures and additional asset sales. the company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing of any such increases is unknown. in the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. refer to the "cautionary statement relevant to forward-looking information" on page 2 and to "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, on pages 22 through 24 of the company’s 2014 annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. refer to the "results of operations" section, beginning on page 28 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2015. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. in recent years, chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. as a result of the decline in prices of crude oil and other commodities since mid-2014, these cost pressures are beginning to soften. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.25table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $99 per barrel for the full-year 2014. during 2015, brent averaged $54 per barrel in the first quarter, and ended april at $64. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. after falling sharply over the second-half of 2014 due to growing market over supply, prices stabilized over the first quarter of 2015 as oil and gas capital budgets were cut and drilling rig counts fell globally. however, the anticipated improvement in global supply/demand balances continues to be offset by concerns over growing crude inventories globally, and in the u.s. in particular. first quarter 2015 brent-related crude prices in the atlantic basin also reflect high refinery maintenance in north america, higher production from iraq, and easing geopolitical tensions in key regions. the wti price averaged $93 per barrel for the full-year 2014. during 2015, wti averaged $49 per barrel in the first quarter, and ended april at $60. wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2014 and the first three months of 2015 due to high inventories and excess crude supply in the u.s. market. a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supply/demand balances for each crude type, which are functions of the capacity of refineries that are able to process each as feedstock into high-value light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). in first quarter 2015, the differential eased in north america as light sweet crude oil production in the u.s. midcontinent region remained robust, while refinery maintenance dampened demand. outside of north america, supply disruptions in libya and high refinery runs in europe supported light sweet crude markets relative to heavier, more sour crudes.chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 32 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. in the u.s., prices at henry hub averaged $2.87 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the first three months of 2015, compared with $5.11 during the first three months of 2014. at the end of april 2015, the henry hub spot price was $2.57 per mcf. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. the company's contract prices for liquefied natural gas (lng) are typically linked to crude oil prices. international natural gas realizations averaged $5.01 per mcf during the first three months of 2015, compared with $6.02 per mcf in the same period last year. (see page 32 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)the company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2015 averaged 2.681 million barrels per day. about one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2015 26table of contentsoccurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for first quarter 2015 or 2014. at their november 2014 meeting, members of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day, which has been in effect since december 2008.the company estimates that net oil-equivalent production for the full-year 2015 will be flat to 3 percent growth compared to 2014. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by opec; price and other production entitlement effects; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the united states. in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the risk that the company’s future production could be negatively impacted by continued difficulties in securing work and equipment permits has increased. net oil-equivalent production in the partitioned zone in first quarter 2015 was 76,000 barrels per day. the potential for a complete loss of production in the partitioned zone was not anticipated in the company’s 2015 full-year production guidance. the potential for a complete loss of production is uncertain, and if it does occur, the company cannot estimate its duration. if a complete loss of production occurs, the financial effects in 2015 are expected to be minimal. refer to the “results of operations” section on page 28 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas.the company completed the sale of its interest in caltex australia limited as part of its previously-announced asset sales commitment. cash proceeds of $3.6 billion were received upon settlement on april 2 and a gain on sale of $1.6 billion will be reflected in second quarter results.refer to the “results of operations” section on page 29 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.27table of contentsoperating developmentsnoteworthy operating developments for the upstream business in recent months included the following:•australia — achieved introduction of fuel gas and start-up of the first gas turbine generator at the gorgon lng plant.•australia — completed installation of wheatstone platform topsides.•australia — announced a natural gas discovery, isosceles-1, in the carnarvon basin in 50 percent-owned block wa-392-p. •bangladesh — achieved first liquids from the bibiyana expansion liquid recovery unit.•united states — announced a joint venture to explore and appraise 24 jointly held offshore leases in the northwest portion of keathley canyon in the deepwater gulf of mexico.•united states — ramped up oil-equivalent production at jack/st. malo in the deepwater gulf of mexico to more than 70,000 barrels per day. results of operationsbusiness segments the following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments — upstream and downstream — as well as for “all other.” (refer to note 7, on page 10, for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments,” as defined under the accounting standards for segment reporting.)upstream three months ended march 31 2015 2014 (millions of dollars)     u.s. upstream earnings$(460) $912u.s. upstream operations incurred a loss of $460 million in first quarter 2015 compared to earnings of $912 million from a year earlier, largely due to sharply lower crude oil realizations of $1.4 billion. higher depreciation expenses of $250 million, in part due to impairments, and lower natural gas realizations of $180 million, were largely offset by higher crude oil production and lower operating expenses of $270 million and $120 million, respectively.the company’s average realization per barrel for u.s. crude oil and natural gas liquids in first quarter 2015 was $43, compared to $91 a year earlier. the average natural gas realization in first quarter 2015 was $2.27 per thousand cubic feet and $4.77 in last year's first quarter.net oil-equivalent production of 699,000 barrels per day in first quarter 2015 was up 59,000 barrels per day, or 9 percent, from the first quarter a year earlier. production increased due to project ramp-ups in the gulf of mexico, the permian basin in texas and new mexico, and the marcellus shale in western pennsylvania.the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 489,000 barrels per day in the first quarter increased 12 percent from the corresponding 2014 period. net natural gas production was 1.26 billion cubic feet per day in first quarter 2015, an increase of 4 percent from the comparative 2014 period.28table of contents three months ended march 31 2015 2014 (millions of

billion from first quarter 2014. sharply lower crude oil realizations of $2.8 billion were partially offset by lower tax items, including a reduction in statutory tax rates in the united kingdom, higher gains on asset sales and lower operating expenses of $390 million, $310 million and $120 million, respectively. foreign currency effects increased earnings by $522 million in the 2015 quarter,

marketable securities totaled $13.1 billion at march 31, 2015, down $0.1 billion from year-end 2014. cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of 2015 was $2.3 billion, compared with $8.4 billion in the year-ago period. cash capital and exploratory expenditures decreased $966 million between periods, reflecting the pacing of certain of the company's larger capital projects. dividends the company paid dividends of $2.0 billion to common shareholders during the first three months of 2015. in april 2015, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.07 per common share, payable in june 2015. debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $33.9 billion at march 31, 2015, up from $27.8 billion at december 31, 2014. the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the authorized borrowing limit under this program is $20.0 billion and the outstanding balance at march 31, 2015, was $8.6 billion. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $11.9 billion at march 31, 2015, and $11.8 billion at december 31, 2014. of these amounts, $8.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at both march 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014. at march 31, 2015, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at march 31, 2015, the company had $8.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in december 2016, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at march 31, 2015. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in november 2015 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poor’s corporation and aa1 by moody’s investors service. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. the company also can modify capital spending plans during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the company’s high-quality debt ratings.common share repurchase program in july 2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. from the inception of the program through 2014, the company purchased 180.9 million shares for $20.0 billion. the company does not plan to acquire any shares under the program in 2015.noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion at march 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014, respectively. there were no distributions to noncontrolling interests during the first three months of 2015 or for the same period in 2014.current ratio — current assets divided by
