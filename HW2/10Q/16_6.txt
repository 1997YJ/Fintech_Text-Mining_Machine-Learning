billion ($0.68 per share — diluted), compared with earnings of $2.04 billion ($1.09 per share — diluted) in the corresponding 2015 period. the net loss attributable to chevron corporation for the first nine months of 2016 was $912 million ($0.49 per share — diluted), compared with earnings of $5.18 billion ($2.76 per share — diluted) in the first nine months of 2015.upstream earnings in third quarter 2016 were $454 million compared with $59 million a year earlier. the improvement was mainly due to lower tax items, operating expenses and depreciation expenses, partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas realizations. the loss for the first nine months of 2016 was $3.47 billion compared with a loss of $600 million a year earlier. the decrease was due to lower crude oil and natural gas realizations and lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower operating, exploration and depreciation expenses. in addition, both comparative periods were impacted by an unfavorable change in foreign currency effects.downstream earnings in third quarter 2016 were $1.07 billion compared with $2.21 billion in the corresponding 2015 period. the decrease was due to lower margins on refined product sales, the absence of third quarter 2015 gains on derivative instruments and lower earnings from the 50 percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc. partially offsetting the decrease were lower operating expenses. earnings for the first nine months of 2016 were $3.08 billion compared with $6.59 billion in the corresponding 2015 period. the decrease in the nine-month period was due to lower margins on refined product sales, lower gains on asset sales, lower earnings from the 50 percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc and an unfavorable change in effects on derivative instruments. partially offsetting the decrease were lower operating expenses. in addition, both comparative periods were impacted by an unfavorable change in foreign currency effects.refer to pages 28 through 31 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for third quarter and first nine months of 2016 versus the same period in 2015.24table of contentsbusiness environment and outlookchevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, canada, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, nigeria, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, philippines, republic of congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, and venezuela.earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014, reflecting persistently high global crude oil inventories and production. the downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted and, depending upon its duration, will continue to significantly impact the company's results of operations, cash flows, leverage, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. a sustained lower price environment was a factor in certain impairments in second quarter 2016, and could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods. the company is responding with reductions in operating expenses, including employee reductions, reductions in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2016 and future periods, and increased asset sales. the company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing of any such increase is unknown. in the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. refer to the "cautionary statement relevant to forward-looking information" on page 2 and to "risk factors" on pages 21 through 23 of the company’s 2015 annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. refer to the "results of operations" section beginning on page 28 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2016. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. in recent years, chevron and the oil and gas industry generally experienced an increase in certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. as a result of the decline in prices of crude oil and other commodities since mid-2014, these costs have declined. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.25table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $52 per barrel for the full-year 2015. during 2016, brent averaged $46 per barrel in the third quarter, $42 per barrel for the nine-month period, and ended october at about $47. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. prices slipped early in the third quarter amid concerns about the global inventory overhang and growing surplus, but firmed through august and september 2016 as opec and non-opec producers considered production cuts and disruptions in nigeria peaked. however, upside price movement remained constrained as a result of ongoing growth in opec production from iran, saudi arabia, and iraq, increasing russian supplies, and lingering concerns over persistently high crude and product inventories globally. the wti price averaged $49 per barrel for the full-year 2015. during 2016, wti averaged $45 per barrel in the third quarter, $41 per barrel for the nine-month period, and ended october at about $47. wti values traded at a discount to brent throughout much of the third quarter of 2016. strong refinery runs, easing inventories, and rising imports into the u.s. pressured wti pricing, while brent was supported by growing optimism that opec action was becoming more likely. however, brent upside was limited by intermittent inventory overhang of west africa and north sea crudes and easing refinery runs in europe.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supply/demand balances for each crude type, which are functions of the capacity of refineries that are able to process each as feedstock into high-value light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). in the third quarter of 2016, the differential contracted in north america as gains in heavy crude values resulted from strong demand from high-conversion refineries, while support for light sweet crude oil pricing was less robust amid rising rig counts and expectations of slowing u.s. production declines. outside of north america, differentials were steady to slightly contracted as subdued refinery maintenance in europe dampened demand for light sweet crude in the atlantic basin, while rising output from iran and other middle east producers continued to pressure heavier, more sour crudes.chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 33 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $2.29 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the first nine months of 2016, compared with $2.80 during the first nine months of 2015. at the end of october 2016, the henry hub spot price was $2.80 per mcf. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. the company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (lng) are typically linked to crude oil prices. approximately 85 percent of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is targeted to be sold into binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot 26table of contentslng market. the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. international natural gas realizations averaged $4.01 per mcf during the first nine months of 2016, compared with $4.73 per mcf in the same period last year. (see page 33 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)the company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2016 averaged 2.569 million barrels per day. about one-fourth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2016 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, indonesia, nigeria and venezuela. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for the third quarter of 2016 or 2015. the company estimates that net oil-equivalent production for the full-year 2016 will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. estimated full-year production has been unfavorably impacted by the continued shut-in of production in the partitioned zone, start-up issues at the gorgon project and the effect of other external events. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including the duration of the low price environment that began in second-half 2014; quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the united states. in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. net oil-equivalent production in the partitioned zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. during 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. as of early november 2016, production remained shut-in, and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between saudi arabia and kuwait. the financial effects from the loss of production in 2015 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2016.refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 28 and 29 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 29 and 30 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities,

$45.6 billion at september 30, 2016, up from $38.5 billion at december 31, 2015. the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the outstanding

paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $14.1 billion at september 30, 2016, and $12.9 billion at december 31, 2015. of these amounts, $8.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at both september 30, 2016, and december 31, 2015. at september 30, 2016, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at september 30, 2016, the company had $8.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. the credit facilities consist of a 364-day facility which enables borrowing of up to $6.0 billion and can be renewed for an additional 364-day period or the company can convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, and a $2.0 billion five-year facility expiring in december 2020. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit

guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa- by standard and poor’s corporation and aa2 by moody’s investors service. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.common share repurchase program in july 2010, the board of directors
