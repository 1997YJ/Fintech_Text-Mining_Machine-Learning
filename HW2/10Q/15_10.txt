environment, strategy and outlookour businesswe apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies (alliance revenues).the financial information included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the u.s. is as of and for the three and six months ended may 24, 2015 and may 25, 2014.on february 5, 2015, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we agreed to acquire hospira, inc. (hospira), the world’s leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies and a global leader in biosimilars, for $90 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $17 billion. we expect to finance the transaction through a combination of existing cash and new debt, with approximately two-thirds of the value financed from cash and one-third from debt. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions, and is expected to close in the second half of 2015. on may 13, 2015, hospira shareholders voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which was also a condition to closing the transaction. on august 4, 2015, the european commission approved the transaction under the european union (eu) merger regulation. the european commission’s decision includes our commitment to divest certain assets in the eu. we expect to generate $800 million of annual synergies by 2018 in connection with the hospira acquisition. based on our past experience, the one-time costs to generate the synergies are expected to be approximately $1 billion, incurred for up to a three-year period post-acquisition.our 2015 performancerevenues––second quarter 2015 revenues in the second quarter of 2015 were $11.9 billion, a decrease of 7% compared to the same period in 2014, which reflects an operational increase of $125 million, or 1%, more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.0 billion, or 8%. the operational increase was primarily the result of:•the performance of several key products in developed markets, including prevnar 13 primarily in adults (primarily in the u.s.), eliquis, lyrica (gip) (primarily in the u.s. and japan), xeljanz (primarily in the u.s), viagra (gip) and ibrance (in the u.s.), as well as from vaccines acquired in december 2014 from baxter international inc. (baxter) (collectively, up approximately $950 million); and•a 6% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets, reflecting continued strong operational growth primarily from lipitor and prevenar 13 (collectively, up approximately $135 million),partially offset by:•the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for celebrex in the u.s. in december 2014 (down approximately $460 million);•the loss of exclusivity for zyvox in the u.s. in the first half of 2015, lyrica (gep) in certain developed europe markets, beginning in the first quarter of 2015, celebrex in canada, developed europe, australia and new zealand, rapamune in the u.s., inspra in developed europe, and viagra (gep) (international developed markets) (collectively, down approximately $290 million) and the loss of exclusivity for certain other products (collectively, down approximately $60 million); •the performance of certain other products such as lipitor in developed markets and nexium 24hr and geodon in the u.s. (collectively, down approximately $170 million); and•the termination of the spiriva co-promotion collaboration in certain countries (down approximately $30 million).revenues––first six months 2015revenues in the first six months of 2015 were $22.7 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the same period in 2014, which reflects an operational increase of $375 million or 2%, more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.8 billion, or 7%. the operational increase was primarily the result of:40•the performance of several key products in developed markets, including prevnar 13 primarily in adults (primarily in the u.s.), eliquis, lyrica (gip) (primarily in the u.s. and japan), xeljanz (primarily in the u.s.), viagra (gip) and ibrance (in the u.s.), as well as from vaccines acquired in december 2014 from baxter (collectively, up approximately $1.7 billion); and•a 9% operational increase in revenues in emerging markets, reflecting continued strong operational growth, primarily from lipitor, prevenar 13, zyvox and viagra (in china) (collectively, up approximately $320 million),partially offset by:•the loss of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for celebrex in the u.s. in december 2014 (down approximately $840 million);•the loss of exclusivity for zyvox in the u.s. in the first half of 2015, lyrica (gep) in certain developed europe markets beginning in the first quarter of 2015, celebrex in canada, developed europe, australia and new zealand, rapamune in the u.s., inspra in developed europe, viagra (gep) (international developed markets) and aricept in canada (collectively, down approximately $490 million), and the loss of exclusivity for certain other products (collectively, down approximately $80 million); •the performance of certain other products such as lipitor in developed markets, benefix and geodon in the u.s., and norvasc in japan (collectively, down approximately $260 million); and•the termination of the spiriva co-promotion collaboration in certain countries (down approximately $100 million).income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 was $2.6 billion, compared to $2.9 billion in the second quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting, among other items, in addition to the operational and foreign exchange impacts for revenues described above:•higher legal charges (up $101 million) (see also the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net),partially offset by:•lower cost of sales (down $282 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––cost of sales” section of this md&a);•lower amortization of intangible assets (down $129 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––amortization of intangible assets ” section of this md&a);•a lower effective tax rate (down 1.5 percentage points to 25.6%) (see also the “provision for taxes on income” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 5. tax matters);•lower selling, informational and administrative expenses (down $134 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––selling, informational and administrative expenses (si&a) expenses” section of this md&a); and•lower net interest expense (down $80 million) (see also the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net). income from continuing operations for the first six months of 2015 was $5.0 billion, compared to $5.2 billion in the first six months of 2014, primarily reflecting, among other items, in addition to the operational and foreign exchange impacts for revenues described above:•higher research and development expenses (up $238 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––research and development (r&d) expenses” section of this md&a); and•higher charges for business and legal entity alignment activities (up $97 million) (see also the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net), partially offset by:•lower legal charges (down $593 million) (see also the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net);•lower cost of sales (down $489 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––cost of sales” section of this md&a);•lower amortization of intangible assets (down $307 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––amortization of intangible assets” section of this md&a);•lower net interest expense (down $93 million) (see also the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net);41•lower asset impairments (down $90 million) (see also the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net); and•lower selling, informational and administrative expenses (down $69 million) (see also the “costs and expenses––selling, information and administrative expenses (si&a) expenses” section of this md&a).our operating environmentindustry-specific challengesthe majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in our 2014 annual report on form 10-k, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and highly regulated. as a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. these factors include, among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, healthcare legislation, pipeline productivity, the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition among branded products. we also face challenges as a result of the global economic environment. for additional information about these factors and challenges, see “the global economic environment” section of this md&a.intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rightsthe loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. we have lost exclusivity for a number of our products in certain markets and we have lost collaboration rights with respect to a number of our alliance products in certain markets, and we expect certain products and alliance products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years.see the “intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rights” section of our 2014 financial report for information about (i) recent losses and expected losses of product exclusivity impacting product revenues and (ii) recent and expected losses of collaboration rights impacting alliance revenues. we expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years. for additional information, see the “patents and other intellectual property rights” section in part i, item 1, “business”, of our 2014 annual report on form 10-k.we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights whenever we deem appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues––major biopharmaceutical products” and “revenues––selected product descriptions” sections of this md&a. for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation.regulatory environment/pricing and access––u.s. healthcare legislationin march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (together, the u.s. healthcare legislation, and also known as the affordable care act, or aca), was enacted in the u.s. for additional information, see the “government regulation and price constraints” section in part i, item 1, “business”, of our 2014 annual report on form 10-k. we recorded the following amounts as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation:•$203 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $30 million in the second quarter of 2014, and $437 million in the first six months of 2015 and $205 million in the first six months of 2014, recorded as a reduction to revenues, related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •$56 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $54 million in the second quarter of 2014, and $89 million in the first six months of 2015 and $25 million in the first six months of 2014, recorded in selling, informational and administrative expenses, related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for u.s. income tax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs. the increase in the first six months of 2015 was primarily a result of a decrease in the favorable true-up in the first six months of 2015, compared to the favorable true-up in the first six months of 2014, associated with the final invoice for the respective prior-calendar year received from the federal government, which reflected a lower share than that of the initial invoice.42regulatory environment/pricing and access––government and other payer group pressuresgovernments, managed care organizations and other payer groups continue to seek increasing discounts on our products through a variety of means, such as leveraging their purchasing power, implementing price controls, and demanding price cuts (directly or by rebate actions). in europe, japan, china, canada, south korea and some other international markets, governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. in the u.s., a primary government activity with implications for pricing is deficit reduction. any significant spending reductions affecting medicare, medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broad deficit-reduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.the aca, which expanded the role of the u.s. government as a healthcare payer, is accelerating changes in the u.s. healthcare marketplace, and the potential for additional pricing and access pressures continues to be significant. many of these developments may impact drug utilization, in particular branded drug utilization. some employers, seeking to avoid the tax on high-cost health insurance in the aca to be imposed in 2018, are already scaling back healthcare benefits. some health plans and pharmacy benefit managers are seeking greater pricing predictability from pharmaceutical manufacturers in contractual negotiations. other health plans and pharmacy benefit managers are increasing their focus on spending on specialty medicines by implementing co-insurance in place of a flat co-payment. because co-insurance passes on a percentage of a drug’s cost to the patient, this shift has the potential to significantly increase patient out-of-pocket costs.overall, there is increasing pressure on u.s. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions. these new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. at the same time, these models can also expand utilization by encouraging physicians to screen, diagnose and focus on outcomes. in response to the evolving u.s. and global healthcare spending landscape, we are continuing to work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major u.s. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products. further, we are seeking to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs. the global economic environmentin addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, are exposed to the economic cycle, which impacts our biopharmaceutical operations globally. •we believe that patients, who are experiencing increases in co-pays and restrictions on access to medicines as payers seek to control costs, sometimes switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. we are exposed to negative pricing pressure in various markets around the world. the u.s. has highly competitive insurance markets, and europe, japan, china, canada, south korea and a number of other international markets have government-mandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global pressures. furthermore, some government agencies and third-party payers use health technology assessments in ways that, at times, lead to restricted access to and lower prices for new medicines.•we continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets, including greece, where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. for further information about our accounts receivable, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.•significant portions of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen, the chinese renminbi, the u.k. pound, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. conversely, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having 43a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including venezuela, can impact our results and financial guidance. for further information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a. despite the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service (moody’s). as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial condition, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2014 annual report on form 10-k.our strategywe believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. we continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. we continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to patients and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. we remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that significantly improve their lives. by doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders. commercial operationswe manage our commercial operations through two distinct businesses: an innovative products business and an established products business. the innovative products business is composed of two operating segments, each of which is led by a single manager––the global innovative pharmaceutical segment (gip) and the global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare segment (voc). the established products business consists of the global established pharmaceutical segment (gep), which is led by a single manager. each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain in-process research and development (ipr&d) projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof of concept. each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. some additional information about each product grouping follows:•global innovative pharmaceutical segment––gip is focused on developing, registering and commercializing novel, value-creating medicines that significantly improve patients’ lives. these therapeutic areas include inflammation, cardiovascular/metabolic, neuroscience and pain, rare diseases and women’s/men’s health and include leading brands, such as xeljanz, eliquis and lyrica (u.s. and japan). gip has a pipeline of medicines in inflammation, cardiovascular/metabolic disease, neuroscience and pain, and rare diseases. •global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare segment––voc focuses on the development and commercialization of vaccines and products for oncology and consumer healthcare. consumer healthcare manufactures and markets several well known, over-the-counter (otc) products. each of the three businesses in voc operates as a separate, global business with distinct specialization in terms of the science and market approach necessary to deliver value to consumers and patients. •global established pharmaceutical segment––gep includes the brands that have lost market exclusivity and, generally, the mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 in most major markets and, to a much smaller extent, generic pharmaceuticals. additionally, gep includes our development portfolio of sterile injectable and biosimilar products.44we expect that the gip and voc biopharmaceutical portfolios of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line products will be sustained by ongoing investments to develop promising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to ensure a pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need. the assets managed by these groups are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers.gep is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. gep leverages our biologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. we may also engage in targeted business development to further enable our commercial strategies.for additional information about our operating structure, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 13a. segment, geographic and other revenue information: segment information.for additional information about the 2015 performance for each of our operating segments, see the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a.research operationswe continue to strengthen our global r&d organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules––immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. another area of focus is biosimilars. while a significant portion of r&d is done internally, we continue to seek to enhance our pipeline of potential future products by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity-based investments. these agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. collaboration, alliance and license agreements, as well as equity-based investments, allow us to share risk and cost, to access external scientific and technological expertise, and enable us to advance our own products as well as in-licensed or acquired products.for additional information about r&d by operating segment, see the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a. for additional information about our pending new drug applications and supplemental filings, see the “analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of income––product developments––biopharmaceutical” section of this md&a. for additional information about recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe have the potential to advance our pipeline and maximize the value of our in-line products, see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.intellectual property rightswe continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. in addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches designed to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity. for additional information about our current efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights, see notes to

commitments and contingencies.our business development initiativeswe are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. we are especially interested in opportunities in our high-priority therapeutic areas––immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases––and in emerging markets and established products, including biosimilars. we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities for our businesses. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2. acquisition,

total consideration of approximately $130 million (€115 million). this transaction will add two high-quality and complementary vaccines to our portfolio, allowing us to reach a broader global population. we do not expect this transaction to have any significant impact on our 2015 financial performance. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions as well as regulatory approvals in several markets, and is expected to close in the second half of 2015. •acquisition of a minority interest in am-pharma b.v. (am-pharma)––on april 9, 2015, we acquired a minority equity interest in am-pharma, a privately held dutch biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of recombinant human alkaline phosphatase (recap) for inflammatory diseases, and secured an exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity in the company. the option becomes exercisable upon delivery of the clinical trial report after completion of a phase ii trial of recap in the treatment of acute kidney injury related to sepsis. results from the current phase ii trial for recap are expected in the second half of 2016. under the terms of the agreement, we paid $87.5 million for both the exclusive option and the minority equity interest, which was recorded as a cost-method investment in long-term investments, and we may make additional payments of up to $512.5 million upon exercise of the option and potential launch of any product that may result from this investment.•agreement to acquire hospira, inc. (hospira)––on february 5, 2015, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we agreed to acquire hospira, the world’s leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies and a global leader in biosimilars, for $90 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $17 billion. we expect to finance the transaction through a combination of existing cash and new debt, with approximately two-thirds of the value financed from cash and one-third from debt. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions, and is expected to close in the second half of 2015. on may 13, 2015, hospira shareholders voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which was also a condition to closing the transaction. on august 4, 2015, the european commission approved the transaction under the eu merger regulation. the european commission’s decision includes our commitment to divest certain assets in the eu. •collaboration with opko health, inc. (opko)––on december 13, 2014, we entered into a collaborative agreement with opko to develop and commercialize opko’s long-acting human growth hormone (hgh-ctp) for the treatment of growth 46hormone deficiency (ghd) in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born small for gestational age (sga) who fail to show catch-up growth by two years of age. hgh-ctp has the potential to reduce the required dosing frequency of human growth hormone to a single weekly injection from the current standard of one injection per day. we have received the exclusive license to commercialize hgh-ctp worldwide. opko will lead the clinical activities and will be responsible for funding the development programs for the key indications, which include adult and pediatric ghd and pediatric sga. we will be responsible for all development costs for additional indications, all postmarketing studies, manufacturing and commercialization activities for all indications, and we will lead the manufacturing activities related to product development. the transaction closed on january 28, 2015, upon termination of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino act. in february 2015, we made an upfront payment of $295 million to opko, which was recorded in research and development expenses, and opko is eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. opko is also eligible to receive royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hgh-ctp for adult ghd, which is subject to regulatory approval. upon the launch of hgh-ctp for pediatric ghd, which is subject to regulatory approval, the royalties will transition to tiered gross profit sharing for both hgh-ctp and our product, genotropin.•acquisition of marketed vaccines business of baxter international inc. (baxter)––on december 1, 2014 (which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 for our international operations), we completed the acquisition of baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines for a final purchase price of $648 million. the portfolio that was acquired consists of neisvac-c and fsme-immun/ticovac. neisvac-c is a vaccine that helps protect against meningitis caused by group c meningococcal meningitis and fsme-immun/ticovac is a vaccine that helps protect against tick-borne encephalitis.•collaboration with merck kgaa––on november 17, 2014, we entered into a collaborative agreement with merck kgaa, to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, an investigational anti-pd-l1 antibody currently in development as a potential treatment for multiple types of cancer. we and merck kgaa are exploring the therapeutic potential of this novel anti-pd-l1 antibody as a single agent as well as in various combinations with our and merck kgaa’s broad portfolio of approved and investigational oncology therapies. the companies will collaborate on up to 20 high priority immuno-oncology clinical development programs, including combination trials, in 2015. these clinical development programs include up to six trials (phase 2 or 3) that could be pivotal for potential product registrations. we and merck kgaa are also combining resources and expertise to advance pfizer’s anti-pd-1 antibody into phase 1 trials. under the terms of the agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we made an upfront payment of $850 million to merck kgaa and merck kgaa is eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to approximately $2.0 billion. both companies will jointly fund all development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any anti-pd-l1 or anti-pd-1 products from this collaboration. also, as part of the agreement, we gave merck kgaa certain co-promotion rights for xalkori in the u.s. and several other key markets. in 2014, we recorded $1.2 billion of research and development expenses associated with this collaborative arrangement, composed of the $850 million upfront cash payment as well as an additional amount of $309 million, reflecting the estimated fair value of the co-promotion rights given to merck kgaa. •acquisition of innopharma, inc. (innopharma)––on september 24, 2014, we completed our acquisition of innopharma, a privately held pharmaceutical development company, for an upfront cash payment of $225 million and contingent milestone payments of up to $135 million.•license from cellectis sa (cellectis)––on june 18, 2014, we entered into a global arrangement with cellectis to develop chimeric antigen receptor t-cell immunotherapies in the field of oncology directed at select cellular surface antigen targets. in august 2014, we made an upfront payment of $80 million to cellectis, which was recorded in research and development expenses. we will also fund r&d costs associated with 15 pfizer-selected targets and, for the benefit of cellectis, a portion of the r&d costs associated with four cellectis-selected targets within the arrangement. cellectis is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per product that results from the pfizer-selected targets. cellectis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of any products that are commercialized by pfizer.•collaboration with eli lilly & company (lilly)––in october 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize pfizer’s tanezumab, which provides that pfizer and lilly will equally share product-development expenses as well as potential revenues and certain product-related costs. on march 23, 2015, pfizer and lilly announced that the companies are preparing to resume the phase 3 clinical program for tanezumab. as a result, on march 27, 2015, we received a $200 million upfront payment from lilly in accordance with the collaboration agreement between pfizer and lilly, which is recorded as deferred income in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and is being recognized into other (income)/deductions––net over a multi-year period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. this announcement followed a decision by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) to lift the partial clinical hold on the tanezumab development program after a review of nonclinical data characterizing the sympathetic nervous system response 47to tanezumab. under the collaboration agreement with lilly, we are eligible to receive additional payments from lilly upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones.•license of nexium otc rights––in august 2012, we entered into an agreement with astrazeneca plc (astrazeneca) for the exclusive, global, otc rights for nexium, a leading prescription drug approved to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. in connection with this consumer healthcare licensing agreement, we made an upfront payment of $250 million to astrazeneca, which was recorded in research and development expenses in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2012. on may 27, 2014, we launched nexium 24hr in the u.s., and on july 11, 2014, we paid astrazeneca a related $200 million product launch milestone payment; and on august 1, 2014, we launched nexium control in europe, and on september 15, 2014, we paid astrazeneca a related $50 million product launch milestone payment. these post-approval milestone payments were recorded in identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization in the consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized over the estimated useful life of the nexium brand. astrazeneca is eligible to receive additional milestone payments of up to $300 million, based on the level of worldwide sales as well as royalty payments, based on worldwide sales.for a description of the more significant recent transactions through february 27, 2015, the filing date of our 2014 annual report on form 10-k, see

one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions. our 2015 financial guidance does not reflect any impact from our pending acquisition of hospira, which is expected to close during the second half of 2015.•excludes the potential effects of the resolution of litigation-related matters not substantially resolved as of june 28, 2015.48•exchange rates assumed are a blend of the actual exchange rates in effect through the second quarter of 2015 and the mid-july 2015 exchange rates for the remainder of the year. excludes the impact of a potential devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar.•guidance for reported revenues reflects the anticipated negative impact of $3.4 billion due to recent and expected generic competition for certain products that have recently lost or are anticipated to soon lose patent protection, partially offset by anticipated revenue growth from certain other products. •guidance for reported revenues also reflects the anticipated negative impact of approximately $3.3 billion as a result of unfavorable changes in essentially all foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar compared to foreign exchange rates from 2014.•guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted income does not assume the renewal of the u.s. research and development (r&d) tax credit. the renewal of the u.s. r&d tax credit is not anticipated to have a material impact on the effective tax rate on adjusted income.•guidance for reported and adjusted diluted eps assumes diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 6.25 billion shares, inclusive of share repurchases in 2015. share repurchases in 2015 were composed of $1.0 billion of shares repurchased through january 30, 2015, a $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in february 2015 and a $0.2 billion cash payment in july 2015 to satisfy the settlement terms of the accelerated share repurchase agreement. pfizer elected to settle the terms of the accelerated share repurchase agreement with cash as opposed to the commensurate value in shares. actual and projected dilution related to employee compensation programs is expected to partially offset these share repurchases.(b) for an understanding of adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted eps (all of which are non-gaap financial measures), see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.(c)

quarter of 2015, and increased $247 million, or 3%, in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, reflecting, among other things:◦the performance of several key products, including prevnar 13 primarily in adults, ibrance (which was launched in the u.s. in february 2015), eliquis, xeljanz, lyrica, viagra and celecoxib (collectively, up approximately $790 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $1.5 billion in the first six months of 2015),partially offset by: ◦losses of exclusivity and immediate multi-source generic competition for celebrex in the u.s. in december 2014 (down approximately $460 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $840 million in the first six months of 2015); ◦the loss of exclusivity for zyvox and rapamune, as well as the termination of our spiriva co-promotion collaboration (collectively, down approximately $140 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $280 million in the first six months of 2015); and◦the performance of certain other products such as lipitor, geodon and benefix, as well as the non-recurrence in 2015 of initial retailer stocking associated with the launch of nexium 24hr in may 2014 (collectively, down approximately $170 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $160 million in the first six months of 2015).•in our international markets, revenues decreased $1.0 billion, or 13%, in the second quarter of 2015, and decreased $1.7 billion, or 11%, in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014. foreign exchange unfavorably impacted international revenues by approximately $1.0 billion, or 13%, in the second quarter of 2015 and unfavorably impacted international revenues by approximately $1.8 billion, or 12%, in the first six months of 2015. operationally, 50revenues were relatively flat in the second quarter of 2015, increasing $37 million, and increased $134 million, or 1%, in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014 reflecting, among other things:◦the operational growth in emerging markets of prevenar 13, lipitor, zyvox, viagra (gep) and norvasc (collectively, up approximately $200 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $400 million in the first six months of 2015); and◦higher revenues in developed markets for eliquis and lyrica (gip), as well as from vaccines acquired in december 2014 from baxter (in europe) (collectively, up approximately $190 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $300 million in the first six months of 2015),partially offset by: ◦lower revenues for lyrica (gep), celebrex, inspra and viagra (gep) as a result of the loss of exclusivity, as well as lipitor, norvasc, and for the first six months of 2015, enbrel in developed markets, and vfend and zosyn/tazocin in emerging markets (collectively, down approximately $280 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $460 million in the first six months of 2015).during the second quarter of 2015, international revenues represented 58% of total revenues, compared to 62% in the second quarter of 2014. excluding foreign exchange, international revenues in the second quarter of 2015 represented 61% of total revenues, compared to 62% in the second quarter of 2014. during the first six months of 2015, international revenues represented 58% of total revenues, compared to 62% in the first six months of 2014. excluding foreign exchange, international revenues in the first six months of 2015 represented 62% of total revenues, compared to 63% in the first six months of 2014.for additional information about operating segment revenues, see the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a.revenue deductionsour gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized, and primarily represent rebates, chargebacks and sales allowances to government agencies, wholesalers/distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for the reporting period, and, as such, knowledge and judgment of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues, and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues. product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.the following table provides information about deductions from revenues:  three months ended six months ended(millions of dollars) june 28, 2015 june 29, 2014 june 28, 2015 june 29, 2014medicare

managers, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance terms and claims under these contracts. outside the u.s., performance-based contract rebates include rebates to wholesalers/distributors based on achievement of contracted performance for specific products or sales milestones.(c) chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to u.s. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d) sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the u.s., discounts and distribution fees.(e) for the three months ended june 28, 2015, associated with the following segments: gip ($1.0 billion); voc ($0.4 billion); and gep ($2.3 billion). for the three months ended june 29, 2014, associated with the following segments: gip ($0.7 billion); voc ($0.3 billion); and gep ($2.2 billion). for the six months ended june 28, 2015, associated with the following segments: gip ($1.9 billion); voc ($0.7 billion); and gep ($4.2 billion). 51for the six months ended june 29, 2014, associated with the following segments: gip ($1.4 billion); voc ($0.5 billion); and gep ($4.2 billion).total deductions from revenues for the second quarter of 2015 increased 15%, compared to the second quarter of 2014, and total deductions from revenues for the first six months of 2015 increased 11%, compared to the first six months of 2014, primarily as a result of:•an increase in chargebacks primarily due to products that have lost exclusivity in the u.s. and increasing competitive pressures, as well as increases for certain u.s. branded products; and•an increase in medicaid and related state program rebates, primarily as a result of updated estimates of sales related to these programs, as well as a decrease in managed medicaid estimated rebates in the second quarter of 2014.our accruals for medicare rebates, medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts totaled $3.2 billion as of june 28, 2015, of which approximately $1.9 billion is included in other current liabilities, $248 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities and approximately $1.0 billion is included against accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. our accruals for medicare rebates, medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts totaled $3.4 billion as of december 31, 2014, of which approximately $2.0 billion is included in other current liabilities, $300 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities and approximately $1.1 billion is included against accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. total accruals for medicare rebates, medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts as of june 28, 2015 decreased by approximately $200 million compared to december 31, 2014,

unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues of 6% in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014.in the u.s., revenues for prevnar increased 87% in the second quarter of 2015, and 84% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, mainly due to continued strong uptake among adults following the positive recommendation from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention’s (cdc) advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) for use in adults aged 65 and older in the third quarter of 2014 as well as the success of the promotional programs. internationally, revenues for prevenar increased 10% operationally in the second quarter of 2015, and 12% operationally in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, primarily reflecting increased shipments associated with gavi, the vaccine alliance, and the favorable impact of prevenar’s inclusion in additional national immunization programs in certain emerging markets. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 11% in the second quarter of 2015, and an unfavorable impact of 12% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014. in 2014, the acip voted to recommend prevnar 13 for routine use to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which includes pneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. these acip recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the cdc and u.s. department of health and human services, and were published in the morbidity and mortality weekly report in september 2014 by the cdc. as with other vaccines, the cdc regularly monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations; in this case, however, the cdc announced formally that it will conduct this review in 2018. currently, we are working with a number of u.s. investigators to monitor the proportion of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes included in prevnar 13 and continue to observe trends.in march 2015, the european commission approved an expanded indication for the use of prevenar 13 for the prevention of pneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes in the vaccine in adults aged 18 years and older. the summary of product characteristics has also been updated to include efficacy data from our landmark community-acquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults (capita), which demonstrated statistically significant reductions in first episodes of vaccine-type pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (cap), including non-invasive/non-bacteremic cap, and invasive pneumococcal disease (ipd) in adults aged 65 and older.•lyrica (gep (revenues from all of europe, russia, turkey, israel and central asia)/gip (all other revenues)) is indicated in the u.s. for three neuropathic pain conditions, fibromyalgia and adjunctive therapy for adult patients with

2015, we and our alliance partner, eli lilly & company, announced that we are preparing to resume the phase 3 clinical program for tanezumab. this announcement followed a decision by the fda to lift the partial clinical hold on the tanezumab development program after a review of nonclinical data characterizing the sympathetic nervous system response to tanezumab. a partial clinical hold had been in place for tanezumab since december 2012 due to adverse changes in the sympathetic nervous system of mature animals.additional product-related programs are in various stages of discovery and development. also, see the discussion in the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.costs and expensescost of sales  three months ended six months ended(millions of

due to lower additional depreciation—asset restructuring and lower costs to implement certain cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.in early 2014, we announced that we would be incurring costs in 2014-2016 related to new programs: our new global commercial structure reorganization and additional cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. we also have an ongoing manufacturing plant network rationalization and optimization initiative underway. for information about our current programs and expected total costs, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.the expected ongoing annual cost savings associated with our current programs, in the aggregate, are estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion by the end of 2016. the expected costs and cost savings in 2015 associated with these activities are reflected in our financial guidance for 2015. see also the “our financial guidance for 2015” section of this md&a.62in addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity

is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted income, and certain components of adjusted income, in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines, consumer healthcare (otc) products, and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are described below. also, see the “adjusted income––general description of adjusted income measure” section of our 2014 financial report for additional information. similarly, we have defined the adjusted income components as revenues, cost of sales, selling, informational and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, amortization of intangible assets and other (income)/deductions––net each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure and the adjusted income component measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income or u.s. gaap net income components. the adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted income measure is utilized:•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income basis;•our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis; and•senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted income measure. see the “adjusted income––general description of adjusted income measure” section of our 2014 financial report for additional information.despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.63we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a group of pharmaceutical industry peers (pre-2015) or a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans.see the accompanying reconciliations of certain gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted information for the second quarter and first six months of 2015 and 2014 below.purchase accounting adjustmentsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with pharmacia corporation (acquired in 2003), wyeth (acquired in 2009) and king pharmaceuticals, inc. (acquired in 2011), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.acquisition-related costsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.discontinued operationsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. certain significant itemsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our global commercial structure reorganization, and our other non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under u.s. gaap; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12a. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings, included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.64reconciliation of gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted information––certain

result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, partially offset by a decline in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years, with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. the effective tax rate on non-gaap adjusted income was 25.0% in the first six months of 2015, compared with 26.5% in the first six months of 2014. this decline was primarily due to a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of

(collectively, up approximately $220 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $380 million for the first six months of 2015); and ◦the continued strong performance of lyrica, primarily in the u.s. and japan, and viagra in the u.s. (collectively, up approximately $130 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $300 million for the first six months of 2015),partially offset by:◦generic competition for rapamune in the u.s., which began in october 2014, and by increased competition for benefix in the u.s. (collectively, down approximately $40 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $90 million for the first six months of 2015).71total gip revenues from emerging markets were $397 million in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $417 million in the second quarter of 2014 and were $734 million in the first six months of 2015, compared to $774 million in the first six months of 2014.•cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.4 percentage points in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange, a decrease in royalty expense and an increase in alliance revenues, which have no associated cost of sales. cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.3 percentage points in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange, an increase in alliance revenue, which have no associated cost of sales, and a decrease in royalty expense. the decrease in cost of sales of 19% in the second quarter of 2015, and 18% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, was primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in royalty expense.•the decrease in selling, informational and administrative expenses of 1% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, reflects favorable foreign exchange, largely offset by additional investment in recently launched products and certain in-line products. the increase in selling, informational and administrative expenses of 2% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, reflects additional investment in recently launched products and certain in-line products, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. •the increase in research and development expenses of 19% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily reflects investment in the late-stage pipeline, primarily bococizumab, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses as a result of the completion of postmarketing commitments for certain in-line products. the increase in research and development expenses of 39% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily reflects the $295 million upfront payment to opko, and investment in the late-stage pipeline, primarily bococizumab, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses as a result of the completion of postmarketing commitments for certain in-line products.global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare operating segment•revenues increased 21% in the second quarter of 2015, and increased 22% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, which includes an increase in revenues of 29% operationally in both the second quarter of 2015 and in the first six months of 2015.◦global vaccines revenues increased 44% to $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $1.1 billion in the same period in 2014, and increased 44% to $2.9 billion in the first six months of 2015, compared to $2.0 billion in the same period in 2014, reflecting an operational increase in revenues of 52% in both the second quarter of 2015 and in the first six months of 2015. the increases were primarily due to an 87% increase in the second quarter of 2015 and 84% in the first six months of 2015 in prevnar family revenue in the u.s., primarily driven by continued strong uptake among adults following the positive recommendation from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices for use in adults aged 65 and older in the third quarter of 2014. international revenues increased 25% operationally in the second quarter of 2015 and 23% operationally in the first six months of 2015, driven by the prevenar family, which grew 10% operationally in the second quarter of 2015 and 12% operationally in the first six months of 2015, primarily reflecting increased shipments associated with gavi, the vaccine alliance, and the favorable impact of prevenar’s inclusion in additional national immunization programs in certain emerging markets compared to the same periods in 2014, as well as the inclusion in the second quarter and first six months of 2015 of revenues associated with the acquisition of baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines in europe.foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 8% on vaccines revenues in both the second quarter of 2015 and in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods

2014, and increased 17% to $1.2 billion in the first six months of 2015, compared to $1.1 billion in the same period in 2014, reflecting an operational increase in revenues of 36% in the second quarter of 2015 and 27% in the first six months of 2015, primarily driven by our launch of ibrance in the u.s. in february 2015 for advanced breast cancer, and, to a lesser extent, stronger demand for sutent, inlyta and xalkori in most markets. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 11% on oncology revenues in the second quarter of 2015, and an unfavorable impact of 10% on oncology revenues in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014. 72total oncology revenues from emerging markets were $102 million in both the second quarter of 2015, and in the second quarter of 2014, and $188 million in the first six months of 2015, compared to $177 million in the first six months of 2014.◦consumer healthcare revenues decreased 8% to $840 million in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $912 million in the same period in 2014, reflecting an operational decrease in revenues of 2% in the second quarter of 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the non-recurrence of initial retailer stocking associated with the launch of nexium 24hr in the u.s. in late-may 2014. excluding nexium 24hr, revenues in the consumer healthcare business in the u.s. increased 5% driven by increased promotional support for key brands. additionally, revenues from emerging markets increased 11% operationally, primarily driven by china and venezuela. revenues decreased 1% to $1.6 billion in the first six months of 2015, compared to $1.7 billion in the same period in 2014, reflecting an operational increase in revenues of 4% in the first six months of 2015, primarily due to the launch of nexium 24hr in the u.s. in late-may 2014, as well as growth in dietary supplement products in certain emerging markets primarily driven by china and venezuela. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 6% on consumer healthcare revenues in the second quarter of 2015, and an unfavorable impact of 5% on consumer healthcare revenues in the first six months of 2015. total consumer healthcare revenues from emerging markets were $247 million in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $240 million in the second quarter of 2014, and were $485 million in the first six months of 2015, compared to $462 million in the first six months of 2014.•cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.5 percentage points in the second quarter of 2015 and decreased 2.7 percentage points in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange, manufacturing efficiencies and a favorable change in product mix. the increase in cost of sales of 6% in the second quarter of 2015, and 5% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, was primarily due to an increase in sales volumes, including as a result of the acquisition of baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines in europe, largely offset by favorable foreign exchange and manufacturing efficiencies. •selling informational and administrative expenses increased 6% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily driven by promotional expenses for prevnar 13 in adults in the u.s., as well as the launch expenses for ibrance (palbociclib) in the u.s., partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. the increase in selling informational and administrative expenses of 9% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily driven by promotional expenses for prevnar 13 in adults in the u.s., as well as the launch expenses for ibrance and trumenba in the u.s., partially offset by favorable foreign exchange.•research and development expenses decreased 19% in the second quarter of 2015, and 9% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, primarily reflecting lower clinical trial spend for trumenba, prevnar 13 adult and certain oncology products, partially offset by increased costs associated with our vaccine and oncology programs, primarily our anti-pd-l1 alliance with merck kgaa.global established pharmaceutical operating segment•revenues decreased 22%, to $5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $6.5 billion in the same period in 2014, and decreased 19% to $10.1 billion in the first six months of 2015, compared to $12.5 billion in the same period in 2014, which includes an operational decrease in revenues of 14% in the second quarter of 2015 and 12% in the first six months of 2015, primarily due to:◦the loss of exclusivity and immediate launch of multi-source generic competition for celebrex in the u.s. in december 2014 as well as generic competition for zyvox in the u.s. beginning in the first half of 2015 and for lyrica in certain developed europe markets beginning in the first quarter of 2015 (collectively, down by approximately $630 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2015);◦a decline in lipitor revenues in developed markets as a result of continued generic competition (down approximately $90 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $130 million for the first six months of 2015); and◦the termination in most countries of the co-promotion collaboration for spiriva, including in the u.s. (where the collaboration expired in april 2014), which has resulted in a decline in pfizer’s share of spiriva revenues (down approximately $30 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $100 million for the first six months of 2015), 73partially offset by:◦growth in emerging markets, where revenues increased 2% operationally for the second quarter of 2015 and 6% for the first six months of 2015, primarily driven by lipitor, zyvox, viagra and norvasc (collectively, up by approximately $120 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $220 million for the first six months of 2015). foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 8% on gep revenues in the second quarter of 2015, and an unfavorable impact of 7% on gep revenues in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in

compared to $3.6 billion in the first six months of 2014.•cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 0.5 percentage points in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the impact of losses of exclusivity resulting in an unfavorable change in product mix, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. the decrease in cost of sales of 19% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange, lower volumes due to products losing exclusivity, and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in royalty expense. cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 0.8 percentage points in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the impact of losses of exclusivity resulting in an unfavorable change in product mix, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. the decrease in cost of sales of 15% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange and lower volumes as a result of products losing exclusivity.•selling, informational and administrative expenses decreased 18% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to lower field force, advertising and promotional expenses, reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. the decrease in selling, informational and administrative expenses of 17% in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to lower field force, advertising and promotional expenses, reflecting the benefits of cost reduction and productivity initiatives, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by a higher cost for the branded prescription drug fee compared to the prior year.•research and development expenses were largely unchanged in the second quarter of 2015 and in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same periods in 2014, reflecting increased investment in biosimilar and sterile injectable development programs, offset by lower clinical trial expenses related to postmarketing commitments, primarily for celebrex and pristiq. •the unfavorable change in other (income)/deductions––net in the first six months of 2015, compared to the same

inventory acquired as part of the acquisition of baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines, recorded at acquisition date fair value, as well as inventory builds in advance of plant shutdowns/product transfers, partially offset by planned inventory reductions. •for property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation (pp&e), the change also reflects depreciation, largely offset by capital additions in the normal course of business and, to a lesser extent, the pp&e assets acquired as part of the acquisition of baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines.•for identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, the change reflects amortization, partially offset by identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of baxter’s portfolio of marketed vaccines. for

debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:•the working capital requirements of our operations, including our research and development activities;•investments in our business;•dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•share repurchases;•the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•paying down outstanding debt;•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•business-development activities.our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service (moody’s). see the “credit ratings” section below. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified and available-for-sale debt securities.selected measures of liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table provides certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital

cash flows” sections of this md&a.agreement to acquire hospira, inc. (hospira)on february 5, 2015, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we agreed to acquire hospira, the world’s leading provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies and a global leader in biosimilars, for $90 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $17 billion. we expect to finance the transaction through a combination of existing cash and new debt, with approximately two-thirds of the value financed from cash and one-third from debt. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions, and is expected to close in the second half of 2015. on may 13, 2015, hospira shareholders voted in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which was also a condition to closing the transaction. on august 4, 2015, the european commission approved the transaction under the eu merger regulation. the european commission’s decision includes our commitment to divest certain assets in the eu. domestic and international short-term fundsmany of our operations are conducted outside the u.s., and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. we generally hold up to $10 billion of these short-term funds in u.s. tax jurisdictions. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s. federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided.accounts receivablewe continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. historically, payments from a number of these european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale. there have been some improvements in the amount of outstanding accounts receivable balances in excess of one year. however, we have received virtually no payments in 2015 from the greek government on outstanding receivables, and the greek government has recently restructured its debt to other third parties. accordingly, we have adjusted our allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect these events, resulting in $46 million in net receivables as of june 28, 2015, and are evaluating ways of changing our greek operations, which may result in decreased sales in the future. other potential actions by the greek government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of some of our investments in greece. reported revenues from greece for the six months ended june 28, 2015 were $109 million. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on an analysis of the following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistency of payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).as of june 28, 2015, we had about $678 million in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in italy, spain, greece and portugal where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $56 million, were as follows: $31 million in italy; $14 million in portugal; $10 million in greece; and $1 million in spain.although certain european governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to appropriately balance repayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.we will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with 78estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1c. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions included in our 2014 financial report.credit ratingstwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s and s&p, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:name of rating agency pfizer commercial paper  pfizerlong-term debt date of last rating change rating ratingoutlook moody’s p-1 a1stable october 2009s&p a-1+ aastable october 2009debt capacitywe have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of june 28, 2015, we had access to $8.2 billion of lines of credit, of which $732 million expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.0 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of our unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2019, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings.see also “agreement to acquire hospira” above.global economic conditions––generalthe global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. global economic conditions––venezuela operations our venezuela operations continue to operate with the u.s. dollar as the functional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy. on february 13, 2013, the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 4.3 to 6.3 of venezuelan currency to the u.s. dollar. we incurred a foreign currency loss of $80 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets.in the second quarter of 2015, the venezuelan government identified three official rates of exchange. these are the cencoex rate of 6.3; the sicad rate of 12.8 (as of july 2015); and the simadi rate of about 200 (as of july 2015). we continue to use the cencoex rate of 6.3 to report our venezuela financial position, results of operations and cash flows, since we believe that the nature of our business operations in venezuela (the importation, manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products and, to a lesser extent, consumer healthcare goods) would qualify for the most preferential rates permitted by law. further, the venezuelan government has indicated that essential goods, including medicines, will remain at the official rate of 6.3.while we believe it is appropriate to continue to use the official rate of 6.3 for remeasurement purposes, we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or whether our use of the 6.3 rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances. further, other potential actions by the venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in venezuela, which could result in an impairment charge and, under extreme circumstances, could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically. due to the uncertainty of the effect of recent changes in the venezuelan economy and a slowing of actual 79conversions of venezuelan currency to u.s. dollars, we have made changes in our venezuelan operations and are evaluating other potential changes. our actions could result in decreased sales from our venezuelan operations in the future.as of june 28, 2015, our net monetary assets in venezuela that are subject to revaluation totaled approximately $694 million (remeasured at the 6.3 rate). our revenues from venezuela totaled approximately $194 million for the second quarter of 2015 and $408 million for the first six months of 2015 (converted using the 6.3 rate). off-balance sheet arrangementsin the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of june 28, 2015, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.share-purchase plans and accelerated share repurchase agreementon june 27, 2013, we announced that the board of directors had authorized a $10 billion share-purchase plan, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2015. on october 23, 2014, we announced that the board of directors had authorized an additional $11 billion share-purchase plan, and share purchases commenced thereunder in january 2015. on february 9, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with goldman, sachs & co. (gs&co.) to repurchase shares of our common stock. this agreement was entered into under our previously announced share repurchase authorization. this agreement was completed in july 2015, and pursuant to the agreement’s settlement terms, we elected to settle the agreement in cash and paid an additional $160 million to gs&co. on july 13, 2015, resulting in a total of approximately $5.2 billion paid to gs&co. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12. commitments and contingencies.the following table provides the number of shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including our accelerated share repurchase agreement:  three months ended six months

adopted: standard description effective date  effect on the financial statements or other significant matters       in november 2014, financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued amended guidance related to accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued or held as investments. the new guidance clarifies that for hybrid financial instruments in the form of stock, the assessment of whether the embedded derivative is clearly and closely related to the host instrument must consider the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument, including the embedded derivative feature that is being evaluated for separate accounting from the host contract.  january 1, 2016 we do not expect that the provisions of this new standard will have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements.in august 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance related to disclosure of uncertainties about the ability of an entity to continue as a going concern. the new guidance requires management of all entities to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and, as necessary, to provide related footnote disclosures. december 31, 2016 we do not expect that the provisions of this new standard will have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.in may 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. the new guidance introduces a new principles-based framework for revenue recognition and disclosure. january 1, 2017. early adoption is not permitted.(a) we have not yet decided on a method of adoption (full retrospective or modified retrospective basis) and we have not yet determined the potential impact, if any, of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.in july 2015, the fasb issued an update related to inventory.  the new guidance requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. january 1, 2017 we do not expect the provisions of this new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.(a) in april 2015, the fasb issued an exposure draft to propose a one-year deferral of the effective date. at its july 9, 2015 meeting, the fasb agreed to defer by one year the mandatory effective date of its revenue recognition standard, but will also provide entities the option to adopt it as of the original effective date. forward-looking information and factors that may affect future resultsthis report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks
