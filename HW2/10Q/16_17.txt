effects$246 $(228)(2) also referred to as “earnings” in the discussions that follow.  net income attributable to chevron corporation for first quarter 2013 was $6.2 billion ($3.18 per share — diluted), compared with $6.5 billion ($3.27 per share — diluted) in the corresponding 2012 period. upstream earnings in first quarter 2013 were $5.9 billion, compared with $6.2 billion in the 2012 quarter. the decrease was due to lower crude oil realizations and volumes, partially offset by favorable tax items and lower exploration expense. downstream earnings were $701 million in first quarter 2013, compared with $804 million in the year-earlier period. the decline was mainly due to the absence of 2012 gains on asset sales and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher margins. refer to pages 28 through 30 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for first quarter 2013 versus the same period in 2012.business environment and outlookchevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela, and vietnam.earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the level of the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year.to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required. identifying promising 24table of contentsareas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments.the company’s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the united states. from time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company. governments may attempt to do so in the future. civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the company’s operations or investments. those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. refer to the “results of operations” section, beginning on page 28, for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2013. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.25table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $112 per barrel for the full-year 2012. during first quarter 2013, brent averaged $113 per barrel and ended april at about $101. the most recent price for brent-related crudes in the atlantic basin declined as a result of negative economic developments, high refinery maintenance in europe and higher north sea production. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. the wti price averaged $94 per barrel for the full-year 2012. during first quarter 2013, wti averaged $94 per barrel and ended april at about $93. wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2012 and first quarter 2013 due to high inventories and excess crude supply in the u.s. midcontinent market.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the differential eased globally in the first quarter 2013. in the united states, light sweet crude oil production in the midcontinent region remained robust and outbound capacity at cushing remained constrained. outside of the united states, heavy refinery maintenance schedules in europe and elsewhere reduced demand and price support for light sweet crudes.chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, chad, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 33 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $3.45 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in the first three months of 2013, compared with $2.47 during the first three months of 2012. at the end of april 2013, the henry hub spot price was $4.28 per mcf. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. international natural gas realizations averaged $6.07 per mcf during the first three months of 2013, compared with $5.88 in the same period last year. (see page 33 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)the company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2013 averaged 2.645 million barrels per day. about one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2013 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for first quarter 2013 or 2012. at their december 2012 meeting, members of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day, which has been in effect since december 2008.26table of contentsthe company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2013 will average approximately 2.650 million barrels per day based on a brent price of $112 per barrel. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups or ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the united states.on november 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field about 75 miles offshore brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. the source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned. no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to this seep has emerged. on march 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. as a precautionary measure, the company and its partners decided to temporarily suspend field production and received approval from brazil’s national petroleum agency (anp) to do so.  chevron and its partners are cooperating with the brazilian authorities. on july 19, 2012, anp issued its final investigative report on the november 2011 incident. on april 8, 2013, anp approved a plan for partial restoration of  production in the frade field. a brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking $10.7 billion in damages for each of the two seeps. the company is not aware of any basis for damages to be awarded in any civil lawsuit. on july 31, 2012, a court presiding over the civil litigation entered a preliminary injunction barring chevron from conducting oil production and transportation activities in brazil pending completion of the legal proceedings commenced by the federal district prosecutor and the ongoing proceedings of anp and the brazilian environment and natural resources regulatory agency. on september 28, 2012, the injunction was modified to clarify that chevron may continue its containment and mitigation activities under supervision of anp. on appeal, on november 27, 2012, the injunction was revoked in its entirety. the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against 11 chevron employees. jurisdiction for all three matters was moved from campos to a court in rio de janeiro. on february 19, 2013, the court dismissed the criminal matter, which is being appealed by the prosecutor. the company’s ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable, but could be significant to net income in any one period.the company has entered into a nonbinding financing term sheet with petroboscan, a joint stock company owned 39.2 percent by chevron, which operates the boscan field in venezuela. when finalized, the financing is expected to occur in stages over a limited drawdown period and is intended to support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreed-upon level. the terms are designed to support cash needs for ongoing operations and new development, as well as distributions to shareholders — including current outstanding obligations. the loan will be repaid from future petroboscan crude sales. definitive documents are under negotiation.refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 28 through 29 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply 27table of contentsfunctions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 29 through 30 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels, and technology companies.operating developmentsnoteworthy operating developments for the upstream business in recent months included the following:•australia - signed binding long-term sales and purchase agreements with chubu electric power company for wheatstone lng. more than 80 percent of  chevron's equity lng offtake from wheatstone is covered under long-term agreements.•australia - reached agreement to acquire interests in two onshore natural gas blocks in the cooper basin.•australia - announced a natural gas discovery, elfin-1, in the carnarvon basin in 50 percent-owned block wa-268-p. •republic of congo - reached final investment decision on the deepwater moho nord joint development.•united states - announced a crude oil discovery at the coronado prospect in the deepwater gulf of mexico.•united states - announced a successful production test of a st. malo well in the deepwater gulf of mexico. the company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in first quarter 2013 under its share repurchase program.results of operationsbusiness segments the following section presents the results of operations for the company’s business segments — upstream and downstream — as well as for “all other.” (refer to note 5, on page 10, for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments,” as defined

in first quarter 2013 decreased $397 million from the same period last year. the decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil realizations of about $190 million and higher operating expenses of about $130 million.the company’s average realization for u.s. crude oil and natural gas liquids in first quarter 2013 was $94 per barrel, compared with $102 a year earlier. the average natural gas

quarter 2013 was up 13,000 barrels per day, or about 2 percent, from a year earlier. the increase in production was primarily due to further ramp-up of projects in the gulf of mexico, the marcellus shale in western pennsylvania and recently-acquired delaware basin properties in new mexico, partially offset by normal field declines. the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 455,000 barrels per day for first quarter 2013 was largely unchanged from the corresponding 2012 period. net natural gas production was 1.26 billion cubic feet per day in first quarter 2013, an

$135 million in the first quarter 2013, compared with earnings of $459 million a year earlier. the decrease was due to higher operating expenses of $180 million, primarily as a result of turnaround activity at the refineries in el segundo, california and pascagoula, mississippi, as well as lower margins of $180 million on refined product sales.  the decrease was partly offset by higher earnings of $80 million from the 50 percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem).refinery crude-input of 576,000 barrels per day in first quarter 2013 was down 350,000 barrels per day from the corresponding 2012 period.  the decline was primarily due to repairs of the crude unit at the refinery in richmond, california, which has been offline since august 2012, and a planned crude unit turnaround at the refinery in pascagoula.  29table of contentsrefined product sales of 1.10 million barrels per day declined 141,000 barrels per day from first quarter 2012, mainly reflecting lower

with $8.4 billion in the year-ago period. the decline reflected working capital requirements in the current period.dividends the company paid dividends of $1.7 billion to common shareholders during the first three months of 2013. in april 2013, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 11.1 percent to $1.00 per common share, payable in june 2013.debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $14.1 billion at march 31, 2013, up from $12.2 billion at december 31, 2012.the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the authorized borrowing limit under this program is $12.0 billion and the outstanding balance at march 31, 2013 was $4.7 billion. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $8.1 billion at march 31, 2013 and $6.0 billion at december 31, 2012. of these amounts, $6.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at march 31, 2013 and $5.9 billion at december 31, 2012, respectively. at march 31, 2013, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at march 31, 2013, the company had $6.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in december 2016, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at march 31, 2013. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in november 2015 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation, chevron corporation profit sharing/savings plan trust fund and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poor’s corporation and aa1 by moody’s investors service. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of
