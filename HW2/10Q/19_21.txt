of earnings datafor the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we reported net earnings of $934 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.60 compared to net earnings of $834 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.51 for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. for the first nine months of fiscal 2011, we reported net earnings of $3.1 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.97 compared to net earnings of $2.8 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.65 for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.net sales increased 4.4% to $17.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 from $16.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. for the first nine months of fiscal 2011, net sales increased 2.9% to $54.4 billion from $52.9 billion for the first nine  months of fiscal 2010. our comparable store sales increased 4.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, driven primarily by a 3.0% increase in our comparable store average ticket. comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 3.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.in the first nine months of fiscal 2011, we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives:customer service – our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of taking care of our associates, putting customers first and simplifying the business. in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we rolled out a new scheduling system for our associates and a new centralized return to vendor process. both the new scheduling system and the new return to vendor process are allowing us to increase customer facing hours in our stores at the same time that we are improving overall labor productivity.product authority – our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, including innovation, assortment and value. as part of a multi-phased project to improve our special order performance, we completed digitizing our vendor catalogs in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. when completed, the new system will make the special order process both simpler and more accurate for our associates.productivity and efficiency – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency starts with disciplined capital allocation focused on building best-in-class competitive advantages in information technology and supply chain, as well as building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. since the completion of the roll out of our rapid deployment centers (“rdcs”) in fiscal 2010, we have 11table of contentsbeen adding mechanization to the rdcs and have seen benefits in capacity, efficiency and accuracy. by the end of fiscal 2012, we expect 18 of the 19 rdcs will be mechanized. in terms of building shareholder value, during the first nine months of fiscal 2011, we repurchased a total of 87 million shares through open market purchases and our $1.0 billion accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement. in addition, on november 15, 2011 we announced a 16% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 29 cents per share.interconnected retail – our focus on interconnected retail is based on the view that providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels will be a critical enabler for future success. our multiple channel focus is allowing us to greatly expand our assortment of merchandise, and we are making the investment to build these capabilities, including the roll out of buy on-line, pick-up in store, which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. we are also upgrading our online platform and expect to complete the upgrade by the end of fiscal 2011. we opened one new store in mexico and one new store in st. croix in the u.s. virgin islands during the third quarter of fiscal 2011.  we also temporarily closed one store due to flooding damage during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, for a total store count of 2,246 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011. as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011, a total of 274 of these stores, or 12.2%, were located in canada, mexico and china compared to 268 stores, or 11.9%, as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010.we generated $5.7 billion of cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. we used a portion of this cash flow to fund $2.1 billion of share repurchases in addition to shares purchased under the asr agreement, pay $1.2 billion of dividends, and fund $820 million in capital expenditures.at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio increased to 60.4% from 45.8% at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 driven primarily by higher debt levels in the current year. our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 14.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to 12.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2010.12table of contentswe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.  % of

to $17.3 billion from $16.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. for the first nine months of fiscal 2011, net sales increased 2.9% to $54.4 billion from $52.9 billion for the comparable period in fiscal 2010. the increase in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. total comparable store sales increased 4.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 1.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. for the first nine months of fiscal 2011, total comparable store sales increased 2.7% compared to an increase of 2.6% for the same period of fiscal 2010.the positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011 reflect a number of factors. our performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 was driven by storm related sales arising from hurricane irene and early winter weather, as well as strength in our core departments. the majority of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011, and comparable store average ticket increased 3.0% and 2.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011, respectively. comparable store sales for our tools, electrical, indoor garden, building materials, plumbing and hardware product categories were above the company average for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. comparable store sales for our paint, flooring, lighting and kitchen product categories were positive for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. comparable store sales for our lumber, outdoor garden, bath and millwork product categories were negative for the third quarter of 2011.gross profit increased 4.9% to $6.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 from $5.7 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. gross profit increased 3.3% to $18.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 from $18.1 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2010. gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 15 basis points to 34.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to 34.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. for the first nine months of fiscal 2011, gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.3% compared with 34.2% for the comparable period of fiscal 2010, an increase of 16 basis points. the increase in gross profit margin in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011 was driven by benefits arising from our supply chain transformation in the u.s., which was partially offset by a change in the mix of products and services sold as well as higher shrink compared to last year.selling, general and administrative expense (“sg&a”) increased 3.1% to $4.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 from $3.8 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, and increased 0.9% to $12.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 from $12.0 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2010. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 22.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to 23.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. for the first nine months of fiscal 2011, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 22.3% compared to 22.8% for the same period last year. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment partially offset by expenses related to natural disasters. additionally, sg&a for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by a $32 million impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 for a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business that was subsequently sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.depreciation and amortization decreased 2.5% to $390 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 from $400 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. depreciation and amortization was $1.2 billion for the first nine months of both fiscal 2011 and 2010. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 2.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to 2.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, and was 2.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 compared to 2.3% for the same period in fiscal 2010. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011 was a function of an increased number of fully depreciated assets.operating income increased 11.5% to $1.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 from $1.4 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. operating income increased 11.0% to $5.3 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 from $4.8 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2010.in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we recognized $158 million of interest and other, net, compared to $142 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. we recognized $443 million of interest and other, net, in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 compared to $479 million for the same period last year. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.9% for the third quarter of both fiscal 2011 and 2010. for the first nine months of fiscal 2011, interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.8% compared to 0.9% for the same period last year. interest and other, net, for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 reflects a $51 million pretax charge taken in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to the extension of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of hd supply, inc.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for the first nine months of both fiscal 2011 and 2010.diluted earnings per share were $0.60 and $1.97 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011, respectively, compared to $0.51 and $1.65 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2010, respectively. diluted earnings per share 14table of contentsfor the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011 reflect $0.03 and $0.10, respectively, of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended october 30, 2011.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. during the first nine months of fiscal 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.7 billion compared to $4.0 billion for the same period of fiscal 2010. this increase was primarily a result of an increase in net earnings, changes in inventory levels and other net working capital items.net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $683 million compared to $624 million for the same period of fiscal 2010. this change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from sale of business, net, related to the sale of a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 was $3.3 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the same period of fiscal 2010. in march 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of 4.40% senior notes due april 1, 2021 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 5.95% senior notes due april 1, 2041 at a discount of $4 million (together, the “march 2011 issuance”). interest on these senior notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2011. the net proceeds of the march 2011 issuance were used to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock, and the balance of the net proceeds were used to repay our 5.20% senior notes that matured march 1, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.in connection with the march 2011 issuance, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. under the agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution and received a total of 27 million shares during the first nine months of fiscal 2011. also during the first nine months of fiscal 2011, we repurchased an additional 60 million shares of our common stock for $2.1 billion through the open market. as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011, $6.8 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization.in may 2010, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million, which was accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the march 2011 issuance. upon the march 2011 issuance, we settled this forward starting interest rate swap agreement for an immaterial amount.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. as of october 30, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. the credit facility expires in july 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants. as of october 30, 2011, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.as of october 30, 2011, we had $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.15table of contents
