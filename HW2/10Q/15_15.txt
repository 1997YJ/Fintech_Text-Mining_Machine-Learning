resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues are derived from the sale of our products, as well as through alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies (alliance revenues).on june 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of our animal health business (zoetis). the operating results of this business are reported as income from discontinued operations––net of tax in the condensed

performancerevenues in the third quarter of 2013 were $12.6 billion, a decrease of 2% compared to the same period in 2012, which reflects an operational decline of $38 million, or less than 1%. the operational decrease was primarily the result of:•the continued erosion for branded lipitor in the u.s., developed europe and certain other markets (approximately $239 million);•other product losses of exclusivity (approximately $276 million); •the ongoing expiration of the spiriva collaboration in certain countries (approximately $163 million); and•decreased government purchases of the prevnar family of products and enbrel in certain emerging markets (approximately $48 million),partially offset by:•the growth of certain products, including lyrica, enbrel, inlyta, xalkori, celebrex and xeljanz (approximately $361 million) as well as various other biopharmaceutical products (approximately $162 million) in developed markets;•the overall growth in the rest of the emerging markets

healthcare business unit (approximately $8 million); and•revenues from the transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with zoetis (approximately $67 million).in addition, revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately $272 million, or 2%, in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.revenues in the first nine months of 2013 were $38.0 billion, a decrease of 7% compared to the same period in 2012, which reflects an operational decline of $1.9 billion, or 5%. the operational decrease was primarily the result of:53table of contents•the continued erosion for branded lipitor in the u.s., developed europe and certain other markets (approximately $1.7 billion);•the loss of exclusivity for geodon in march 2012 in the u.s (approximately $184 million);•other product losses of exclusivity (approximately $900 million);•the ongoing expiration of the spiriva collaboration in certain countries (approximately $341 million); •lower revenues from atorvastatin (approximately $162 million); and •decreased government purchases of the prevnar family of products and enbrel in certain emerging markets (approximately $130

addition, revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $793 million, or 2%, in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2013 was $2.6 billion, compared to $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting, among other items:•lower revenues, primarily due to the continued erosion of branded lipitor in the u.s., developed europe and certain other markets, other product losses of exclusivity, the ongoing expiration of the spiriva collaboration in certain countries, decreased government purchases of the prevnar family of products in certain emerging markets and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange;•higher asset impairments and related charges (up approximately $429 million, pre-tax) (see also the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net); and •a higher effective tax rate, primarily due to (i) a favorable settlement in 2012 with the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) related to audits for multiple tax years; specifically, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion (representing tax and interest), as well as (ii) a tax benefit recorded for the resolution of foreign audits pertaining to multiple tax years (see also the “costs and expenses––provision for taxes on income” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 5. tax matters),partially offset by:•lower net charges for legal matters (down approximately $726 million, pre-tax) (see also the “costs and expenses––other (income)/deductions––net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other (income)/deductions––net); •additional benefits generated from our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, partially offset by spending to support new product launches; and•the non-recurrence of a $250 million (pre-tax) payment to astrazeneca in the third quarter of 2012 to obtain the exclusive over-the-counter rights to nexium. see also the “discontinued operations” section of this md&a.54table of contentsincome from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2013 was $8.8 billion compared to $7.5 billion in the first nine

tax matters).see also the “discontinued operations” section of this md&a.our operating environmentindustry-specific challengesthe majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we face a number of industry-specific challenges, which can significantly impact our results. these factors include, among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, pipeline productivity and the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition among branded products.intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rightsthe loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. our 2013 financial guidance reflects the anticipated impact in 2013 of the loss of such rights as described below (see the “our financial guidance for 2013” section of this md&a for additional information).our financial results have been and/or will be adversely impacted by the following:•lipitor in the u.s.––we lost exclusivity for lipitor in the u.s. in november 2011. the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s. began in may 2012, with attendant increased competitive pressures.55table of contentslipitor in international markets––lipitor lost exclusivity in australia in april 2012 and most of developed europe in march 2012 and may 2012, and now faces multi-source generic competition in those markets. lipitor has lost exclusivity in all major markets.•other recent loss of exclusivity impacts––in the u.s., we lost exclusivity for geodon in march 2012 and revatio tablet in september 2012. we lost exclusivity for xalatan and xalacom in the majority of european markets in january 2012 and australia in july 2012. we lost exclusivity for aricept in the majority of european markets in february 2012 and april 2012. caduet lost exclusivity in the majority of european markets in march and may 2012. we lost exclusivity in the u.s. for detrol ir in june 2012. detrol ir and detrol la lost exclusivity in most european markets in september 2012. viagra lost exclusivity in most major eu markets in june 2013. we lost exclusivity for lyrica in canada in february 2013.•spiriva—our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim (bi) for spiriva expires on a country-by-country basis between 2012 and 2016, including the expiration in certain eu markets, canada and australia in early 2013 and in the u.s. and certain other eu markets in early 2014, which is adversely impacting our 2013 results. we expect to experience a graduated decline in revenues from spiriva through 2016.•aricept—our rights to aricept in japan returned to eisai co., ltd. in december 2012. the aricept 23mg tablet lost exclusivity in the u.s. in july 2013.•enbrel—our u.s. and canada collaboration agreement with amgen inc. for enbrel expired on october 31, 2013. while we are entitled to royalties for 36 months thereafter, we expect that those royalties will be significantly less than our previous share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canada sales. in addition, while our share of the profits from this collaboration previously was included in revenues, our royalties after october 31, 2013 will be included in other (income)/deductions––net, in our consolidated statements of income. outside the u.s. and canada, our exclusive rights to enbrel continue in perpetuity.•rebif—our collaboration agreement with emd serono inc. to co-promote rebif in the u.s. will expire at the end of 2015. for additional information, including with regard to the expiration of the patents and of co-promotion and licensing rights for various products in the u.s., eu and japan in 2013 and subsequent years, see the “patents and intellectual property rights” section of our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a and the “the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights” section of our 2012 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a.we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights whenever we deem appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues––selected revenues from biopharmaceutical products” section of this md&a. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation.regulatory environment/pricing and access––u.s. healthcare legislationin march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (together, the u.s. healthcare legislation, and also known as the affordable care act or aca), was enacted in the u.s. as explained more fully in our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a, this legislation has resulted in both current and longer-term impacts on us. we recorded the following amounts as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation:•$133 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $179 million in the third quarter of 2012, and $364 million in the first nine months of 2013 and $413 million in the first nine months of 2012, recorded as a reduction to revenues, related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •$78 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $75 million in the third quarter of 2012, and $209 million in the first nine months of 2013 and $256 million in the first nine months of 2012, recorded in selling, informational and administrative expenses, related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for u.s. income tax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs.56table of contentsregulatory environment/pricing and access––certain other u.s. federal government mattersin august 2011, the federal budget control act of 2011 (the budget control act) was enacted in the u.s. the budget control act includes provisions to raise the u.s. treasury department's borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling, and provisions to reduce the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion between 2012 and 2021. initial deficit-reduction targets included $900 billion of discretionary spending reductions associated with the department of health and human services and various agencies charged with national security, but those discretionary spending reductions did not include programs such as medicare and medicaid or direct changes to pharmaceutical pricing, rebates or discounts. the office of management and budget (omb) was responsible for identifying the remaining $1.5 trillion of deficit reductions, which were divided evenly between defense and non-defense spending. under this omb review process, social security, medicaid, veteran benefits and certain other spending categories were excluded from consideration, but reductions in payments to medicare providers were made, although these reductions were prohibited by law from exceeding 2% of the originally budgeted amount. additionally, certain payments to medicare part d plans, such as low-income subsidy payments, were exempt from reduction as was all patient cost-sharing under medicare. as a result, we do not expect that the budget control act will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. however, any significant spending reductions affecting medicare, medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit-reduction effort or legislative replacement for the budget control act could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. after the u.s. federal debt ceiling was reached on may 19, 2013 and after measures taken by the u.s. treasury department to enable the u.s. federal government to continue meeting its financial obligations were nearly exhausted, on october 16, 2013, legislation was enacted that (i) ended the partial shutdown of the u.s. federal government and provided funding for u.s. federal government operations through january 15, 2014, and (ii) increased the u.s. federal debt ceiling through february 7, 2014 and preserved the ability of the u.s. treasury department to use “extraordinary measures” to avoid a default on u.s. federal government debt for a few months thereafter. if, after the expiration of those respective periods, the u.s. federal government fails to provide funding to avoid a partial or total shutdown of its operations and/or fails to suspend enforcement of or to increase the debt ceiling, and if, as a result, the u.s. federal government is unable to conduct drug review and approval activities or satisfy its financial obligations, including under medicare, medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, our results of operations could be adversely affected. pricing and access––increasing pressures to reduce healthcare cost growth rates in the u.s.as the healthcare cost growth rate in the u.s. continues to outpace inflation, cost-reduction and access pressures are increasing in intensity. containing entitlement spending, including medicare and medicaid, is a major focus of deficit-reduction efforts. the aca, which expanded the role of the u.s. government as a healthcare payer, is accelerating changes in the u.s. healthcare marketplace, and the potential for additional pricing and access pressures continues to be significant. some employers, seeking to avoid the tax on high-cost health insurance in the aca imposed in 2018, are already scaling back healthcare benefits. overall, there is increasing pressure on u.s. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions. these new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. at the same time, these models can also expand utilization by encouraging physicians to screen, diagnose and treat-to-goal. in response to the evolving u.s. and global healthcare spending landscape, we are continuing to work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major u.s. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products. further, we are seeking to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs. the global economic environmentin addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, and as explained more fully in our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a, we, like other businesses, continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment, which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the u.s. and europe, including the countries that use the euro, and in a number of emerging markets. 57table of contents•we believe that patients, experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment, including high unemployment levels, and increases in co-pays, sometimes switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments to reduce their costs. challenging economic conditions in the u.s. also have increased the number of patients in the medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many states, to formulary restrictions limiting access to brand-name drugs, including ours. in addition, we continue to experience pricing pressure in various markets around the world, including in developed european markets, japan and in a number of emerging markets, with government-mandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products and government-imposed access restrictions in certain countries. in addition, some government agencies and third-party payers use health technology assessments in ways that, at times, lead to lower prices for and restricted access to new medicines.•we continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. historically, payments from a number of these european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale, with no significant changes in the year-over-year trend. for further discussion about our accounts receivable, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.•significant portions of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen, the u.k. pound, the chinese renminbi, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will increase, having a positive impact, and our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact, on net income. likewise, if the u.s. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact, and our overall expenses will decrease, having a positive impact on net income. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.on february 13, 2013, the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 4.3 to 6.3 of venezuelan currency to the u.s. dollar. we incurred a foreign currency loss of $80 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets, and we have experienced and will continue to experience ongoing adverse impacts to earnings as our revenues and expenses will be translated into u.s. dollars at lower rates. we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or devaluations of any other currencies.despite the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial condition, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a; in part ii, item 1a., “risk factors”, of this quarterly report on form 10-q; and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a.our strategywe believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. we continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. we continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to patients and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. we remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company's purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that significantly improve their lives. by doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders.58table of contentscommercial operationswe currently manage our commercial operations through four operating segments––primary care, specialty care and oncology, established products and emerging markets, and consumer healthcare. for additional information about our current operating structure, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 13a. segment, geographic and other revenue information: segment information.on july 29, 2013, we announced plans to internally create a new global commercial organization structure. beginning in fiscal 2014, we will manage our commercial operations through three businesses––the global innovative pharmaceutical business (gip); the global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare business (voc); and the global established pharmaceutical business (gep). a significant change effected by this new structure is the full integration of emerging markets into each business. emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our new structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets.some additional information about each product grouping:•global innovative pharmaceutical business––gip will generally comprise medicines within several therapeutic areas that are expected to have market exclusivity beyond 2015, as well as enbrel. these therapeutic areas include immunology and inflammation, cardiovascular/metabolic, neuroscience and pain, rare diseases and women's/men's health. •global vaccines, oncology and consumer healthcare business––voc will focus on the development of vaccines and products for oncology and consumer healthcare. each of the three businesses comprising this group will operate as a separate, global business, requiring distinct specialization in terms of the science, talent and market approach necessary to deliver value to consumers and patients.  •global established pharmaceutical business––gep will include the brands that have lost market exclusivity and, generally, the mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 in most major markets. additionally, gep will include our biosimilars portfolio and current and future established products initiatives, such as our existing agreements with mylan in japan, hisun in china and teuto in brazil.the gip and voc biopharmaceutical portfolios of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line products will be sustained by ongoing internal investments and targeted business development designed to maximize the value of our in-line products and ensure a robust pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need. in addition, voc will include our consumer healthcare business, which manufactures and markets several well-known brands. the assets to be managed by these groups are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers. gep will be expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. gep will leverage our experience in biologic development, manufacturing and commercialization. these changes will not be implemented until 2014 to allow for the necessary internal transition process. beginning with our first-quarter 2014 financial results, we will provide greater financial transparency into our new businesses.research operationswe continue to transform our global research and development organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d with the goal of building a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and the system's overall productivity. as such, our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules––immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines. other areas of focus include rare diseases and biosimilars. 59table of contentswhile a significant portion of r&d is done internally, we continue to seek to expand our pipeline by entering into agreements with other companies to develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. collaboration, alliance and license agreements and acquisitions allow us to capitalize on these compounds to expand our pipeline of potential future products. in addition, collaborations and alliances allow us to share risk and to access external scientific and technological expertise.for additional information about r&d by operating segment, see the “research and development––operations and product development” section of this md&a.for additional information about our pending new drug applications and supplemental filings, see the “research and

broad portfolio of businesses and to expand our r&d pipeline through various business development transactions. for additional information about recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe advance our pipeline and maximize the value of our in-line products, see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.intellectual property rightswe continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. in addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches designed to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity.for additional information about our current efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation.capital and expense managementwe seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and robust liquidity so that we continue to have the financial resources necessary to take advantage of prudent commercial, research and business development opportunities and to directly enhance shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. for additional information about our financial condition, liquidity, capital resources, share purchases and dividends, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.we remain focused on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the company. for additional information about our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, see the “costs and expenses-restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a.60table of contentsour business development initiativeswe are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate profitable revenue growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. we are especially interested in opportunities in our high-priority therapeutic areas––immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines––and in emerging markets and established products. other areas of focus include rare diseases and biosimilars. we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities for our businesses.the more significant recent transactions and events are described below:•collaboration with eli lilly & company (lilly)––in october 2013, we entered into a collaboration agreement with

•a decrease in operational revenues of approximately $162 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, due to multi-source generic competition in the u.s. for atorvastatin beginning in late-may 2012; and•a decrease in operational revenues of approximately $48 million in the third quarter and $130 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, due to decreased government purchases of the prevnar family of products and enbrel in certain emerging markets,partially offset by:•an increase in operational revenues of approximately $186 million in the third quarter and $595 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, due to continued growth in developed markets of certain biopharmaceutical products, particularly lyrica, inlyta and xalkori; and•an increase in operational revenues of approximately $166 million in the third quarter and $493 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, due to continued growth in the emerging markets unit related to various products.the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on biopharmaceutical revenues of $271 million in the third quarter and $782 million in the first nine months of 2013, or 2% in both periods, also contributed to a decrease in biopharmaceutical revenues.geographically, •in the u.s., revenues from biopharmaceutical products were relatively flat in the third quarter of 2013 and decreased 6% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, reflecting, among other things:◦lower revenues from lipitor, revatio and geodon, all due to loss of exclusivity (down approximately $188 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $918 million in the first nine months of 2013); ◦lower revenues from spiriva, reflecting the final-year terms of our spiriva co-promotion agreement in the u.s.

the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, reflecting, among other things: ◦lower revenues for lipitor and xalatan/xalacom (down approximately $152 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2013) due to the loss of exclusivity of lipitor in developed europe, japan and australia, and xalatan/xalacom in the majority of european markets and in australia; lower revenues for viagra, (down approximately $48 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $72 million in the first nine months of 2013) 65table of contentsprimarily due to loss of exclusivity in most major markets in europe; and lower revenues for aricept (direct sales) (down approximately $18 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $75 million in the first nine months of 2013) due to the loss of exclusivity in certain markets;   ◦lower alliance revenues (down approximately $110 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $372 million in the first nine months of 2013), primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of aricept in many major european markets, the return of our rights to aricept in japan to eisai co., ltd., and lower revenues for spiriva in certain european countries, canada and australia (where the spiriva collaboration has terminated); and◦lower revenues for the prevnar family of products and enbrel, (down approximately $48 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $130 million in the first nine months of 2013) due to decreased government purchases in certain emerging markets, partially offset by:◦higher revenues for lyrica, and new product growth from inlyta and xalkori, (collectively, approximately $104 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $346 million in the first nine months of 2013).the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on international biopharmaceutical revenues of 4% in both the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2013 also contributed to the decrease in revenues from biopharmaceutical products in our international markets.during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, international revenues from biopharmaceutical products represented 59.6% and 60.4% of total revenues from biopharmaceutical products, compared to 60.6% and 61.1% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, respectively.primary care operating segmentprimary care unit revenues decreased 10% in the third quarter of 2013 and 16% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, reflecting lower operational revenues of 8% and 14% in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, primarily due to:•the loss of exclusivity of lipitor and the resulting shift in the reporting of lipitor revenues in developed europe and australia to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2013, as well as the loss of exclusivity of certain other products in various markets, including viagra in most major markets in europe in june 2013 and lyrica in canada in february 2013;•the termination of the co-promotion agreement for aricept in japan in december 2012; and•in the u.s. and certain european countries, the co-promotion collaboration for spiriva is in its final year, which per the terms of the collaboration agreement, has resulted in a decline in pfizer's share of spiriva revenues; and in australia, canada and certain other european countries, the spiriva collaboration has terminated, partially offset by:•the strong performance of celebrex, chantix and pristiq in the u.s., as well as lyrica.the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2% in both the third quarter of 2013 and the first nine months of 2013, also contributed to the decrease in primary care unit revenues. collectively, the decline in revenues in developed markets for lipitor and for certain other primary care unit products that lost exclusivity in various markets in 2012, as well as the resulting shift in the reporting of certain product revenues to the established products unit, reduced primary care unit revenues by approximately $584 million, or 16%, in comparison with the third quarter of 2012, and reduced primary care unit revenues by approximately $2.3 billion, or 20%, in comparison with the first nine months of 2012. specialty care and oncology operating segment•specialty care unit revenues decreased 2% in the third quarter of 2013 and 6% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, reflecting a decrease in operational revenues of 1%  and 4% in the third quarter of 2013 and in the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to:◦the loss of exclusivity and the resulting shift in the reporting of geodon and revatio revenues in the u.s. and xalabrands revenues in developed europe and australia to the established product unit beginning january 1, 2013,largely offset by:◦the growth of enbrel and xeljanz in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013.66table of contentsthe unfavorable impact

with the third quarter of 2012, and reduced specialty care unit revenues by approximately $762 million, or 7%, in comparison with the first nine months of 2012. •oncology unit revenues increased 24% in the third quarter of 2013 and 25% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, reflecting higher operational revenues of 26% and 28% in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, due to:◦the recent launches of new products, most notably inlyta and xalkori in several major markets,partially offset by:◦the decline in sutent revenues in the eu and japan, due to increased competition and cost-containment measures in those markets, as well as some conversion from sutent to inlyta in japan due to a broader label for inlyta in japan, which overlaps with the sutent indication.inlyta’s market share continues to increase as patient feedback has been positive both in terms of efficacy and tolerability, and as pricing and reimbursement are being granted in developed europe. xalkori prescriptions and new patient starts also continue to increase, driven by initiatives established to improve molecular testing and identify the appropriate patients for this medicine.the operational increases in oncology unit revenues were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2% and 3% in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively. established products and emerging markets operating segment•established products unit revenues decreased 4% in the third quarter of 2013 and 11% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, reflecting a decrease in operational revenues of 1% and 8% in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, primarily due to:◦the continued erosion of branded lipitor in the u.s, and japan,partially offset by:◦revenues from products in certain markets that were shifted to the established products unit from other business units beginning january 1, 2013, including lipitor in developed europe and australia; and◦the contribution from the collaboration with mylan inc. to market generic drugs in japan.the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3% in both the third quarter of 2013 and in the first nine months of 2013 also contributed to the decrease in established products unit revenues.•emerging markets unit revenues increased 2% in both the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, due to higher operational revenues of 5% in both the third quarter and the first nine

in china in the first quarter of 2013; and◦decreased government purchases of prevenar and enbrel, as well as government cost-containment measures, in certain emerging markets.the operational increases in emerging markets unit revenues were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3% in both the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2013. total revenues from established products in both the established products and emerging markets units were $3.3 billion, with $1.0 billion generated in emerging markets, in the third quarter of 2013, and were $10.1

are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized and primarily represent rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results generally have been less than 1% of biopharmaceutical net sales and can result in either a net increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.the following table provides information about certain deductions from revenues:  three months ended nine months ended(millions of dollars) september 29, 2013 september 30, 2012 september 29, 2013 september 30, 2012medicaid and related state program

of contracted performance for specific products or sales milestones.(c) chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d) sales allowances primarily represent pharmaceutical rebates, discounts and price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside of the u.s.the total rebates and chargebacks for the third quarter of 2013 increased compared to the same period in 2012, primarily as a result of:•an increase in performance-based contract rebates in the u.k. and china as a result of competitive factors and contract arrangements;•an increase in medicare rebates driven by increased volume; and•an increase in chargebacks for our branded products as a result of increasing competitive pressures, partially offset by:•a decrease in sales chargebacks for certain products that have lost exclusivity. 68table of contentsthe total rebates and chargebacks for the first nine months of 2013 decreased compared to

adult patients with partial onset seizures. in certain countries outside the u.s., indications include neuropathic pain (peripheral and central), fibromyalgia, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder. worldwide revenues for lyrica increased 10% in both the third quarter of 2013 and in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to volume growth, including increased demand for the neuropathic pain indication in japan. in the u.s., revenues increased 18% in the third quarter of 2013 and 17% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. notwithstanding these increases, u.s. revenues continue to be affected by increased competition from generic versions of competitive medicines, as well as managed care pricing and formulary pressures. internationally, lyrica revenues increased 3% in the third quarter of 2013 and 6% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, with the growth due to a focus on enhancing diagnosis and treatment rates of neuropathic back pain and expediting the identification and appropriate treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in the eu, and physician education regarding neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in japan. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 3% in both the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. •prevnar family of products consists of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 and prevnar/prevenar (7-valent), our pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for the prevention of various syndromes of pneumococcal disease. overall, worldwide revenues for the prevnar family of products increased 1% for the third quarter of 2013 and decreased 6% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. in the u.s., revenues for the prevnar family of products increased 7% in the third quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, mainly due to price increases and an inventory build by the centers for disease control and prevention(cdc) in the third quarter of 2013, partially offset by lower demand related to lower birth rates, lower rates of children receiving the final dose of the approved dosing schedule, and stronger cdc inventory management procedures. revenues in the u.s. for the prevnar family of products decreased 6% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, due to inventory sell-through in the public and private markets and lower demand, as described above. internationally, revenues for the prevnar family of products decreased 4% in the third quarter of 2013, and decreased 5% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to lower purchases in turkey, the end of the catch-up program in australia/new zealand and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.we currently are conducting the community-acquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults (capita) to fulfill requirements in connection with the fda’s approval of the prevnar 13 adult indication under its accelerated approval program. capita is an efficacy trial involving subjects 65 years of age and older that is designed to evaluate whether prevnar 13 is effective in preventing the first episode of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes contained in the vaccine. case accrual for this event-driven trial was completed in late august 2013. in view of the size of the study,  it will take several months to complete the necessary database validation and related activities prior to unblinding the study and reporting the topline results. we expect to report the topline results in early 2014. at its regular meeting held on february 22, 2012, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) indicated that it will defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older until the results of capita, as well as data on the impact of pediatric use of prevnar 13 on the disease burden and serotype distribution among adults, are available. the rate of uptake for the use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older has been impacted by acip’s decision to defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in that population. at its regular meeting held on june 20, 2012, acip voted to recommend the use of prevnar 13 for adults 19 years of age and older with immuno-compromising conditions such as hiv infections, cancer, advanced kidney disease and other immuno-compromising conditions. this recommendation is based on the disproportionate burden of invasive pneumococcal disease in this patient population.•enbrel, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis affecting the spine, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues, excluding the u.s. and canada, of 4% in the third quarter of 2013, while revenues remained relatively unchanged for the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. results were favorably impacted by the overall growth in the anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) biologic market and unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange and by decreased government purchases in brazil.71table of contentsunder our co-promotion agreement with amgen inc. (amgen), we co-promote enbrel in the u.s. and canada and share in the profits from enbrel sales in those countries, which we have included in alliance revenues. our co-promotion agreement with amgen expired in october 2013, and, subject to the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to a royalty stream for 36 months thereafter, which we expect will be significantly less than our share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canadian sales prior to the expiration. the royalties that will be paid to us during the 36-month period will be included in other (income)/deductions––net rather than in revenues in our consolidated statements of income. following the end of the royalty period, we will not be entitled to any further revenues from enbrel sales in the u.s. and canada. our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the u.s. and canada will not be affected by the expiration of the co-promotion agreement with amgen.•celebrex, indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis worldwide and for the management of acute pain in adults in the u.s., japan and certain other markets, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 11% in the third quarter of 2013 and 8% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to strong performance in the u.s. in the u.s., revenues increased 16% in the third quarter of 2013 and 11% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily driven by price increases and overall market growth, partially offset by volume erosion due to ongoing generic pressure, as well as higher rebates and sales allowances. internationally, celebrex revenues increased 3% in the third quarter of 2013 and 1% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. strong operational performance in international markets was driven by growth in japan (strong performance in the low back pain and osteoarthritis indications), south korea (strong performance in the rheumatology and orthopedic sectors), and in emerging markets, primarily driven by latin america and china, partially offset by lower revenues in the developed markets in europe in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 5% in both the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. •lipitor is for the treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood. lipitor has lost exclusivity and faces generic competition in all major markets. branded lipitor recorded worldwide revenues of $533 million, or a decrease of 29%, in the third quarter of 2013, and $1.7 billion, or a decrease of 49%, in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, due to:◦the impact of loss of exclusivity; ◦the continuing impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition from generics and branded products worldwide; and ◦the increased payer pressure worldwide, including the need for flexible rebate policies. geographically,◦in the u.s., revenues decreased 59% in the third quarter of 2013, and 62% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012; and ◦in our international markets, revenues decreased 18% in the third quarter of 2013, and 45% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of $11 million in the third quarter and $33 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012.see the “our operating environment” section of this md&a for a discussion concerning losses of exclusivity for lipitor in various markets.•viagra is indicated for the treatment for erectile dysfunction. viagra worldwide revenues decreased 11% in the third quarter of 2013, and decreased 6% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to a decrease in international revenues. international revenues decreased 28% in the third quarter and 13% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to entry of generics in developed europe and other key developed markets. in emerging markets, the decrease was primarily due to the impact of both herbal and generic competition. loss of exclusivity for viagra in four major european markets occurred in late-june 2013 and reduced revenues for the three months and nine months ended september 29, 2013 by approximately $48 million and $72 million, respectively, in comparison with the same periods in 2012. revenues in the u.s. increased 2% in the third quarter and were essentially flat in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012.•zyvox is the world’s best-selling branded agent among those used to treat serious gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus-aureus. zyvox worldwide revenues decreased 3% in the third quarter of 2013 and increased 1% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. the decrease in the third quarter of 72table of contents2013 was primarily due to a prolonged supply interruption of zyvox iv in china that is expected to continue through early 2014, and also reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.•norvasc, for the treatment of hypertension, lost exclusivity in the u.s. and other major markets in 2007 and in canada in 2009. norvasc worldwide revenues decreased 5% in the third quarter and 8% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, reflects, among other factors, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.•sutent is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc); gastrointestinal stromal tumors after disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate; and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. sutent worldwide revenues decreased 5% in the third quarter of 2013 and 2% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, due to decreases in developed europe and japan as a result of increased competition and cost-containment measures in those markets, as well as some conversion from sutent to inlyta in japan due to broader label for inlyta in japan, which overlaps with the sutent indication, partially offset by price increases in the u.s. and increases in uptake in key emerging markets, most notably russia. •our premarin family of products helps women address moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms. premarin worldwide revenues increased 5% in the third quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, and decreased 1% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. revenues in the u.s. were favorably impacted by two price increases and growth in premarin vaginal cream prescription volume, and unfavorably impacted by prescription volume declines for premarin family oral brands.•benefix and refacto af/xyntha are hemophilia products using state-of-the-art manufacturing that assist patients with their lifelong bleeding disorders. benefix recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 6% in the third quarter of 2013 and 7% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily as a result of increases in the u.s. due to the continued adoption of the 3000 international unit vial, as well as price increases, and increased revenues in japan, due to continued product adoption. refacto af/xyntha recorded a 3% increase in worldwide revenues in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to the final transition of patients to xyntha in australia due to the national tender secured in 2011, continued strong u.s. performance with competitive patient conversions, and with the successful launch in germany of the refacto af dual chamber syringe ("fusengo").•pristiq is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the u.s. and in various other countries. pristiq has also been approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (vms) associated with menopause in thailand, mexico, the philippines and ecuador. pristiq recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 14% in the third quarter of 2013 and 12% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to prescription growth in the emerging markets, canada and australia, as well as more favorable contract rebates and a price increase in the u.s.•chantix/champix is an aid to smoking-cessation treatment in adults 18 years of age and older. worldwide revenues increased 5% in the third quarter of 2013 and decreased 2% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012. revenues in the u.s. increased 32% in the third quarter of 2013 and 8% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to price increases in january and july 2013 and lower rebates. international revenues decreased 14% in the third quarter and decreased 11% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, primarily due to lower overall market growth across several key markets as a result of a challenging macro-economic environment, as well as the lingering impact from previous negative media exposure and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.•inlyta, for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (rcc) after failure of a prior systemic treatment, is approved in 55 countries, including the u.s., eu, switzerland, japan, canada, australia, south korea

see the “industry-specific challenges” section of this md&a for a discussion regarding the expiration of various contract rights relating to aricept, spiriva, enbrel and rebif. eliquis (apixaban) is being jointly developed and commercialized by pfizer and bristol-myers squibb (bms). in 2012, eliquis (apixaban) was approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the 27 countries of the eu, plus iceland and norway, canada, japan and the u.s. to date, we have launched that indication for eliquis in the u.s., uk, germany, denmark, japan, netherlands and sweden. the two companies share commercialization expenses and profit/losses equally on a global basis. while we are the third entrant in this market, we believe we have a differentiated product profile and continue to invest in medical education and peer-to-peer programs to assist physicians in understanding the data, and we have begun direct-to consumer advertising in the u.s.•embeda—a prior approval supplement for a manufacturing change was submitted to the fda in early july 2013. in early november 2013, the fda approved that change, and we anticipate returning embeda to the market in the second quarter of 2014.for additional information about our pending new drug applications and supplemental filings, see the “research and

to their sales and marketing responsibilities, are responsible for certain development activities. generally, these responsibilities relate to additional indications for in-line products and in-process research and development (ipr&d) projects that have achieved proof-of-concept. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights.(b) the decrease relates to the non-recurrence of a $250 million payment to astrazeneca in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 to obtain the exclusive, global, over-the-counter rights to nexium.(c) worldwide research and development is generally responsible for research projects until proof-of-concept is achieved, and then for transitioning those projects to the appropriate business unit for possible clinical and commercial development. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. this organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects. worldwide research and development is also responsible for all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety event activities. pfizer medical is responsible for the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, transparency and disclosure activities, clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, partnerships with global public health and medical associations, regulatory inspection readiness reviews, internal audits of pfizer-sponsored clinical trials and internal regulatory compliance processes. (d) corporate and other includes unallocated costs, primarily facility costs, information technology, share-based compensation, and restructuring-related costs. the decreases in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2013 primarily reflect lower charges relating to implementing our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives as well as efficiencies gained from these efforts (see the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a).product developments—biopharmaceutical we continue to invest in r&d to provide potential future sources of revenues through the development of new products, as well as through additional uses for in-line and alliance products. notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for existing products or any of our other products in development.we continue to transform our global research and development organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d with the goal of building a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d priorities include: delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and the system's overall productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules—immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines. other areas of focus include rare diseases and biosimilars. 75table of contentsour development pipeline, which is updated quarterly, can be found at www.pfizer.com/pipeline. it includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication, phase of development and, for late-stage programs, mechanism of action. the information currently in our development pipeline is accurate as of november 8, 2013.the following series of tables provides information about significant regulatory actions by, and filings pending with, the fda and regulatory authorities in the eu and japan, as well as additional indications and new drug candidates in late-stage development.recent fda approvalsproductindicationdate approvedduavee (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene)(a)treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women with a uterusoctober 2013eliquis (apixaban)(b)prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillationdecember 2012xeljanz (tofacitinib)treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritisnovember 2012(a) the fda approved the 0.45mg/20mg dose of duavee for these indications. we received a "complete response" letter from the fda with regard to the 0.625mg/20mg dose for these indications and for an indication for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.(b) this indication for eliquis (apixaban) was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with bms.pending u.s. new drug applications (nda) and supplemental filingsproductindicationdate filed*eliquis (apixaban)(a)prevention of venous thromboembolism following hip or knee replacement surgeryjuly 2013tafamidis meglumine(b)treatment of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (ttr-fap)february 2012genotropin mark vii multidose disposable device (somatropin rdna origin)(c)replacement of human growth hormone deficiencydecember 2009celebrex (celecoxib)(d)chronic painoctober 2009remoxy (oxycodone hydrochloride)(e)management of moderate-to-severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of timeaugust 2008viviant (bazedoxifene)(f)osteoporosis treatment and preventionaugust 2006* the dates set forth in this column are the dates on which the fda accepted our submissions.(a) this indication for eliquis (apixaban) was developed in collaboration with bms.(b) in may 2012, the fda's peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. in june 2012, the fda issued a “complete response” letter with respect to the tafamidis nda. the fda has requested the completion of a second efficacy study and also has asked for additional information on the data within the current tafamidis nda. we continue to work with the fda to define a path forward.(c) after receiving a “complete response” letter from the fda for the genotropin mark vii multidose disposable device submission, we submitted our response in august 2010. in april 2011, we received a second “complete response” letter from the fda, and we submitted our response in july 2013.(d) in june 2010, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the celebrex chronic pain supplemental nda. the supplemental nda remains pending while we await the completion of ongoing studies to determine next steps.(e) in 2005, king pharmaceuticals, inc. (king) entered into an agreement with pain therapeutics, inc. (pt) to develop and commercialize remoxy. in august 2008, the fda accepted the nda for remoxy that had been submitted by king and pt. in december 2008, the fda issued a “complete response” letter. in march 2009, king exercised its right under the agreement with pt to assume sole control and responsibility for the development of remoxy. in december 2010, king resubmitted the nda for remoxy with the fda. in june 2011, we and pt announced that a “complete response” letter had been received from the fda with regard to the resubmission of the nda. having achieved technical milestones related to manufacturing and following guidance received from the fda earlier in the year, we announced in october 2013 that we will proceed with the additional clinical studies and other actions required to address the "complete response" letter received in june 2011. these new clinical studies will include, in part, a pivotal bioequivalence study with the modified remoxy formulation to bridge to the clinical data related to the original remoxy formulation, and an abuse-potential study with the modified formulation. as previously disclosed, the "complete response" submission is not expected to occur prior to mid-2015.(f) two “approvable” letters were received by wyeth in april and december 2007 from the fda for viviant (bazedoxifene), for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, that set forth the additional requirements for approval. in may 2008, wyeth received an “approvable” 76table of contentsletter from the fda for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. the fda is seeking additional data, and we have been systematically working through these requirements and seeking to address the fda's concerns. in february 2008, the fda advised wyeth that it expects to convene an advisory committee to review the pending ndas for both the treatment and prevention indications after we submit our response to the “approvable” letters. in view of the recent approval of duavee by the fda, we are reassessing the next steps regarding our ndas for viviant. in april 2009, wyeth received approval in the eu for conbriza (the eu trade name for viviant) for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture. regulatory approvals and filings in the eu and japanproductdescription of eventdate approveddate filed*vyndaqel (tafamidis

charges and certain acquisition-related costs as well as costs associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives included in cost of sales, research and development expenses and/or selling, informational and administrative expenses, as appropriate.we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring, integrating and restructuring businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. for example:•in connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and•in connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives decreased 35% in the third quarter of 2013 and 48% in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, due to lower costs incurred in all categories: restructuring charges (down $38 million and $366 million, respectively), integration costs (down $41 million and $172 million, respectively), additional depreciation––asset restructuring (down $33 million and $224 million, respectively) and lower implementation costs (down $65 million and $99 million, respectively). the overall lower costs reflect the fact that we are in the later stages of these activities in connection with our recent acquisitions and recent cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives for more information. all of our businesses and functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development, as well as groups such as information technology, shared services and corporate operations. since the acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009, our cost-reduction initiatives announced on january 26, 2009, but not completed as of december 31, 2009, were incorporated into a comprehensive plan to integrate wyeth’s operations to generate cost savings and to capture synergies across the combined company. in addition, on february 1, 2011, among our ongoing cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we announced a new productivity initiative to accelerate our strategies to improve innovation and 79table of contentsproductivity in r&d by prioritizing areas that we believe have the greatest scientific and commercial promise, utilizing appropriate risk/return profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time.cost-reduction goalsas explained more fully in our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a, we achieved the global cost-reduction goals that had been established in 2009 and updated in 2011 for these major initiatives. in addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost-reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborations for various products.total coststhrough september 29, 2013, we incurred approximately $15.3 billion (pre-tax) in cost-reduction and acquisition-related costs (excluding transaction costs) in connection with the aforementioned initiatives. this $15.3 billion is a component of the $16.1 billion (pre-tax) in total restructuring charges incurred from the beginning of our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives in 2005 through september 29, 2013. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives for more information. in 2013, we expect to incur approximately $600-$800 million (after tax) in costs in connection with our ongoing cost-reduction/productivity initiatives and have reflected those costs, as well as the related expected cost reductions of approximately $1.0 billion (pre-tax), in our 2013 financial guidance. see also the “our financial guidance for 2013” section of this md&a. key activitiesas explained more fully in our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a, the targeted cost reductions were achieved through, among other things, the following actions, and we continue to generate cost reductions through similar actions:•the closing of duplicative facilities and other site rationalization actions company-wide, including research and development facilities, manufacturing plants, sales offices and other corporate facilities. among the more significant actions are the following:◦manufacturing: after the acquisition of wyeth, our manufacturing sites totaled 59. other acquisitions added 8 manufacturing sites, and we have subsequently exited 11 sites, resulting in 56 sites supporting continuing operations as of september 29, 2013. our plant network strategy is expected to result in the exit of a further seven sites over the next several years. these site counts exclude five nutrition business-related manufacturing sites as the nutrition business was sold in 2012, and exclude 24 zoetis sites as the disposition of the remaining 80.2% interest in zoetis common stock was completed on june 24, 2013. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2b. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: divestitures for more information.◦research and development: after the acquisition of wyeth, we operated in 20 r&d sites and announced that we would close a number of sites. we have completed a number of site closures, including our sandwich, u.k. research and development facility, except for a small presence. in addition, in 2011, we rationalized several other sites to reduce and optimize the overall r&d footprint. we disposed of our toxicology site in catania, italy; exited our r&d sites in aberdeen and gosport, u.k.; and disposed of a vacant site in st. louis, mo. we still maintain laboratories in st. louis, mo that focus on the areas of biologics and indications discovery. we are presently marketing for sale, lease or sale/lease-back, either a portion of or all of certain of our r&d campuses. locations with r&d operations are in the u.s., europe, canada and china, with five major research sites in addition to a number of specialized units. we also re-prioritized our commitments to disease areas and have discontinued certain therapeutic areas and r&d programs as part of our r&d productivity initiative. our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small and large molecules—immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines. other areas of focus include rare diseases and biosimilars.•workforce reductions across all areas of our business and other organizational changes, primarily in the u.s. field force, manufacturing, r&d and corporate functions. we identified areas for a reduction in workforce across all of our businesses. from 2009, when the workforce was approximately 130,000, through the end of 2012, we achieved a reduction of 38,500, and by the end of the third quarter of 2013, we achieved a reduction of 51,600. in the first nine months of 2013, the workforce declined by 13,100, from 91,500 to 78,400, primarily due to the full disposition of our animal health business (zoetis), which resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 9,300. the aforementioned workforce reductions include the impact of acquisitions and divestitures subsequent to the wyeth acquisition. 80table of contents•the increased use of shared services and centers of

in china, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2d. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: equity-method investments.change in tax lawon february 28, 2013, the governor of puerto rico signed into law act no. 2-2013, amending sections 2101 and 2102 of the puerto rico internal revenue code of 1994, which provided for an excise tax that was effective beginning in 2011 (act 154). the excise tax is imposed on the purchase of products by multinational corporations and their affiliates from their puerto rico affiliates. as originally adopted, the excise tax was to be in effect from 2011 through 2016 and the tax rate was to decline over time from 4% in 2011 to 1% in 2016. act no. 2-2013 extended the excise tax through 2017 and, effective july 1, 2013, increased the tax rate to 4% for all years through 2017. the impact of act no. 2-2013 is being recorded in cost of sales and provision for taxes on income. 82table of

certain legal entity reorganizations.adjusted incomegeneral description of adjusted income measureadjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines, consumer healthcare (over-the-counter) products, and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income. the adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted income measure is utilized:•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income basis;•our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis; and •senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted income measure. adjusted income is one of the performance metrics utilized in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are funded from a pool based on the achievement of three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from adjusted income. this metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool made available to elt members and other members of senior management and will constitute a factor in determining each of these individual’s bonus.despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not 83table of contentsbe comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, the earn-out of performance share award grants is determined based on a formula that measures our performance using relative total shareholder return.purchase accounting adjustmentsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with pharmacia (acquired in 2003), wyeth (acquired in 2009) and king (acquired in 2011), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research and development costs previously have been expensed.however, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.acquisition-related costsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some 84table of contentsactions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory authorities.discontinued operationsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations such as the gains on the full disposition of our former animal health business (zoetis) in june 2013 and the sale of our former nutrition business in november 2012. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. (restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented in this quarterly report on form 10-q on a restated basis for consistency across all periods.)certain significant itemsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transition service agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges or income related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12a. commitments and contingencies included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.reconciliationthe following table provides a reconciliation of

2012,partially offset by:•net cash paid, in the first nine months of 2012, of $782 million, for our acquisitions of alacer and ferrosan.90table of contentsfinancing activitiesour net cash used in financing activities was $9.2 billion in the first nine months of 2013, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $9.8 billion in the same period in 2012. the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:•net proceeds from borrowings of $6.0 billion in the first nine months of 2013, compared to net repayments of borrowings of $372 million in the first nine months of 2012; and•increased proceeds from the exercise of stock options,partially offset by:•purchases of common stock of $11.6 billion in the first nine months of 2013, compared to $4.8 billion in the first nine months of 2012; and•higher cash dividends paid.supplemental schedule of non-cash investing and financing informationin the first nine months of 2013, we:•sold our animal health business (zoetis) for pfizer common stock valued at $11.4 billion;•exchanged zoetis common stock for the retirement of pfizer commercial paper issued in 2013 for $2.5 billion;•exchanged zoetis senior notes for the retirement of pfizer commercial paper issued in 2012 for $1.0 billion; and•transferred certain product rights, valued at $1.2 billion, to an equity-method investment.for further details on zoetis-related transactions, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2b. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: divestitures, and for further details on the transfer of certain product rights, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2d. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: equity-method investments.analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources we rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. we believe that we have the ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we further believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:•the working capital requirements of our operations, including our research and development activities;•investments in our business;•dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•share repurchases;•the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•paying down outstanding debt;•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•business-development activities.our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service (moody's). see the “credit ratings” section below. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities.91table of contentsselected measures of liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table provides certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital

completed a public offering of $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. in addition, we repaid at maturity our 3.625% senior unsecured notes that were due june 2013, which had a balance of $2.4 billion at december 31, 2012.subsequent event––on november 4, 2013, the amended reorganization plan for our wholly owned subsidiary, quigley company, inc. (quigley or, subsequent to the effectiveness of the amended reorganization plan on november 4, 2013, reorganized quigley) became effective and, in compliance with the terms of that plan, among other actions, we transferred approximately $724 million in cash to reorganized quigley and the asbestos personal injury trust. in addition, in october 2013, in accordance with a group of pre-bankruptcy-proceeding settlements with counsel representing various plaintiffs in the quigley bankruptcy proceeding, we paid approximately $176 million in cash to plaintiffs' counsel for the benefit of claimants. at the time of these cash payments, we also derecognized certain of our asbestos-related liabilities, reported in other current liabilities as of september 29, 2013. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a2. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––product litigation.full separation of zoetis––impacts on liquidityas a result of the zoetis-related transactions, which were completed in the second quarter of 2013, among other impacts, we received approximately $6.1 billion of cash. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: divestitures.92table of contentsdomestic and international short-term funds many of our operations are conducted outside the u.s., and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. we generally hold approximately 10% to 30% of these short-term funds in u.s. tax jurisdictions. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s. federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided.accounts receivablewe continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. historically, payments from a number of these european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale, with no significant changes in the year-over-year trend.we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on an analysis of the following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistency of payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).as of september 29, 2013, we had about $1.3 billion in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in italy, spain, greece, portugal and ireland where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $321 million, were as follows: $121 million in italy; $115 million in spain; $47 million in greece; $32 million in portugal; and $6 million in ireland.although certain european governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to appropriately balance repayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.we will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1c. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions included in our 2012 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our annual report on form 10-k/a for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012.credit ratingstwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s and s&p, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:name of rating agencycommercial paper long-term

a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of september 29, 2013, we had access to $9.2 billion of lines of credit, of which $1.4 billion expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.5 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of the unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2016, may be used to support commercial paper borrowings.global economic conditionsthe challenging economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future.off-balance sheet arrangementsin the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of september 29, 2013, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.share-purchase planson november 1, 2012, we announced that the board of directors had authorized a $10 billion share-purchase plan, which became effective on november 30, 2012. on june 27, 2013, we announced that the board of directors had authorized an additional $10 billion share-purchase plan.in the first nine months of 2013, we purchased approximately 411 million shares of our common stock for approximately $11.6 billion under our publicly announced share-purchase plans. in the first nine months of 2012, we purchased approximately 213 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.8 billion under our publicly announced share-purchase plans. after giving effect to share purchases through september 29, 2013, our remaining share-repurchase authorization was approximately $10.2 billion.dividends on common stockin october 2013, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.24 per share, payable december 3, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on november 8, 2013.new accounting standardsrecently adopted accounting standardssee notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 1b. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: adoption of new accounting standards.94table of contentsrecently issued accounting standards, not adopted as of september 29, 2013 in july 2013, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued a clarification regarding the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit related to a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. under this new standard, this unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset if available under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position. otherwise, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a separate liability. the assessment is based on the unrecognized tax benefit and deferred tax asset that exist at the reporting date. the provisions of the new standard are effective on a prospective basis beginning in 2014 for annual and interim reporting periods, but early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the provisions of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, but certain amounts currently recorded in other taxes payable will be recorded, upon adoption and thereafter, primarily in noncurrent deferred tax liabilities.in march 2013, the fasb issued a clarification regarding the accounting for cumulative translation adjustment (cta) upon derecognition of assets or investment within a foreign entity. this new standard provides additional cta accounting guidance on sales or transfers of foreign entity investments and assets as well as step acquisitions involving a foreign entity. the provisions of the new standard are effective on a prospective basis in 2014 for annual and interim reporting periods. we do not expect the provisions of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. in february 2013, the fasb issued guidance regarding the measurement of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that may include debt agreements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation or judicial rulings. the provisions of this standard require that these obligations are measured at the amount representing the agreed-upon obligation of the company as well as additional liability amounts it expects to assume on behalf of other parties in the arrangement. the provisions of the new standard are effective on a retrospective basis in 2014 for annual and interim reporting periods. we do not expect the provisions of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.forward-looking information and factors that may affect future resultsthis report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” "aim" and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, our anticipated future operating or financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic reviews, capital allocation, business-development plans and plans related to share repurchases and dividends. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans relating to share repurchases and dividends, government regulation and financial results, including, in particular, the financial guidance set forth in the “our financial guidance for 2013” section of this md&a, the anticipated costs and cost savings set forth in the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a and the contributions that we expect to make from our general assets to the company's pension and postretirement plans during 2013 as described in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 10. pension and postretirement benefit plans. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:•the outcome of research and development activities including, without limitation, the ability to meet anticipated clinical trial commencement and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for product candidates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data;• decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve our drug applications, as well as their decisions regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of our products;• the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;95table of contents• the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss of marketing approval for a product or changes in the labeling for, and/or increased or new concerns about the safety or efficacy of, a product that could affect its availability or commercial potential;• the success of external business-development activities;• competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates;• the implementation by the fda of an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products to competition from biosimilar products in the u.s., with attendant competitive pressures, after the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period and patent rights;• the ability to meet generic and branded competition after the loss of patent protection for our products or competitor products;• the ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally;• difficulties or delays in manufacturing;•trade buying patterns; •the impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product exclusivity; •trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment; •the impact of the u.s. budget control act of 2011 (the budget control act) and the deficit-reduction actions to be taken pursuant to the budget control act in order to achieve the deficit-reduction targets provided for therein, and the impact of any broader deficit-reduction efforts; •the inability of the u.s. federal government to conduct drug review and approval activities or to satisfy its financial obligations, including under medicare, medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, that may result from the possible failure of the u.s. federal government in early 2014 to provide funding to avoid a partial or total shutdown of its operations and/or to suspend enforcement of or to increase the federal debt ceiling; •the impact of u.s. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010—the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act––and of any modification or repeal of any of the provisions thereof; •u.s. federal or state legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including under medicaid, medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs; the importation of prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries; direct-to-consumer advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals; and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines; •legislation or regulatory action in markets outside the u.s. affecting pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including, in particular, continued government-mandated price reductions for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european and emerging market countries; •the exposure of our operations outside the u.s. to possible capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies, as well as political unrest and unstable governments and legal systems; •contingencies related to actual or alleged environmental contamination; •claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates; •any significant breakdown, infiltration or interruption of our information technology systems and infrastructure; •legal defense costs, insurance expenses, settlement costs, the risk of an adverse decision or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to product liability, patent protection, government investigations, consumer, commercial, securities, antitrust, environmental and tax issues, ongoing efforts to explore various means for resolving asbestos litigation, and other legal proceedings; •our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property, both domestically and internationally; 96table of contents•interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates; •governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations, including, without limitation, tax obligations and changes affecting the tax treatment by the u.s. of income earned outside the u.s. that may result from pending and possible future proposals; •any significant issues involving our largest wholesaler customers, which account for a substantial portion of our revenues; •the possible impact of the increased presence of counterfeit medicines in the pharmaceutical supply chain on our revenues and on patient confidence in the integrity of our medicines; •any significant issues that may arise related to the outsourcing of certain operational and staff functions to third parties, including with regard to quality, timeliness and compliance with applicable legal requirements and industry standards; •changes in u.s. generally accepted accounting principles; •uncertainties related to general economic, political, business, industry, regulatory and market conditions including, without limitation, uncertainties related to the impact on us, our customers, suppliers and lenders and counterparties to our foreign-exchange and interest-rate agreements of challenging global economic conditions and recent and possible future changes in global financial markets; and the related risk that our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate; •any changes in business, political and economic conditions due to actual or threatened terrorist activity in the u.s. and other parts of the world, and related u.s. military action overseas; •growth in costs and expenses; •changes in our product, segment and geographic mix; and•the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, internal reorganizations, product recalls and withdrawals and other unusual items, including our ability to realize the projected benefits of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, including those related to our research and development organization, and of our plan to internally separate our commercial operations into three, new, global businesses effective january 1, 2014.we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports and our other filings with the sec.our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results. we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that form 10-k/a in this filing and investors should refer to it. reference is also made to part ii, item 1a, “risk factors,” of this quarterly report on form 10-q. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. this report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body of data. in addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.97table of contentslegal proceedings and contingencies information with respect to legal proceedings and contingencies required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to notes to
