("hd supply"), of which $100 million was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. net sales increased 5.4% to $20.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 from $19.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first nine months of fiscal 2014, net sales increased 4.7% to $64.0 billion from $61.1 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2013. our total comparable store sales increased 5.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by a 3.1% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 2.1% increase in our comparable store average ticket. comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 5.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. for the first nine months of fiscal 2014, our total comparable store sales increased 4.6%, and comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 5.2%.data breachin the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we confirmed that our payment data systems were breached, which could potentially impact customers who used payment cards at our u.s. and canadian stores. our investigation to date has determined the intruder used a vendor’s user name and password to enter the perimeter of our network. the intruder then acquired elevated rights that allowed it to navigate portions of our network and to deploy unique, custom-built malware on our self-checkout systems to access payment card information of up to 56 million customers who shopped at our u.s. and canadian stores between april 2014 and september 2014. on september 18, 2014, we confirmed that the malware used in the data breach had been eliminated from our systems. there is no evidence that debit pin numbers were compromised or that the data breach impacted stores in mexico or customers who shopped online at homedepot.com or homedepot.ca. in addition, we announced on november 6, 2014 that separate files containing approximately 53 million email addresses were also taken during the data 13table of contentsbreach. these files did not contain passwords, payment card information or other sensitive personal information. the investigation of the data breach is ongoing, and we are supporting law enforcement efforts to identify the responsible parties.we have completed a major payment security project that provides enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale in all of our u.s. stores, offering significant new protection for customers. the new security protection takes raw payment card information and scrambles it to make it unreadable to unauthorized users. roll-out of enhanced encryption to our canadian stores will be completed by early 2015. we are also rolling out emv chip-and-pin technology in our u.s. stores, which adds extra layers of payment card protection for customers. our canadian stores are already enabled with emv chip-and-pin technology.expenses incurredin the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded $43 million of pretax expenses related to the data breach, partially offset by a $15 million receivable for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage, for pretax net expenses of $28 million. these expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the three and nine months ended november 2, 2014. expenses include costs to investigate the data breach; provide identity protection services, including credit monitoring, to impacted customers; increase call center staffing; and pay legal and other professional services, all of which were expensed as incurred.litigation, claims and government investigationsin addition to the above expenses, we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us. the ultimate amount of these claims will likely include amounts for incremental counterfeit fraud losses and non-ordinary course operating expenses (such as card reissuance costs) that the payment card networks assert they or their issuing banks have incurred. in order for us to have liability for such claims, we believe it would have to be determined, among other things, that (1) at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handles payment card data was noncompliant with applicable data security standards, and (2) the alleged noncompliance caused at least some portion of the compromise of payment card data that occurred during the data breach. although an independent third-party assessor found the portion of our network that handles payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standards in the fall of 2013, the process of obtaining such certification for 2014 was ongoing at the time of the data breach and the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card networks may claim that we were not in compliance with those standards at the time of the data breach. as a result, we believe it is probable that the payment card networks will make claims against us and that we will dispute those claims. when those claims are asserted, we will have to determine, based on the facts and information then available to us, whether to litigate or seek to settle those claims. at this time, we believe it is probable that the claims will be asserted and that settlement negotiations will ensue, and believe that a loss in connection with these claims is reasonably possible. we cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses because no claims have yet been asserted and because there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate amount paid on payment card network claims could be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods.in addition, at least 44 actions have been filed in courts in the u.s. and canada, and other claims may be asserted against us on behalf of customers, payment card brands, payment card issuing banks, shareholders or others seeking damages or other related relief, allegedly arising from the data breach. furthermore, several state and federal agencies, including state attorneys general, are investigating events related to the data breach, including how it occurred, its consequences and our responses. we are cooperating in the governmental investigations, and we may be subject to fines or other obligations. while a loss from these matters is reasonably possible, we are not able to estimate the costs, or range of costs, related to these matters because the proceedings remain in the early stages, alleged damages have not been specified, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved. we have not concluded that a loss from these matters is probable; therefore, we have not recorded an accrual for litigation, claims and governmental investigations in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. we believe that it is reasonably possible that the ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations could be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods.future costswe expect to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the data breach in future periods. we will recognize these expenses as services are received. costs related to the data breach that may be incurred in future periods may also include credit card fraud and card reissuance costs for our private label credit card program, as well as incremental expenses and capital investments for remediation activities. we believe that it is reasonably possible that the 14table of contentsultimate amount paid on these services and claims could be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods.insurance coveragewe maintain $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to the data breach. as of november 2, 2014, we have recorded a receivable of $15 million for costs we have incurred to date that we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage.key initiativesin the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014, we continued to focus on the following key initiatives:customer service – our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first, taking care of our associates and simplifying the business. in the first nine months of fiscal 2014, we continued to make enhancements to our first phone, an associate and customer service tool. these enhancements include plans to introduce the next generation of our first phone to store associates throughout the remainder of fiscal 2014, which will allow for internet access to assist with questions and online orders and will be equipped to complete the check-out process in the aisle for our customers.product authority – our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering product innovation, assortment and value. using our new merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools, we completed a reset in fasteners resulting in a more effective mix of our private label brand, everbilt, with national brands. this reset also allowed us to introduce a larger assortment of innovative specialty fasteners. we also adjusted the cabinet hardware assortment throughout the u.s. to better serve our customers on a local level. we continued to partner with suppliers to introduce innovative new products and value to our customers. this includes plans to add 21 new kohler products to our bath and kitchen faucet assortment and to introduce new products for our professional customers featuring an exclusive series of carbide tipped reciprocating blades from diablo.disciplined capital allocation, productivity and efficiency – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we settled a $1.75 billion accelerated share repurchase (“asr”) agreement that was entered into in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. we received a total of 21.4 million shares of our common stock under the $1.75 billion asr agreement, including 4.5 million shares received upon settlement of the agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. also in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we repurchased 24.2 million shares of our common stock through the open market. during the first nine months of fiscal 2014, we repurchased a total of 67.6 million shares of our common stock for $5.7 billion through asr agreements and the open market. we opened two new stores in mexico during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, for a total store count of 2,266 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014, a total of 289 of our stores, or 12.8%, were located in canada and mexico.we generated $6.2 billion of cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2014. this cash flow, along with $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and cash on hand, was used to fund $5.6 billion of share repurchases, pay $1.9 billion of dividends and fund $999 million in capital expenditures.our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 22.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 19.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013.interconnected retail – our focus on interconnected retail, which connects our other three key initiatives, is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. during the first nine months of fiscal 2014, we continued to enhance our website and mobile experience, resulting in increased traffic to our websites, increased online sales conversion rates and an increase in the number of orders being picked up in our stores. we improved navigation, enhanced search capabilities and expanded chat functionality across our online platforms during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. sales from our online channels increased almost 40% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 compared to the same periods last year and represented approximately 4.4% of our total net sales at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. additionally, almost 40% of our online orders are picked up in our stores through our buy online, pick-up in store ("bopis") and buy online, ship to store ("boss") programs. as a result, we are installing dedicated storage bays in approximately 550 stores to 15table of contentshelp improve our customers' experience when picking up their orders. we also opened our second of three planned direct fulfillment centers, located in perris, california, during the third quarter of fiscal 2014. these highly automated facilities will support our online growth by providing a balance of cost efficiency and speed in shipping online orders to meet our customers' needs. we believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. % of net sales % increase (decrease)in dollar amounts three months ended nine months ended  november 2, 2014 november 3,

billion from $19.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first nine months of fiscal 2014, net sales increased 4.7% to $64.0 billion from $61.1 billion for the comparable period of fiscal 2013. the increase in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by customer transactions and average ticket growth. total comparable store sales increased 5.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 on top of an increase of 7.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first nine months of fiscal 2014, total comparable stores sales increased 4.6% on top of an increase of 7.6% for the same period of fiscal 2013.   the positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, continued strength in our maintenance and repair categories, and an improved u.s. home improvement market. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014. comparable store sales for our millwork, tools, kitchen, indoor garden, lumber, lighting, bath and plumbing product categories were above the company average for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 3.1% and 3.2% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014, respectively. our comparable store average ticket increased 2.1% and 1.5% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014, respectively, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases, such as water heaters, flooring and countertops.gross profit increased 5.7% to $7.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 from $6.8 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. gross profit increased 4.9% to $22.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 from $21.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2013. gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 10 basis points to 35.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 34.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first nine months of both fiscal 2014 and 2013, gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.7%. gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 reflects benefits from our supply chain and lower deferred financing costs, partially offset by higher shrink. gross profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 reflects benefits from sales mix changes partially offset by higher shrink.selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 3.0% to $4.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 from $4.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, and increased 1.1% to $12.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 from $12.6 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2013. sg&a for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 included $43 million of pretax expenses related to the data breach, partially offset by a $15 million receivable for costs we believe are reimbursable and probable of recovery under our insurance coverage, for pretax net expenses of $28 million. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 20.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 21.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first nine months of fiscal 2014, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 19.9% compared to 20.6% for the same period last year. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, strong expense controls, and lower management bonuses than last year, partially offset by expenses related to the data breach.depreciation and amortization increased 1.5% to $415 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 from $409 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. depreciation and amortization was $1.2 billion for the first nine months of both fiscal 2014 and 2013. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 2.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 2.1% for the third quarter of 2013, and was 1.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 compared to 2.0% for the same period of fiscal 2013. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, offset by higher depreciation related to capital expenditures that in recent years have been more heavily weighted toward technology assets, which have shorter depreciable lives.operating income increased 11.3% to $2.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 from $2.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. operating income increased 11.8% to $8.3 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 from $7.4 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2013. for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we recognized $113 million of interest and other, net, compared to $188 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. we recognized $395 million of interest and other, net, for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 compared to $521 million for the same period last year. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 1.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first nine months of fiscal 2014, interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.6% compared to 0.9% for the same period last year. these results reflect a $212 million pretax gain in the first nine months of fiscal 2014 related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in hd supply, of which $100 million was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. this was partially offset by additional interest expense incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014 as a result of the long-term debt issued in june 2014, as well as interest on some state tax settlements. 17table of contentsour combined effective income tax rate was 37.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 compared to 36.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2013.  diluted earnings per share were $1.15 and $3.66 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2014, respectively, compared to $0.95 and $3.02 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013, respectively. liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. during the first nine months of fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.2 billion compared to $6.0 billion for the same period in fiscal 2013. this increase was primarily due to a $594 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls partially offset by $292 million less in cash provided by a change in merchandise inventories due in part to supply chain disruptions.net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 was $767 million compared to $945 million for the same period in fiscal 2013. this change was primarily due to $212 million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in hd supply partially offset by a $35 million increase in capital expenditures in the first nine months of fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 was $5.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion for the same period of fiscal 2013. this change was primarily the result of $3.2 billion less of net proceeds from long-term borrowings and $213 million more in cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by $868 million less in repurchases of common stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.in june 2014, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.00% senior notes due june 15, 2019 (the "2019 notes") at a discount of $4 million and $1.0 billion of 4.40% senior notes due march 15, 2045 (the "2045 notes") at a discount of $15 million (together, the "june 2014 issuance"). interest on the 2019 notes is due semi-annually on june 15 and december 15 of each year, beginning december 15, 2014. interest on the 2045 notes is due semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning september 15, 2014. the net proceeds of the june 2014 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $950 million of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $950 million to the financial institution and received a total of 12.1 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $950 million asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement. in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.75 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.75 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of 16.9 million shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. the transaction was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time we received 4.5 million additional shares. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.75 billion asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement. in the first nine months of fiscal 2014, we also repurchased 34.1 million additional shares of our common stock for $3.0 billion in the open market.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in july 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. at november 2, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. as of november 2, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.as of november 2, 2014, we had $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, obligations incurred as a result of the data breach and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.18table of contentsrecent accounting pronouncementsin may 2014, the
