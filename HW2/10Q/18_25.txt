our financial results for the second quarter of 2010 were a result of a strong product mix with the
continued ramp of our new 32-nanometer microprocessor products, and continued declines in unit
cost. our revenue growth continued and the second quarter out-performed seasonal patterns in each
of our geographic regions. additionally, our second quarter results set quarterly records for
revenue of $10.8 billion, gross margin of 67%, operating income of $4.0 billion, and diluted
earnings per share of $0.51.

our second quarter revenue of $10.8 billion increased 5% from the first quarter of 2010.
microprocessor unit sales and microprocessor average selling prices were up slightly in the second
quarter compared to the first quarter due to strength in our server market segment and sales of our
new 32-nanometer notebook microprocessors. demand from the enterprise and small business market
segments for richer configurations drove an improved mix in our server and pc business. we also
continue to see pc sales driven by consumer purchases, particularly notebooks.

in the second quarter, we built additional inventory as we ramped our new 32-nanometer products in
anticipation of a seasonally stronger second half of the year. we are comfortable with inventory
levels across the supply chain.

our overall gross margin percentage for the second quarter was better than expected, setting a new
quarterly record. compared to the first quarter, our second quarter gross margin percentage
increased due to lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit cost, higher platform revenue,
and lower start-up costs, partially offset by fewer sales of previously written-off inventory. our
third quarter gross margin percentage is expected to be approximately flat to the second quarter,
with higher inventory write-offs of our microprocessor products not yet qualified for sale,
partially offset by higher platform revenue.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our process technology is, and will continue to be, a very important source of differentiation and
earnings power for the company. we continue to execute on our “tick-tock” technology development
cadence and have accelerated our 32-nanometer factory ramp. as a result of the accelerated ramp, we
have raised our 2010 capital spending outlook by $400 million, enabling us to meet the anticipated
demand of our new 32 nanometer process technology products based on our new microarchitecture, code
named sandy bridge, which we expect to introduce later in 2010.

from a financial condition perspective, we ended the second quarter of 2010 with an investment
portfolio of $17.8 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and
marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. the cash generating power of our business
was evident in the first half of 2010 with $7.6 billion of cash from operations. during the first
half of 2010, we returned $1.7 billion to stockholders through dividends, and in july, our board of
directors declared a dividend of $.1575 per common share to be paid in september.

strategy

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital economy. as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use
our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our
financial resources, global presence, brand recognition, and software development. we believe that
we have the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to
customers’ needs quickly.

some of our key focus areas are listed below:




 
•
 
customer orientation. our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of
products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. in turn, our products help
enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and
consumers. we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured
to work together to provide an optimized computing solution compared to components that are
used separately.


 

 
•
 
architecture and platforms. we are focusing on improved energy-efficient
performance for computing and communications systems and devices. improved energy-efficient
performance involves balancing improved performance with lower power consumption. we
continue to develop multi-core microprocessors with an increasing number of cores, which
enable improved multitasking and energy efficiency. in addition, to meet the demands of new
and evolving netbook, consumer electronics, and various embedded market segments, we offer
and are continuing to develop system on a chip (soc) products that are designed to provide
improved performance due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and smaller form
factors.


 

 
•
 
silicon and manufacturing technology leadership. our strategy for developing
microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new
microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. we plan to introduce a
new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon
process technology in the intervening years. this coordinated schedule allows us to develop
and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for
the next generation of silicon process technology. we refer to this as our “tick-tock”
technology development cadence. in keeping with this cadence, we expect to introduce a new
microarchitecture using our 32nm process technology later this year.


 

 
•
 
strategic investments. we make investments in companies around the world that
we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support
our key business initiatives. our investments, including those made through our intel
capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate
growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for intel, and expand
global markets for our products. our current investments primarily focus on the following
areas: advancing flash memory products, enabling mobile wireless devices, advancing the
digital home, enhancing the digital enterprise, advancing high-performance communications
infrastructures, and developing the next generation of silicon process technologies.


 

 
•
 
business environment and software. we believe that we are well positioned in
the technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote
industry standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. we plan
to continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer
products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. we frequently
participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical
specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted by standards-setting
organizations. through our software and services group, we help enable and advance the
computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers
create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms.
lastly, we believe that the software expertise of our wind river software group will
expedite our growth strategy in the embedded and handheld market segments.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we believe that the proliferation of the internet has driven the need for greater performance in
pcs and servers. older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that businesses and
individual consumers demand, such as video streaming and editing,
web conferencing, online gaming, social networking, and other memory-intensive applications. as
these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power, we believe that businesses
and individual consumers will need and want to buy new pcs. we also believe that increased internet
traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing, in which a group of linked servers provide a
variety of applications and data to users over the internet, create a need for greater server
infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and
virtualization.

we believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop
microprocessor units will continue and that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in
the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power
microprocessors. we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to
that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers, as a growing number of
households have multiple devices for different computing functions. our silicon and manufacturing
technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses
and form factors. we believe that intel® atomtm processors give us the
ability to extend intel® architecture and drive growth in new market segments,
including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded
applications, handhelds, consumer electronics devices, tablets, and netbooks. we expect that our
intel atom developer program will spur new applications that run on products using intel atom
processors, which will expedite our growth strategy in these new market segments. the common
elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to
access the internet.

we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many-core architecture aimed at
parallel processing, the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task. this
architecture will initially be used as a software development platform for throughput computing
(the need for large amounts of computing performance consistently over a long period of time). over
time, this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and
professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications.

in addition, we offer, and are continuing to develop, advanced nand flash memory products, focusing
on system-level solutions for intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives. in support
of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development
of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non-volatile,
low-cost, high-density memory.

critical accounting estimates

the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial
statements. some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.
our most critical accounting estimates include:




 
•
 
the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments,
net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;


 

 
•
 
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross
margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their
depreciation;


 

 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including
the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and


 

 
•
 
the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin.



below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

non-marketable equity investments

we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from
early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature
companies with established revenue streams and business models. the carrying value of our
non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.8 billion as
of june 26, 2010 ($3.4 billion as of december 26, 2009). the majority of this balance as of june
26, 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. our flash memory market
segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies, llc (imft) and im flash
singapore, llp (imfs) of $1.6 billion ($1.6 billion as of december 26, 2009). for further
information, see “note 10: non-marketable equity investments” in the notes to consolidated
condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method
of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable
equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed
balance sheets.

non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product
development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, other key business factors, and the ability
of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile. the
companies could fail, or not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they
may receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings.
these events could cause our investments to become impaired. in addition, financial market
volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through
liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. for further
information about our investment portfolio risks, see “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of this
form 10-q.

we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure
purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is
recognized. we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market
and income approaches. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of
comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance
multiples. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a
number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, development
stages, and other relevant factors. the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow
model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following
significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed
market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the
risk profile of comparable companies. estimates of market segment size, market segment share,
expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and/or intel using
historical data and available market data. the valuation of our non-marketable investments also
takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing
activities by the investees, the investees’ capital structure, and differences in seniority and
rights associated with the investees’ capital structure.

for non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment
and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that
impact the fair value of the investment, such as:




 
•
 
the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones
and overall business prospects;


 

 
•
 
the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;


 

 
•
 
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area,
including adverse regulatory or economic changes;


 

 
•
 
factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the
investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash;
and


 

 
•
 
the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.



if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is
other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes
assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before
disposal. if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the
investment to its fair value. impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $17 million in
the second quarter of 2010 ($63 million in the first half of 2010). over the past 12 quarters,
including the second quarter of 2010, impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from
$11 million to $896 million per quarter. this range included impairments of $896 million during the
fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in
clearwire communications, llc (clearwire llc).

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

imft/imfs

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand
products to intel and micron technology, inc. at manufacturing cost. we determine the fair value of
our investment in imft/imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business, which requires the use of
unobservable inputs. unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective
judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. changes in management
estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value
determination. we have not had an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in imft/imfs.
it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in
the near term, which could result in an impairment of our investment.

long-lived assets

we assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. factors that we
consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of
a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic
trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. we measure the
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying
value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash
flows. if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted
cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is measured by
comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. fair value
is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and
property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are recorded at fair value
only if an impairment charge is recognized.

impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of
identifiable independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of
our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the
independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective
judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor
manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the
assets’ new, shorter useful lives. over the past 12 quarters, including the second quarter of 2010,
impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $10 million to $300
million per quarter.

income taxes

we must make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement
purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and
deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from
differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement
purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant
changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a
subsequent period.

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery
is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we
will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated
condensed balance sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred
tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery
was not likely. recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans
with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s
plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for
taxes.

34



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we
determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step
requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to
estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we
re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors
such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively
settled issues. determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires
judgment. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax
benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

inventory

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
inventory that is not of saleable quality. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory
requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. the estimate of future demand is
compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. as of june 26, 2010, our work-in-process inventory totaled $1.6
billion and finished goods inventory totaled $1.3 billion. the demand forecast is included in the
development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation
and build decisions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation
process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products,
consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the
selling price in relation to the product cost. if our demand forecast for specific products is
greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be
required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.

in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine
normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings
of wafers compared to total available capacity. if the factory loadings are below the established
normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the
cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would
negatively impact our gross margin. we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. over the
past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter.

accounting changes and recent accounting standards

for a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected
dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated condensed financial
statements, see “note 2: accounting changes” and “note 3: recent accounting standards” in the notes
to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our net revenue for q2 2010 increased 34% compared to q2 2009. the increase was due to
significantly higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales, as well as higher microprocessor
average selling prices, compared to q2 2009. revenue in the japan, asia-pacific, americas, and
europe regions increased by 48%, 40%, 28%, and 12% respectively compared to q2 2009.

our overall gross margin dollars for q2 2010 increased $3.2 billion, or 77%, compared to q2 2009.
the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue, lower platform (microprocessor and
chipset) unit cost, excess capacity charges recorded in q2 2009, and lower start-up costs. our
overall gross margin percentage increased to 67.2% in q2 2010 from 50.8% in q2 2009. the
significant increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin
percentage increase in the pc client group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, the gross
margin percentage increase in the data center group operating segment. we derived a substantial
majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q2 2010 and q2 2009, from the sale of
microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group operating segments. see “business
outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by $1.8 billion, or 31%, in q2 2010 compared
to q2 2009. microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those designed for the notebook,
netbook, and desktop computing market segments. significantly higher notebook unit sales was the
primary driver of the increase in microprocessor revenue. to a lesser extent, higher desktop
microprocessor unit sales and higher notebook average selling prices also contributed to the
increase. the increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher
chipset unit sales.

operating income increased by $2.1 billion in q2 2010 compared to q2 2009. the increase in
operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. to a lesser extent, lower
platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit cost, excess capacity charges of approximately $315
million in q2 2009 that were primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets, and approximately
$150 million of lower start-up costs in q2 2010 compared to q2 2009 contributed to the increase.
these increases to operating income were partially offset by higher operating expenses.

data center group

net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by $630 million, or 42%, in q2 2010 compared to
q2 2009. the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly higher microprocessor unit
sales and higher microprocessor average selling prices. the increase in chipset, motherboard, and
other revenue was due to higher revenue from the sale of wired connectivity products and higher
chipset unit sales, partially offset by lower chipset average selling prices.

operating income increased by $630 million in q2 2010 compared to q2 2009. the increase in
operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. to a lesser extent, lower
start-up costs and lower chipset unit cost also contributed to the increase in operating income.

net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by $89 million, or 27%, in q2 2010
compared to q2 2009. the increase was primarily due to higher revenue within the embedded and
communications group (ecg) from significantly higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales,
partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices.

operating loss for the other ia operating segments decreased by $42 million in q2 2010 compared to
q2 2009. the operating loss decrease was primarily due to higher ecg revenue, partially offset by
higher ecg operating expenses.

research and development. r&d spending increased by $363 million, or 28%, in q2 2010 compared to
q2 2009 primarily due to higher process development costs and higher profit-dependent compensation.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased
$1.1 billion, or 41%, in q2 2010 compared to q2 2009 due to the q2 2009 charge of $1.447 billion
incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the european commission (ec). this decrease was
partially offset by higher advertising expenses, including cooperative advertising expenses, higher
profit-dependent compensation, and to a lesser extent, expenses related to our wind river software
group operating segment.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in q2
2010 (50% of net revenue in q2 2009).

recognized currency exchange rate losses in q2 2009 due to euro exposure related to our
euro-denominated liability for the ec fine. interest income was lower in q2 2010 compared to q2
2009 as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances.

the ec fine incurred in the second quarter of 2009 is not tax deductible. because there is no
reduction in our provision for taxes associated with the ec fine of $1.447 billion, it
significantly impacted our effective tax rate in q2 2009. the impact of the ec fine was partially
offset by a higher percentage of estimated profits in lower tax jurisdictions in q2 2009 as
compared to q2 2010, as well as the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to settlements
that positively impacted the q2 2009 rate.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our overall gross margin dollars for the first half of 2010 increased $6.4 billion, or 88%,
compared to the first half of 2009. the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue.
to a lesser extent, excess capacity charges recorded in the first half of 2009 and lower platform
(microprocessor and chipset) unit cost contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for the
first half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2009. our overall gross margin percentage
increased to 65.3% in the first half of 2010 from 48.2% in the first half of 2009. the significant
increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage
increase in the pc client group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, gross margin percentage
increases in the data center group and nand solutions group operating segments. we derived a
substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in the first half of 2010, and most of our
overall gross margin dollars in the first half of 2009, from the sale of microprocessors in the pc
client group and data center group operating segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of
gross margin expectations.

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by $4.2 billion, or 37%, in the first half of
2010 compared to the first half of 2009. microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those
designed for the notebook, netbook, and desktop computing market segments. significantly higher
notebook unit sales was the primary driver of the increase in microprocessor revenue. to a lesser
extent, higher desktop microprocessor unit sales and higher notebook average selling prices also
contributed to the increase. the increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to
significantly higher chipset unit sales.

operating income increased by $4.6 billion in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of
2009. the increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. during
the first half of 2009, we recorded excess capacity charges of approximately $940 million,
primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets. additionally, lower platform (microprocessor and
chipset) unit cost in the first half of 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income. these
increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses in the first half of 2010 compared to
the first half of 2009.

during the first half of 2010, we recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership
interest in numonyx. for further information, see “note 10: non-marketable equity investment” in
the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q. in addition, we
recognized lower equity method losses in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2009.
the two most significant components of our equity method losses, net were clearwire llc ($47
million loss in the first half of 2010 and $27 million loss in the first half of 2009) and numonyx
($42 million gain in the first half of 2010 and $37 million loss in the first half of 2009).

we recognized higher gains on sales, lower impairment charges on non-marketable equity investments,
and higher gains on other equity transactions in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half
of 2009. net gains on equity investments in the first half of 2010 included a gain of $67 million
on the q1 2010 sale of shares in micron. “other, net” for the first half of 2010 is primarily
related to fair value gains on the equity interest in micron we received from the sale of our
ownership interest in numonyx in q2 2010 and gains on equity options established prior to the
numonyx sale that economically hedge a portion of our micron equity interest.

we recognized $15 million of fair value losses on our marketable debt instruments classified as
trading assets in the first half of 2010 compared to $60 million of fair value gains in the first
half of 2009. interest income was lower in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of
2009 as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances.
the average interest rate earned during the first half of 2010 decreased by approximately 1.0
percentage point compared to the first half of 2009. in addition, we recognized currency exchange
rate losses in the first half of 2009 due to euro exposure related to our euro-denominated
liability for the ec fine.

the ec fine incurred in the second quarter of 2009 is not tax deductible. because there is no
reduction in our provision for taxes associated with the ec fine of $1.447 billion, it
significantly impacted our effective tax rate in the first half of 2009. the impact of the ec fine
was partially offset by a higher percentage of estimated profits in lower tax jurisdictions in the
first half of 2009 as compared to the first half of 2010, as well as the reversal of previously
accrued taxes related to settlements and effective settlements that positively impacted the rate in
the first half of 2009.

status of business outlook

we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with
investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking
statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q, including
any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. at the same time, we will
keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor
relations web site at www.intc.com. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook
published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we
publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the “business outlook” section and other
forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year
in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times.

from the close of business on august 27, 2010 until our quarterly earnings release is published,
presently scheduled for october 12, 2010, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet
period, the “business outlook” section and other forward-looking statements first published in our
form 8-k filed on july 13, 2010 and updated in our form 8-k filed on july 16, 2010, as reiterated
or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior
to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period, our representatives
will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. the exact timing
and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may
vary at our discretion.

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes
in assets and liabilities.

cash from operations for the first half of 2010 was $7.6 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion
compared to the first half of 2009 due to higher net income, partially offset by adjustments for
non-cash items. income taxes paid, net of refunds in the first half of 2010 compared to the first
half of 2009 were $2.1 billion higher on higher income before taxes in 2010.

changes in assets and liabilities as of june 26, 2010 compared to december 26, 2009 included the
following:




 
•
 
accrued compensation and benefits decreased due to payout of 2009 profit-dependent
compensation.


 

 
•
 
inventory increased due to higher microprocessor inventory.



for the first half of 2010, our two largest customers accounted for 38% of net revenue (39% for the
first half of 2009) with one of those customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue, and another
customer accounting for 17% of our net revenue. these two largest customers accounted for 41% of
net accounts receivable at june 26, 2010 and december 26, 2009.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(continued)

investing activities

the increase in cash used for investing activities in the first half of 2010, compared to the first
half of 2009, was due to an increase in net purchases of trading assets and available-for-sale
investments. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures due to the
timing of the ramp of our latest silicon process technology.

financing activities

the decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first half of 2010, compared to the first
half of 2009, was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sales of shares through employee
equity incentive plans, an increase in short-term debt (drafts payable) in the first half of 2010
compared to a decrease in short-term debt (drafts payable) in the first half of 2009, and proceeds
from government grants. these increases were partially offset by higher dividend payments and an
increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock.

liquidity

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. as of june 26, 2010, cash
and cash equivalents, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term
investments totaled $17.8 billion. in addition to the $17.8 billion, we have $4.7 billion in loans
receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio.

the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high, and we continue to be able to invest
in high-credit-quality investments. substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are
with a/a2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa-/aa3 or
better.

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing
authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the
issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the
first half of 2010 were $150 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of june
26, 2010. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of june
26, 2010. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to
which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next
12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test,
working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions
or strategic investments.

fair value of financial instruments

fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when
determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would
transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or
liability. see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of
this form 10-q.

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at
fair value on a recurring basis. when fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a
discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk and/or intel’s credit risk is factored into
the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(continued)

marketable debt instruments

as of june 26, 2010, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included
$21.5 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $2.0 billion was classified as
level 1, $18.9 billion as level 2, and $573 million as level 3.

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable
market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. management judgment was
required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market
to be considered active. our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments
generally takes into consideration activity of each individual instrument, including the number of
days each individual instrument trades.

of the $18.9 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on
a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 55% of the balance was classified as
level 2 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 45% due to the usage of
non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data.

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to
corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when
observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and
non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. all of our investments in
asset-backed securities were classified as level 3, and substantially all of them were valued using
non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market
data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities.

equity securities

as of june 26, 2010, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $1.6 billion of marketable equity securities (including marketable equity securities
receivable). of these securities, $783 million was classified as level 1 because the valuations
were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active
market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each
week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for individual securities, including the
number of days individual equity securities trade and the average weekly trading volume in relation
to the total outstanding shares of that security. the remaining marketable equity securities of
$767 million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices
for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions.
