item 2.  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe following supplements management's discussion and analysis of mastercard incorporated for the year ended december 31, 2016 as contained in the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 15, 2017.  it also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated (together, “mastercard” or the “company”), included elsewhere in this report.  percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.business overview mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  as the operator of what we believe is the world’s fastest payments network, we facilitate the switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) of payment transactions and deliver related products and services.  we make payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including mastercard®, maestro® and cirrus®.  we also provide value-added offerings such as safety and security products, information services and consulting, issuer and acquirer processing and loyalty and reward programs.  our network is designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.  a typical transaction on our network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder (an individual who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), merchant, issuer (the cardholder’s financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).  we do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our branded cards.  in most cases, cardholder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution customers.we generate revenue by charging fees to issuers, acquirers and other stakeholders for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services, as well as by assessing these customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or gross dollar volume (“gdv”), on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.our strategyour ability to grow our business is influenced by personal consumption expenditure growth, driving cash and check transactions toward electronic forms of payment, increasing our share in electronic payments and providing value-added products and services.  we achieve our strategy by growing, diversifying and building our business.grow.  we focus on growing our core businesses globally, including growing our consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions, increasing the number of payment transactions we switch.diversify.  we look to diversify our business and capabilities by focusing on:•diversifying our customer base in new and existing markets by working with partners such as governments, merchants, technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) and other businesses•encouraging use of our products and solutions in areas that provide new opportunities for electronic payments, such as transit, business-to-person transfers, business-to-business transfers and person-to-person transfers•capturing more payment flows by adding automated clearing house (ach) payments to our core card-based business via our recent acquisition of vocalink holdings limited (“vocalink”)•driving acceptance at merchants of all sizes•broadening financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked26table of contentsbuild.  we build our business by:•taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the evolving ways consumers interact and transact in the growing digital economy•providing value-added services across safety and security, consulting, data analytics and loyaltywe grow, diversify and build our business through a combination of organic growth and strategic investments, including acquisitions.strategic partners.  we work with a variety of stakeholders.  we provide financial institutions with solutions to help them increase revenue by driving preference for mastercard-branded products.  we help merchants by delivering data-driven insights and other services that help them grow and create simple and secure purchase experiences regardless of how and where their consumers shop.  we partner with technology companies such as digital players and mobile providers to deliver digital payment solutions powered by our technology, expertise and security protocols.  we help national and local governments drive increased financial inclusion and efficiency, reduce costs, increase transparency to reduce crime and corruption and advance social programs.   for consumers, we provide better, safer and more convenient ways to pay.business environment we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies.  net revenue generated in the united states was 36% of total net revenue for both the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 and 39% for both the three and six months ended june 30, 2016.  no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total net revenue in each period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time.  while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, currency fluctuations, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate.  certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  in addition, political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  as a result, our revenue or results of operations may be negatively impacted.  we continue to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry.  notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for us to grow our business.for a full discussion of the various legal, regulatory and business risks that could impact our financial results, see “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december

special items and/or foreign currency.  see “non-gaap financial information” for further information on the special items, the impact of foreign currency and the reconciliation to gaap reported amounts.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, we recorded net income of $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion, an increase of 20% and 16%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, earnings per diluted share was $1.10 and $2.09, an increase of 24% and 19%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016. excluding the impact of the special items (see “non-gaap financial information”), adjusted net income increased 11% and 12%, or 12% and 13% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  in addition, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, adjusted diluted 28table of contentsearnings per share increased 15% for both periods, or 16% and 15% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  key highlights for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 were as follows:•net revenue increased 13% for both periods, or 14% and 13% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016, primarily driven by increases across our revenue categories and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives.  switched transactions increased 17% for both periods, gross dollar volume increased 9% and 8%, on a local currency basis and adjusted for the impact of the eu regulation change, and cross-border volume increased 14% and 13%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016. •operating expenses increased 7% and 9% versus the comparable periods in 2016.  excluding the impact of the special items, adjusted operating expenses increased 16% and 13%, or 17% and 14% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  these increases were primarily due to our continued investment in strategic initiatives, the impact of acquisitions and higher foreign exchange activity losses. •the effective income tax rate was 27.7% and 27.3% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, respectively, versus 28.0% and 28.1% for the comparable periods in 2016.  the lower effective tax rates, as compared to the prior year, were due to a more favorable geographical mix of taxable earnings, partially offset by a lower u.s. foreign tax credit benefit associated with the repatriation of current year foreign earnings. other financial highlights for the six months ended june 30, 2017 were as follows:•we generated net cash flows from operations of $2.0 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the comparable period in 2016.•we repurchased 16.6 million shares and paid dividends of $474 million.non-gaap financial informationnon-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (“gaap”).  these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of the following special items (“special items”):•in the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a provision for litigation of $15 million ($10 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) related to a litigation settlement with canadian merchants (the “canadian merchant litigation provision”).•in the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a provision for litigation of $107 million ($78 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to a judgment issued against the company in a litigation with a merchant in the u.k. (the “u.k. merchant litigation provision”).  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item i of this report for further discussion.  we excluded these litigation provisions because our management monitors litigation judgments and settlements related to interchange and regulation separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. in addition, we present growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-gaap financial measure.  currency-neutral growth rates, are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results.  the impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.  the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  our management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency provides relevant information.29table of contentsour management believes that the non-gaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  our management uses non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.  the presentation of non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap.30table of contentsnet revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the special item and/or the impact of foreign currency are non-gaap financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with gaap.  the following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap to the respective non-gaap adjusted financial measures.           six months

translational and transactional impact.31table of contentsimpact of foreign currency ratesour overall operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency.  the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives.  in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currencies.  for example, our billing in australia is in the u.s. dollar; however, consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar.  the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our u.s. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated.  the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis.  for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, gdv on a u.s. dollar-converted basis increased 4% for both periods, while gdv on a local currency basis increased 6% and 5%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  further, the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency.in addition, we incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts (“foreign exchange activity”).  the impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results (see “non-gaap financial information”) and is recorded in general and administrative expenses.  we attempt to manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through our foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.  since we do not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, we record gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize.we are exposed to currency devaluation in certain countries.  in addition, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of financial assets into u.s. dollars.  while these revenues and assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis, they could be negatively impacted should there be a continued and sustained devaluation of local currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and/or a continued and sustained deterioration of economic conditions in these countries.  this includes approximately $130 million of exposure in venezuela as of june 30, 2017.financial resultsrevenuerevenue descriptionour business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders’ financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions).  our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services.  our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers.  our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro, brazilian real and the british pound.the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers.  our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following:•domestic or cross-border transactions•signature-based or pin-based transactions32table of contents•geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs•volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates•processed or not processed by mastercard•amount of usage of our other products or services•amount of rebates and incentives provided to customerswe classify our net revenue into the following five categories:1.domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same.  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.2.cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different.  in general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and may include fees for currency conversion.3.transaction processing revenue is earned for both domestic and cross-border transactions and is primarily based on the number of transactions.  transaction processing includes the following:•switched transactions include the following products and services:øauthorization is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval.  in certain circumstances, such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, mastercard or others, on behalf of the issuer approve in accordance with either the issuer’s instructions or applicable rules (also known as “stand-in”).øclearing is the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  we clear transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.øsettlement is facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.•connectivity fees are charged to issuers, acquirers and other financial institutions for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages.  these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted  and the number of connections to our network.•other processing fees include issuer and acquirer processing solutions; payment gateways for e-commerce merchants; and mobile gateways for mobile initiated transactions.  4.other revenues: other revenues consist of other payment-related products and services and are primarily associated with the following:•consulting, data analytic and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, our professional advisory services group.•safety and security services fees are for products and services we offer to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and to ensure the safety of transactions made on mastercard products.  we work with issuers, merchants and governments to help deploy standards for safe and secure transactions for the global payments system. •loyalty and rewards solutions fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with mastercard-branded cards, such as access to a global airline lounge network, global and local concierge services, individual insurance coverages, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advance services and a 24-hour cardholder service center.  for merchants, we provide targeted offers 33table of contentsand rewards campaigns and management services for publishing offers, as well as opportunities for holders of co-brand or loyalty cards and rewards program members to obtain rewards points faster.•program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.•bank account-based payment services relating to ach and other ach related services.•we also charge for a variety of other payment-related products and services, including account and transaction enhancement services, rules compliance and publications.5.rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue.revenue analysisin the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, gross revenue increased 16% and 15%, or 16% for both periods on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  gross revenue growth in the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 was driven by an increase in transactions, dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, other payment-related products and services and the impact of acquisitions.  rebates and incentives, in the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, increased 21% and 22%, or 22% for both periods on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016, primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.  our net revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, increased 13% for both periods, or 14% and 13% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points and 1 percentage point to net revenue growth for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, respectively.the following table provides a summary of the trend in volume and transaction growth. three months ended june

generated by maestro and cirrus cards.in 2016, our gdv was impacted by the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments, which became effective in june 2016.  the regulation requires that we no longer collect fees on domestic european economic area payment transactions that do not use our network brand.  prior to that, we collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries, particularly france, on transactions with mastercard co-badged cards if the brands of domestic networks (as opposed to mastercard) were used.  as a result, the non-mastercard co-badged volume is no longer being included.34table of contentsthe following table reflects gdv growth rates for europe and worldwide mastercard.  for comparability purposes, we adjusted growth rates for the impact of article 8 of the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments, to exclude the prior period co-badged volume processed by other networks. three months ended june 30, six months ended june

customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue.  in addition, as part of our business strategy, mastercard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers.  these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances.  see our risk factor in “risk factor - business risks” in part i, item 1a of our annual report on form 10-k for the year

comprised of general and administrative, advertising and marketing, depreciation and amortization and provision for litigation settlement.  operating expenses increased 7% and 9% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  excluding the impact of the special items, adjusted operating expenses increased 16% and 13%, or 17% and 14% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  these increases were primarily due to our continued investment in strategic initiatives, the impact of acquisitions and higher foreign exchange activity losses. 36table of contentsthe components of operating expenses for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017

sum due to rounding.** not meaningful.the primary drivers of changes in general and administrative expenses for three and six months ended june 30, 2017 versus the comparable periods in 2016 were:•personnel expenses increased 17% and 16%, or 18% and 16% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  acquisitions contributed 5 and 3 percentage points to personnel expense growth for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, respectively.  in addition, the increase was due to a higher number of employees to support our continued investment in the areas of digital, geographic expansion and advisors capabilities. •data processing and telecommunication expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other telecommunication systems.  the increase is due to capacity growth of our business.  •foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  see note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 for further discussion.  foreign exchange activity negatively impacted general and administrative expense growth by 5 and 2 percentage points for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2016.  the increase was driven by the mark-to-market losses from foreign exchange derivative contracts due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar, as well as balance sheet remeasurement losses, primarily due to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar.•other expenses include costs to provide loyalty and rewards solutions, travel and meeting expenses and rental expense for our facilities.  other expenses decreased for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, versus the comparable periods in 2016, primarily due to the lapping of costs related to a customer dispute in the prior year and lower loyalty costs, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.   advertising and marketingour brands, principally mastercard, are valuable strategic assets that drive acceptance and usage of our products and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally.  our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotions, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale.  we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences.  advertising and marketing expenses increased 16% and 20%, or 17% and 21% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, versus the comparable periods in 2016, due to higher marketing spend primarily related to masterpass.depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expenses increased 18% and 8%, or 19% and 9% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, versus the comparable periods in 2016, primarily due to acquisitions which contributed 38table of contents16 and 8 percentage points to depreciation and amortization growth for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, respectively.provision for litigation settlementin the first quarter of 2017, we recorded the canadian merchant litigation provision of $15 million.  in the second quarter of 2016, we recorded the u.k. merchant litigation provision of $107 million.  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion.other income (expense)other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses.  total other income (expense) increased $10 million and $27 million for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, versus the comparable periods in 2016, primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in november 2016, partially offset by higher investment income.income taxes the effective income tax rate was 27.7% and 27.3% for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017, respectively, versus 28.0% and 28.1% for the comparable periods in 2016.  the lower effective tax rates, as compared to the prior year, were due to a more favorable geographical mix of taxable earnings, partially offset by a lower u.s. foreign tax credit benefit associated with the repatriation of current year foreign earnings.  liquidity and capital resourceswe rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.  the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us at june 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016: june 30, 2017 december 31, 2016 (in billions)cash, cash equivalents and investments 1$7.0 $8.3unused line of credit3.8 3.81 investments include available-for-sale securities and short-term held-to-maturity securities.  at june 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016, this amount excludes restricted cash related to the u.s. merchant class litigation settlement of $544 million and $543 million, respectively.  this amount also excludes restricted security deposits held for customers of $993 million and $991 million at june 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively.cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $3.8 billion both at june 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016, or 55% and 45%, respectively, as of such dates.  it is our present intention to indefinitely reinvest historic undistributed accumulated earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings.  if these earnings are needed for u.s. operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states, we would be required to record a liability for such u.s. taxes for the historic undistributed accumulated earnings at that time.  such taxes would be due upon repatriation of such earnings to the united states.our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  we guarantee the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers.  see note 12 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part i, item 1 of this report for further information of these guarantees.  historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of potential future losses.  the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see part i, item 39table of contents1a - risk factors of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016; note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report; and
