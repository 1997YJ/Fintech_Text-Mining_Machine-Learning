overview of our performance
and operating environment

our
business

we are a
global, research-based company applying innovative science to improve world
health. our efforts in support of that purpose include the discovery,
development, manufacture and marketing of safe and effective medicines; the
exploration of ideas that advance the frontiers of science and medicine; and the
support of programs dedicated to illness prevention, health and wellness, and
increased access to quality healthcare. our value proposition is to demonstrate
that our medicines can effectively prevent and treat disease, including the
associated symptoms and suffering, and can form the basis for an overall
improvement in healthcare systems and their related costs. our revenues are
derived from the sale of our products, as well as through alliance agreements,
under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies.

on january
26, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement under
which we will acquire wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction valued on that date
at $50.19 per share, or a total of $68 billion. while we have taken actions and
incurred costs associated with the pending transaction that are reflected in our
financial statements, the acquisition of wyeth will not be reflected in our
financial statements until consummation. (see also the “our strategic
initiatives – strategy and recent transactions” and “costs and expenses –
acquisition-related costs” sections of this md&a).

our first quarter
performance

revenues in the first quarter
of 2009 decreased 8% to $10.9 billion, compared to the same period in 2008. the
significant product and alliance revenue impacts on revenues for the first
quarter of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, are as
follows:

lipitor
      has been impacted by competitive pressures and other factors.



(b)


zyrtec/zyrtec
      d lost u.s. exclusivity in late january 2008, at which time we ceased
      selling this product. camptosar lost u.s. exclusivity in february
      2008.









(c)


chantix/champix
      has been negatively impacted by the changes to its label in
      2008.








(d)


norvasc
      lost u.s. exclusivity in march
2007.





foreign
exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $640 million, or 5%,
compared to the first quarter of 2008.

in the
u.s., revenues decreased 10% compared to the first quarter 2008, while
international revenues decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of
2008.

the impact
of rebates in the first quarter of 2009 decreased revenues by approximately $950
million, compared to approximately $900 million in the first quarter of 2008.
the increase in rebates was due primarily to the impact of our contracting
strategies with both government and non-government entities in the u.s.
(see
further discussion in the “revenues – pharmaceutical business revenues” section
of this md&a).






24









income from continuing operations
for the first quarter of 2009 was $2.7 billion, compared to $2.8 billion
in the first quarter of 2008. the decrease was primarily due to:





·


the
      decrease in total revenues due to the unfavorable impact of foreign
      exchange, among other factors;









·


the
      decrease in other
income/deductions;









·


the
      increase in the effective tax rate;
and









·


costs
      incurred in connection with the pending wyeth
  acquisition;





partially
offset by:





·


savings
      related to our cost-reduction initiatives;
and









·


the
      elimination of acquisition-related
      in-process research and development charges in 2009 compared
      to $398 million








 
      


in
      the first quarter of 2008.





in the
first quarter of 2008, we expensed acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (ipr&d) related to our acquisitions
of covx and coley pharmaceutical group, inc. related to our pharmaceutical
segment and two smaller acquisitions related to our animal health segment. (see
further discussion in the “our strategic initiatives – strategy and recent
transactions: acquisitions, licensing and collaborations” section of this
md&a.) as a result of adopting financial accounting standards board
statement of financial accounting standards no. 141r, business combinations, as
amended, beginning january 1, 2009, ipr&d related to future acquisitions
will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived
intangible assets. we made no acquisitions in the first quarter of
2009.

we have
also made significant progress with our cost-reduction and transformation
initiatives, launched in early 2005, which are broad-based, company-wide efforts
to improve performance and efficiency. (see further discussion in the “our
cost-reduction initiatives” section of this md&a.)

our operating
environment

while the
global recession has affected our business, the impact so far has been
consistent with the expectations reflected in our financial guidance for 2009
(see the “outlook” section of this md&a.) the impact on our human
pharmaceutical business has been largely in the u.s. market, where health
insurers and benefit plans are imposing formulary restrictions in favor of
generics, which is affecting products such as lipitor, lyrica, celebrex, and
geodon; in addition patients, experiencing the effects of the weak economy and
facing increases in co-pays, are sometimes delaying treatments or skipping doses
to reduce their costs. our animal health business also has been impacted by the
recession, which has adversely affected global spending on veterinary
care.

despite
the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position.
we have a strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity that provides us with
financial flexibility. our long-term debt is rated high quality and investment
grade by both standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service. as market
conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have and
will continue to take a conservative approach to our investments. both
short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly
liquid, well-diversified, investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities.
as a result, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our
financing needs for the foreseeable future. (for further discussion of our
financial condition, see the “financial condition, liquidity and capital
resources” section of this md&a.)

in
addition to general economic conditions, we and other pharmaceutical companies
continue to face significant industry-specific challenges in a profoundly
changing business environment, as explained more fully in pfizer’s annual report
on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2008. industry-wide factors,
including pharmaceutical product pricing and access, intellectual property
rights, product competition, the regulatory environment, pipeline productivity
and the changing business environment, can significantly impact our businesses.
in order to meet these challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the
marketplace, we are taking steps to change the way we operate our pharmaceutical
and other businesses. effective january 1, 2009, we changed our operating model
within the pharmaceutical segment, which is now comprised of five
customer-focused units—primary care, specialty care, oncology, established
products and emerging markets—with clear, single points of accountability to
enable the segment to more effectively anticipate and respond to the diverse
needs of physicians, customers and patients. as in the past, the pharmaceutical
segment continues to be managed inclusive of our research and manufacturing
organizations and supported by administrative functions.






25









generic
competition and patent expirations significantly impact our business. we lost
u.s. exclusivity for camptosar in february 2008 and norvasc in march 2007 and,
as expected, significant revenue declines followed. zyrtec/zyrtec d lost its
u.s. exclusivity in late january 2008, at which time we ceased selling this
product. lipitor began to face competition in the u.s. in 2006 from generic
pravastatin (pravachol) and generic simvastatin (zocor), in addition to other
competitive pressures. the volume of patients who start on or switch to generic
simvastatin continues to negatively impact lipitor prescribing trends,
particularly in the managed-care environment.

we will
continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasing incidents
of infringement whenever appropriate. (for more detailed information about
lipitor, norvasc, zyrtec, camptosar and other significant products, see further
discussion in the “revenues – pharmaceutical – selected product descriptions”
section of this md&a). (see part ii – other information; item 1.
legal proceedings, of
this form 10-q for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to
patent litigation.)

these and
other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered
along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors
that may affect future results” section of this md&a.

our strategic initiatives –
strategy and recent transactions

acquisitions,
licensing and collaborations

we are
committed to capitalizing on new growth opportunities by advancing our
new-product pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well
as through opportunistic licensing, co-promotion agreements and acquisitions.
our business-development strategy targets a number of growth opportunities,
including biologics, vaccines, oncology, diabetes, alzheimer’s disease,
inflammation/immunology, pain, psychoses (schizophrenia) and other products and
services that seek to provide valuable healthcare solutions. some of our most
significant business-development transactions during the first quarter of 2009
and 2008 are described below:





·


in
      the first quarter of 2009, we entered into a five-year agreement with
      bausch & lomb to co-promote prescription pharmaceuticals in the u.s.
      for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions.  the agreement
      covers prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, including our xalatan
      product and bausch & lomb’s alrex®, lotemax® and zylet® products, as
      well as bausch & lomb’s investigational anti-infective eye drop,
      besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%, which is currently under review
      by the u.s. food and drug administration
(fda).









·


in
      the first quarter of 2008, we acquired covx, a privately held
      biotherapeutics company specializing in preclinical oncology and metabolic
      research and the developer of a biotherapeutics technology platform that
      we expect will enhance our biologic portfolio. also in the first quarter
      of 2008, we acquired all the outstanding shares of coley pharmaceutical
      group, inc. (coley), a biopharmaceutical company specializing in vaccines
      and drug candidates designed to fight cancers, allergy and asthma
      disorders, and autoimmune diseases, for approximately $230 million. in
      connection with these and two smaller acquisitions related to animal
      health, we recorded approximately $398 million in acquisition-related in-process
      research and development
charges.





the
following transactions were not completed as of the end of the first quarter of
2009, and our consolidated financial statements as of march 29, 2009 do not
assume their completion. however, we have incurred costs related to the pending
acquisition of wyeth that are reflected in our financial
statements.





·


on
      april 16, 2009, we announced that we entered into an agreement with
      glaxosmithkline plc (gsk) to create a new company focused solely on
      research, development and commercialization of hiv medicines. we and gsk
      will contribute product and pipeline assets to the new company. the new
      company will have a broad product portfolio of 11 marketed products,
      including innovative leading therapies such as gsk’s combivir and kivexa products and our selzentry/celsentri
      (maraviroc) product. the company will have a pipeline of six
      innovative and targeted medicines, including four compounds in phase 2
      development. the new company will contract r&d and manufacturing
      services directly from gsk and us and will also enter into a new research
      alliance agreement with gsk and us. under this new alliance, the new
      company will invest in our and gsk’s programs for discovery research and
      development into hiv medicines. the new company will have exclusive rights
      of first negotiation in relation to any new hiv-related medicines
      developed by either gsk or us. we will initially hold a 15% equity
      interest in the new company, and gsk will hold an 85% equity interest. the
      equity interests will be adjusted in the event that specified sales and
      regulatory milestones are achieved. our equity interest in the new company
      could vary from 9% to 30.5%, and gsk’s equity interest in the new company
      could vary from 69.5% to 91%, depending upon the milestones achieved with
      respect to the original pipeline assets contributed by us and by gsk to
      the new company. each company may also be entitled to preferential
      dividend payments to the extent that specific sales thresholds are met in
      respect of the marketed products and pipeline assets originally
      contributed. we will account for our share of the new company as an equity
      method investment. the closing of
      the transaction and commencement of the new company’s business is
      conditional upon certain matters, including receiving certain regulatory
      and tax clearances, and no material adverse change occurring in respect of
      either gsk’s or our
      hiv business prior to closing. we and gsk will conduct consultations with
      works councils in accordance with applicable employment legislation. the
      transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of
      2009.

·


on
      january 26, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger
      agreement under which we will acquire wyeth in a cash-and-stock
      transaction valued on that date at $50.19 per share, or a total of $68
      billion. the boards of directors of both pfizer and wyeth have approved
      the transaction. under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding
      share of wyeth common stock will be converted into the right to receive
      $33 in cash and 0.985 of a share of pfizer common stock, subject to
      adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement. each outstanding wyeth
      stock option, and each outstanding share of wyeth restricted stock,
      deferred stock unit award and restricted stock unit award, will be
      exchanged for cash in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
      in addition, the merger agreement provides that each share of wyeth $2
      convertible preferred stock will be exchanged for a newly created class of
      pfizer preferred stock having substantially the same rights as the wyeth
      $2 convertible preferred stock. however, on april 23, 2009, wyeth
      announced that it will affect a full redemption of its outstanding $2
      convertible preferred stock effective on july 15, 2009. as a result, we
      will not issue any preferred stock in connection with the
      merger.



 
 


 
we
      expect the wyeth transaction will close at the end of the third quarter or
      during the fourth quarter of 2009, subject to wyeth shareholder approval,
      governmental and regulatory approvals, the satisfaction of the conditions
      related to the debt financing for the transaction, and other usual and
      customary closing conditions. we believe that the combination of pfizer
      and wyeth will create the world’s premier biopharmaceutical company and
      will meaningfully deliver on pfizer’s strategic priorities in a single
      transaction.  the combined entity will be one of the most
      diversified in the industry and will enable us to offer patients a
      uniquely broad and diversified portfolio of biopharmaceutical innovation
      through patient-centric units.


 
 


 
we
      expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $4 billion by the
      end of 2012 related solely to this transaction. we expect we will incur
      acquisition-related restructuring charges and integration costs associated
      with the expected cost savings, which we estimate could be in the range of
      approximately $6 billion to $8 billion, and which will be expensed as
      incurred.


 
 


 

we
      expect to fund the acquisition through a combination of cash, stock,
      short-term borrowings and long-term debt. (see notes to condensed
      consolidated financial statements - note 8b. financial
      instruments: short-term borrowings, note 8c. financial instruments: long-term
      debt and note 8g. financial
      instruments: credit covenants.)



 
 


 

the
      merger agreement with wyeth prohibits us from making acquisitions, except
      for acquisitions for which cash consideration does not exceed $750 million
      in the aggregate prior to the completion of the transaction without
      wyeth’s consent. in addition, the 364-day bridge term loan credit
      agreement that we entered into on march 12, 2009 (bridge credit agreement)
      in connection with the pending wyeth acquisition prohibits us from
      purchasing u.s. domestic businesses for cash consideration in excess of
      $500 million in the aggregate or international businesses for cash
      consideration in excess of $2.5 billion in the aggregate until the
      commitment expires or is terminated and all loans under the agreement, if
      any, have been paid. (for further discussion of the bridge credit
      agreement, see the “financial condition, liquidity and capital resources”
      section of this md&a and notes to the condensed consolidated financial
      statements – note 8b.
      financial instruments: short-term borrowings and note 8g. financial
      instruments: credit
covenants).






 
our cost-reduction
initiatives

during
2008, we completed the cost-reduction and transformation initiatives that were
launched in early 2005, broadened in october 2006 and expanded in january 2007.
these initiatives were designed to increase efficiency and streamline
decision-making across the company and change the way we run our businesses to
meet the challenges of a changing business environment, as well as take
advantage of the diverse opportunities in the marketplace.

we have
generated net cost reductions through site rationalization in r&d and
manufacturing, streamlining organizational structures, sales force and staff
function reductions, and increased outsourcing and procurement savings. these
and other actions have allowed us to reduce costs in support services and
facilities.






27









on january
26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new cost-reduction initiative
that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs of
approximately $3 billion, based on the actual foreign exchange rates in effect
during 2008, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total costs. we
expect that this program will be completed by the end of 2010, with full savings
to be realized by the end of 2011. we plan to reinvest approximately $1 billion
of these savings in the business, resulting in an expected $2 billion net
decrease compared to our 2008 adjusted total costs. (for an understanding of
adjusted income, see the “adjusted income” section of this
md&a.)

as part of
this new cost-reduction initiative, we intend to reduce our total worldwide
workforce by approximately 10%.  reductions will span sales,
manufacturing, research and development, and administrative organizations. in
the first quarter of 2009, we reduced our workforce by approximately 1,650
colleagues. this decline was net of new colleagues hired in expanding areas of
our business, primarily in emerging markets. we also intend to reduce our
facilities square footage by approximately 15%. we expect to incur costs related
to this new cost-reduction initiative of approximately $6 billion, pre-tax, of
which $1.5 billion was recorded in 2008 and $331 million was recorded in the
first quarter of 2009.

projects
in various stages of implementation include:

pfizer
global research and development (pgrd)





·


creating a more agile and
      productive organization—in january 2009, we announced that we plan
      to reduce our global research staff. we expect these reductions, which are
      part of the planned 10% total workforce reduction discussed above, will be
      completed during 2009.





after a
review of all our therapeutic areas, in 2008, we announced our decision to exit
certain disease areas—anemia, atherosclerosis/hyperlipidemia, bone
health/frailty, gastrointestinal, heart failure, liver fibrosis, muscle,
obesity, osteoarthritis (disease-modifying concepts only) and peripheral
arterial disease—and give higher priority to the following disease areas:
alzheimer's disease, diabetes, inflammation/immunology, oncology, pain and
psychoses (schizophrenia). we also will continue to work in many other disease
areas, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, genitourinary,
infectious diseases, ophthalmology, smoking cessation, thrombosis and
transplant, among others. with a smaller, more focused research portfolio, we
will be able to devote our resources to the most valuable opportunities. these
decisions did not affect our portfolio of marketed products, the development of
compounds then in phase 3 or any launches planned over the next three
years.

we
continue to focus on reduced cycle time and improved compound survival in the
drug discovery and development process. over the next two years, we expect to
see a 25% to 33% reduction in cycle time in the period from final approved
protocol to last subject-first visit, as new processes and procedures are
adopted for newly initiated phase 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. in the past couple
of years, a number of steps have been taken to improve compound survival, such
as rigorous analyses of the successful and unsuccessful projects in the entire
portfolio to ensure that results are captured and applied to ongoing programs
and to portfolio decisions.

pfizer
global manufacturing (pgm)





·


supply network transformation - we are
      transforming our global manufacturing network into a global strategic
      supply network, consisting of our internal network of plants together with
      strategic external manufacturers, and including purchasing, packaging and
      distribution. as of the end of the first quarter of 2009, we have reduced
      our internal network of plants from 93 in 2003 to 46, which includes the
      acquisition of seven plants and the sites sold in 2006 as part of our
      consumer healthcare business. we plan to reduce our internal network of
      plants around the world to 41. we expect that the cumulative impact will
      be a more focused, streamlined and competitive manufacturing operation,
      with less than 50% of our former internal plants and more than 53% fewer
      manufacturing employees, compared to 2003. as part of the transformation
      to a global strategic supply network, we currently expect to increase
      outsourced manufacturing from approximately 24% of our products, on a cost
      basis, to approximately 30% over the next two
  years.




 

worldwide
pharmaceutical operations (wpo)

 




·


reorganization of our field
      force - as part of pfizer’s overall restructuring into smaller,
      more focused business units, we have changed our global field force
      operations to enable us to adapt to changing market dynamics and respond
      to local customer needs more quickly and with more flexibility. this
      process, which began in 2007, is generating savings from de-layering,
      eliminating duplicative work, and utilizing our sales representatives more
      efficiently through targeted deployment based on sophisticated
      segmentation analyses, offset modestly by increased investment in certain
      emerging markets. between 2004 and the end of the first quarter of 2009,
      we reduced our global field force by approximately 12%, with a substantial
      portion of those reductions occurring since the beginning of
      2007.

pharmaceutical business
revenues

 
worldwide
pharmaceutical revenues for the first quarter of 2009 were $10.1 billion, a
decrease of 7% compared to the first quarter of 2008, primarily due
to:





·


the
      strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily
      the euro, uk pound and canadian dollar, which unfavorably impacted
      pharmaceutical revenues by $574 million, or 5%, in the first quarter of
      2009;









·


an
      aggregate decrease in revenues for zyrtec/zyrtec d and camptosar of $200
      million in the first quarter of 2009, due to the loss of u.s. exclusivity
      and cessation of selling of zyrtec/zyrtec d in january 2008 and the loss
      of u.s. exclusivity of camptosar in february
  2008;









·


a
      decrease in worldwide revenues for lipitor of $416 million in the first
      quarter of 2009, primarily resulting from competitive pressures from
      generics, among other factors; and









·


a
      decrease in worldwide revenues for chantix/champix of $100 million in the
      first quarter of 2009, primarily resulting from changes to the chantix
      label during 2008, among other
factors;





partially
offset by:





·


solid
      operational performance from certain products, including lyrica,
      xalatan/xalacom, zyvox, sutent and
vfend.





geographically,






·


in
      the u.s., pharmaceutical revenues decreased 8% in the first quarter of
      2009, compared to the same period of 2008, primarily due to lower sales of
      lipitor, the effect of the loss of exclusivity of zyrtec/zyrtec d and
      camptosar, and lower sales of chantix, which was negatively impacted by
      the changes to its label in 2008 and other factors, partially offset by
      the solid performance from certain products, including lyrica, viagra,
      zyvox and xalatan; and



 
 








·


in
      our international markets, pharmaceutical revenues decreased 7% in the
      first quarter of 2009, compared to the same period of 2008, due to the
      unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on international revenues of $574
      million, or 10%, partially offset by operational growth, including higher
      revenues from certain products, including lyrica, zyvox and
      sutent.





 






29









during the
first quarter of 2009, international pharmaceutical revenues grew to represent
53.4% of total pharmaceutical revenues, compared to 52.9% in the first quarter
of 2008. this increase reflects the slightly higher percentage decline in
pharmaceutical revenues in the u.s. compared to international markets, where
overall operational growth partially offset the adverse impact of foreign
exchange.

effective
january 3, 2009, august 1, 2008, may 2, 2008 and january 1, 2008, we increased
the published prices for certain u.s. pharmaceutical products. these price
increases had no material effect on wholesaler inventory levels in comparison to
the prior year.

as is
typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a
variety of deductions, that are generally estimated and recorded in the same
period that the revenues are recognized, and primarily represent rebates and
discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and managed care
organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. these deductions
represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, judgment and
knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the
impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our
overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results
generally have been less than 1% of pharmaceutical net sales and can result in
either a net increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate
charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual
product growth trends.

rebates
under medicaid and related state programs reduced revenues by $150 million in
the first quarter of 2009, compared to $178 million in the first quarter of
2008. the decreases in rebates under medicaid and related state programs were
due primarily to lower sales of zyrtec/zyrtec d and zoloft, which have lost
exclusivity in the u.s.

rebates
under medicare reduced revenues by $230 million in the first quarter of 2009,
compared to $221 million in the first quarter of 2008. the increase in medicare
rebates was due primarily to a shift in the mix of lipitor sales volume toward
medicare plans with higher rates.

performance-based
contract rebates reduced revenues by $573 million in the first quarter of 2009,
compared to $506 million in the first quarter of 2008. the increases in
performance-based contract rebates were due primarily to the impact of certain
contract changes which resulted in increased rates related to lipitor, partially
offset by lower sales of zyrtec/zyrtec d, viagra and caduet. these contracts are
with managed care customers, including health maintenance organizations and
pharmacy benefit managers, who receive rebates based on the achievement of
contracted performance terms for products. rebates are product-specific and,
therefore, for any given period are impacted by the mix of products
sold.

chargebacks
(primarily reimbursements to wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third
parties) reduced revenues by $486 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared
to $507 million in the first quarter of 2008. chargebacks were impacted by the
launch of certain generic products.

our
accruals for medicaid and related state programs rebates, medicare rebates,
performance-based contract rebates and chargebacks totaled $1.7 billion as of
march 29, 2009, an increase from $1.5 billion as of december 31, 2008, due
primarily to the impact of certain contract changes and increased pricing
pressures.

lipitor, for the
      treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood, is the most
      widely used prescription treatment for lowering cholesterol and the
      best-selling pharmaceutical product of any kind in the world. lipitor
      recorded worldwide revenues of $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2009,
      a decrease of 13% compared to the same period in 2008. these results
      reflect the negative impact of foreign exchange, which decreased revenues
      by $186 million, or 6%. in the u.s., revenues of $1.5 billion in the first
      quarter of 2009 declined 17%, compared with the same period in 2008.
      internationally, lipitor revenues in the first quarter of 2009 decreased
      9%, compared to the same period in 2008, with 13% due to the unfavorable
      impact of foreign exchange.





the
decrease in lipitor worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2009 compared to
the same period in 2008, was driven by a combination of factors, including the
following:





·


the
      unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange;









·


the
      impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition
      from multi-source generic simvastatin and branded products in the
      u.s.;









·


increased

norvasc, for treating
      hypertension, lost exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2007. norvasc has also
      experienced patent expirations in most other major markets, with the
      exception of canada, where the amlodipine besylate patent expires in 2010.
      norvasc worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2009 decreased 6%
      compared to the same period in
2008.

chantix/champix, the
      first new prescription treatment to aid smoking cessation in nearly a
      decade, became available to patients in the u.s. in august 2006 and in
      select eu markets in december 2006 and has been launched in all major
      markets. chantix/champix has been prescribed to more than ten million
      patients globally since its launch. chantix/ champix recorded worldwide
      revenues of $177 million in the first quarter of 2009, a decrease of 36%,
      compared to the same period in 2008. in the u.s., revenues of $112 million
      in the first quarter of 2009 declined 42% compared to the same period in
      2008, following changes to the chantix label in 2008 and other factors.
      internationally, revenues of $65 million in the first quarter of 2009
      decreased 22% compared to the same period in 2008, following the label
      changes and reflecting the negative impact of foreign exchange, which
      decreased revenues by 14%.





in january
2008, we added a warning to chantix’s label that patients who are attempting to
quit smoking by taking chantix should be observed by a physician for
neuropsychiatric symptoms like changes in behavior, agitation, depressed mood,
suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. a causal relationship between chantix
and these reported symptoms has not been established. there are also confounding
factors that limit interpretation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in smokers. for
example, quitting smoking has been associated with symptoms of nicotine
withdrawal, such as depressed mood and anxiety. in addition, research has shown
that smokers have a higher rate of depression and suicide-related events than
non-smokers.
 
in may
2008, we updated the chantix label to provide further guidance about the safe
use of chantix. the updated label advises that patients should stop taking
chantix and contact their healthcare provider immediately if agitation,
depressed mood, or changes in behavior that are not typical for them are
observed, or if they develop suicidal thoughts or suicidal
behavior.

u.s.
prescription trends and u.s. revenues for chantix have declined year-over-year
following the changes to the product’s label in the u.s. and other factors. we
are continuing our educational and promotional efforts, which are focused on the
chantix benefit-risk proposition, the significant health consequences of smoking
and the importance of the physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit
smoking.

caduet, a single-pill
      therapy combining norvasc and lipitor, recorded worldwide revenues of $134
      million, a decrease of 9% for the first quarter of 2009, compared to the
      same period in 2008, primarily due to increased generic competition as
      well as an overall decline in u.s. hypertension market
    volume.

lyrica, indicated for
      the management of post-herpetic neuralgia (phn), diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (dpn), and fibromyalgia, and as adjunctive therapy for adult
      patients with partial onset seizures in the u.s., and for neuropathic pain
      and general anxiety disorder (gad) outside the u.s., recorded worldwide
      revenues of $684 million in the first quarter of 2009, an increase of 17%,
      compared to the same period in 2008. lyrica’s prescription volume in the
      u.s. has been adversely affected by increased generic competition
      reflecting the global recession. in june 2007, lyrica was approved in the
      u.s. for the management of fibromyalgia, one of the most common chronic
      widespread pain conditions, which affects more than five million
      americans. lyrica is the leading branded agent for neuropathic pain
      worldwide and for dpn/phn and fibromyalgia in the
  u.s.





in july
2008, an fda advisory committee concurred with the fda’s finding of a potential
increased signal regarding suicidal thoughts and behavior for the class of 11
epilepsy drugs reviewed, including lyrica and neurontin. in april 2009, we
updated the lyrica and neurontin labels to include this new warning. we are
confident in the efficacy and safety profile of lyrica and neurontin for their
approved indications.

geodon/zeldox, a
      psychotropic agent, is a dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist
      indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed
      episodes associated with bipolar disorder. it is available in both an oral
      capsule and rapid-acting intramuscular formulation. in the first quarter
      of 2009, geodon worldwide revenues decreased 5%, compared to the same
      period in 2008, due to increased generic competition, slow growth in the
      antipsychotic market in the u.s. as well as the unfavorable impact of
      foreign exchange. geodon is supported by pfizer’s recently launched
      psychiatric field force and geodon’s efficacy and favorable tolerability
      and metabolic profiles.

celebrex, a treatment
      for the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and
      acute pain in adults, experienced an 8% decrease in worldwide revenues to
      $564 million for the first quarter of 2009, due to increased generic
      competition. celebrex is supported by continued educational and
      promotional efforts highlighting its efficacy and safety profile for
      appropriate patients.

zyvox is the world’s
      best-selling branded agent for the treatment of certain serious
      gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant
      staphylococcus-aureus (mrsa).  mrsa remains a serious and
      growing threat in hospitals and the community. zyvox is an excellent
      first-line choice for the treatment of adults and children with
      complicated skin and skin structure infections and nosocomial pneumonia
      due to known or suspected mrsa. zyvox is the only fda-approved agent for
      mrsa that offers intravenous and oral formulations for these indications.
      its unique mechanism of action minimizes the potential for
      cross-resistance. to date, more than three million patients have been
      treated worldwide. zyvox worldwide sales grew 9% to $283 million in the
      first quarter of 2009.

selzentry/celsentri,
      (maraviroc tablets), a ccr5 antagonist, is the first in a new class of
      oral hiv medicines in more than a decade known as ccr5 antagonists.
      selzentry/celsentri was approved in the u.s. and europe in 2007 and in
      japan in 2008, and is indicated for combination anti-retroviral treatment
      of treatment-experienced adults infected with only ccr5-tropic hiv-1, who
      have evidence of viral replication and have hiv-1 strains resistant to
      multiple anti-retroviral agents. a diagnostic test confirms whether a
      patient is infected with ccr5-tropic hiv-1, which is also known as
      “r5-virus.” on april 16, 2009, we announced that we entered into an
      agreement with gsk to form a new, hiv company that will develop and market
      our combined portfolio of hiv assets, including selzentry/celsentri. (see

      worldwide revenues declined 1% to $454 million in the first quarter of
      2009 compared to the same period in 2008. in the u.s., revenues of $258
      million in the first quarter of 2009 increased 16% compared with the same
      period in 2008. internationally, viagra revenues of $196 million in the
      first quarter of 2009 decreased 18% compared to the same period in 2008
      due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, increased competition
      and the loss of market exclusivity in a number of countries in
      europe.

detrol/detrol la, a
      muscarinic receptor antagonist, is the most prescribed branded medicine
      worldwide for overactive bladder. detrol la is an extended-release

      8% to $289 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the same
      period in 2008 primarily due to increased competition from other branded
      medicines.

sutent, for the treatment
      of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stomach tumors (gist) after disease
      progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate, was launched in the
      u.s. in january 2006. it has now been launched in all major markets,
      including japan, where it was approved in april 2008 for the treatment of
      gist, after failure of imatinib treatment due to resistance, and for renal
      cell carcinoma not indicated for curative resection and mrcc. sutent
      recorded worldwide revenues of $202 million in the first quarter of 2009,
      an increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2008. we continue to
      drive growth in the u.s. and internationally, supported by
      cost-effectiveness data and efficacy data in first-line mrcc – including
      2-year survival data, which represents the first time overall survival of
      two years has been seen in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, as
      well as through the promotion of access and health care coverage. as of
      march 29, 2009, sutent was the best-selling medicine in the world for the
      treatment of first-line mrcc.

camptosar, indicated as
      first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with
      5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, lost exclusivity in the u.s. in february
      2008. it is also indicated for patients in whom metastatic colorectal
      cancer has recurred or progressed following initial fluorouracil-based
      therapy. camptosar is for intravenous use only. camptosar worldwide
      revenues in the first quarter of 2009 decreased 43% to $109 million,
      compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of the loss of
      exclusivity.

xalatan, a
      prostaglandin, is the world’s leading branded agent to reduce elevated eye
      pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
      xalatan's proven clinical benefits and studies demonstrating long-term
      safety should support the continued growth of this important medicine.
      xalacom, a fixed
      combination prostaglandin (xalatan) and beta blocker (timolol), is
      available outside the u.s. xalatan/xalacom worldwide revenues were flat in
      the first quarter of 2009, compared to the same period in

      turner syndrome, small for gestational age syndrome, idiopathic short
      stature (in the u.s. only) and chronic renal insufficiency (outside the
      u.s. only), as well as in adults with growth hormone deficiency.
      genotropin is supported by a broad platform of innovative
      injection-delivery devices. genotropin worldwide revenues decreased 4% in
      the first quarter of 2009 to $197 million, compared to the same period in
      2008 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign
      exchange.

vfend, as the only
      branded agent available in intravenous and oral forms, continues to build
      on its position as the best selling systemic, antifungal agent worldwide.
      vfend’s overall global sales continue to be driven by its acceptance as an
      excellent broad spectrum agent for treating yeast and moulds. in the u.s.,
      vfend’s growth continues to outpace the overall market driven by the oral
      form which has gained solid positioning as a step-down agent that
      facilitates discharge from the hospital.  vfend recorded
      worldwide revenues of $179 million in the first quarter of 2009, an
      increase of 5% compared to the same period in 2008. in the u.s., revenues
      of $62 million in the first quarter of 2009 increased 18% compared to the
      same period in 2008, reflecting solid growth.  internationally,
      vfend revenues were $117 million in the first quarter of 2009, a 1%
      decrease compared to the same period in 2008, due to the unfavorable
      impact of foreign exchange.

our animal
health business is one of the largest in the world.

the
decrease in animal health revenues in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the
same period in 2008, was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange, which
decreased revenues by 8%.

our
revenue performance was also negatively impacted by the following:





·


the
      global recession, which negatively affected global spending on veterinary
      care; and









·


a
      planned change in terms with u.s. distributors resulting in an
      anticipated, one-time reduction in u.s. distributor
      inventories.





product
developments

we
continue to invest in r&d to provide future sources of revenues through the
development of new products, as well as through additional uses for existing
in-line and alliance products, and we have taken important steps to prioritize
our research and development portfolio to maximize value. after a review of all
our therapeutic areas, in 2008, we announced our decision to exit certain
disease areas - anemia, atherosclerosis/hyperlipidemia, bone health/frailty,
gastrointestinal, heart failure, liver fibrosis, muscle, obesity, osteoarthritis
(disease-modifying concepts only) and peripheral arterial disease - and give
higher priority to the following disease areas: alzheimer’s disease, diabetes,
inflammation/immunology, oncology, pain and psychoses (schizophrenia). we also
will continue to work in many other disease areas, such as asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disorder, genitourinary, infectious diseases,
ophthalmology, smoking cessation, thrombosis and transplant, among others. these
decisions did not affect our portfolio of marketed products, the development of
compounds then in phase 3 or any launches planned over the next three years.
notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to when, or if, we will
receive regulatory approval for additional indications for existing products or
any of our other products in development.

in april
2009, we and gsk announced that we entered into an agreement to create a new
company focused solely on research, development and commercialization of hiv
medicines. we will contribute selzentry/celsentri (maraviroc), among other
assets, to that company. (see further discussion in the “our strategic
initiatives - strategy and recent transactions: acquisitions, licensing and
collaborations” section of this md&a.)

we
received “not-approvable” letters from the fda for fablyn (lasofoxifene) for the
prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis in september 2005 and for the
treatment of vaginal atrophy in january 2006. we submitted a new nda for the
treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women in december 2007, including
the three-year interim data from the postmenopausal evaluation and
risk-reduction with lasofoxifene (pearl) study in support of the new nda. in
september 2008, nine of the 13 members of an fda advisory committee concluded
that there is a population of women with post-menopausal osteoporosis for which
the benefit of treatment with fablyn is likely to outweigh the risks. we
received a “complete response” letter from the fda in january 2009.
subsequently, following a strategic review, we decided to explore strategic
options for fablyn, including outlicensing or sale.

in
september 2008, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the
spiriva respimat submission. the fda is seeking additional data and we are
working with the fda to provide the additional information. a full response will
be submitted to the fda upon the completion of ongoing studies.

in
september 2007, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for zmax that
sets forth requirements to obtain approval for the pediatric aom indication
based on pharmacokinetic data. a supplemental filing for pediatric aom and
sinusitis remains under review.

in
december 2005, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for our vfend
pediatric filing, which sets forth the additional requirements for approval. we
have been systematically working through these requirements and addressing the
fda’s concerns, including initiating an additional pharmacokinetics study in
november 2008.

in june
2008, we completed the acquisition of encysive pharmaceuticals inc. (encysive),
whose main product is thelin. in june 2007, encysive received a third
“approvable” letter from the fda for thelin for the treatment of pah. we began
an additional phase 3 clinical trial in patients with pah during the fourth
quarter of 2008 to address the concerns of the fda regarding efficacy as
reflected in that letter.

on april
23, 2009, the european medicines agency’s committee for medicinal products for
human use (chmp) issued a negative opinion, recommending that the european
commission not add an indication for the treatment of fibromyalgia to the
marketing authorization for lyrica. the chmp was of the opinion that the
benefits of lyrica in the treatment of fibromyalgia did not outweigh its risks.
lyrica remains approved in europe for the indications of neuropathic pain,

in april
2009, we terminated one of four ongoing phase 3 trials of sutent for the
treatment of advanced breast cancer for futility. the trial evaluated
single-agent sutent versus single-agent capecitabine for the treatment of a
broad range of patients with advanced breast cancer after failure of standard
treatment. we are continuing to evaluate sutent as a single agent and in
combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy in specific patient populations
with advanced breast cancer through three additional phase 3 and two phase 2
trials.

new drug
candidates in late-stage development include: cp-690550, a jak-3 kinase
inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; axitinib, a multi-targeted
kinase inhibitor for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma; dimebon, a novel
mitochondrial protectant and enhancer being developed in partnership with
medivation, inc. for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease; cp-751871, an
anti-insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (igf1r) human monoclonal antibody for
the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer; dalbavancin for treatment of skin
and skin structure infections; tanezumab, an anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal
antibody for the treatment of pain; and apixaban, for acute coronary syndrome,
the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and prevention of stroke
in patients with atrial fibrillation, which is being developed in collaboration
with bristol-myers squibb company (bms).

in
september 2008, we announced that we would globally withdraw all dalbavancin
marketing applications for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure
gram-positive bacterial infections in adults, including the u.s. nda and the
european marketing authorization application. a pediatric pharmacokinetic
pediatric study with dalbavancin was initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and
remains in progress.

in
february 2009, we terminated the development programs for pd-332334, an
alpha2delta ligand compound for the treatment of gad, and esreboxetine, for the
treatment of fibromyalgia, because it was considered unlikely that either
compound would provide meaningful benefit to patients beyond the current
standard of care.

in january
2009, we terminated the development program for axitinib, a multi-targeted
kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, after the review of
interim data showed that the trial would not demonstrate superiority to the
current standard of care.

additional
product-related programs are in various stages of discovery and development.

transactions: acquisitions, licensing and collaborations” section of this

cost of
sales decreased 29% in the first quarter of 2009, while revenues decreased 8% in
the first quarter of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. cost of sales as
a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2009 decreased 3.8 percentage
points compared to the same period in 2008, reflecting:





·


savings
      related to our cost-reduction
initiatives;









·


the
      favorable impact of foreign exchange on expenses;
  and









·


the
      impact of lower implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction
      initiatives of $76 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $138
      million in the first quarter of
2008.





selling, informational and
administrative expenses

selling,
informational and administrative (si&a) expenses decreased 18% in the first
quarter of 2009, compared to the first quarter of 2008, which
reflects:





·


savings
      related to our cost-reduction
initiatives;









·


the
      favorable impact of foreign exchange on
  expenses;









·


the
      impact of lower implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction

      costs.





research and development
expenses

research
and development (r&d) expenses decreased 5% in the first quarter of 2009,
compared to the same period in 2008, which reflects:





·


savings
      related to our cost-reduction
initiatives;









·


the
      favorable impact of foreign exchange on expenses;
  and









·


the
      impact of lower implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction
      initiatives of $41 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $146
      million in the first quarter of
2008;





partially
offset by:





·


a
      $150 million milestone payment to bms recorded in the first quarter of
      2009 in connection with the collaboration on
  apixaban.





acquisition-related
in-process research and development charges

as
required through december 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (ipr&d) was expensed at acquisition
date. ipr&d of $398 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008,
primarily related to our acquisitions of covx and coley and two smaller
acquisitions related to animal health. as a result of adopting financial
accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no. 141r,
business combinations,
as amended, beginning january 1, 2009, ipr&d related to future acquisitions
will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived
intangible assets. we made no acquisitions in the first quarter of
2009.

cost-reduction
initiatives

during
2008, we completed the cost-reduction and transformation initiatives which were
launched in early 2005, broadened in october 2006 and expanded in january 2007.
these initiatives were designed to increase efficiency and streamline
decision-making across the company and change the way we run our businesses to
meet the challenges of a changing business environment, as well as take
advantage of the diverse opportunities in the marketplace.

we have
generated net cost reductions through site rationalization in r&d and
manufacturing, streamlining organizational structures, sales force and staff
function reductions, and increased outsourcing and procurement savings. these
and other actions have allowed us to reduce costs in support services and
facilities.






38









on january
26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new cost-reduction initiative
that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs of
approximately $3 billion, based on the actual foreign exchange rates in effect
during 2008, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total costs. we
expect that this program will be completed by the end of 2010, with full savings
to be realized by the end of 2011. we plan to reinvest approximately $1 billion
of these savings in the business, resulting in an expected $2 billion net
decrease compared to our 2008 adjusted total costs. (for an understanding of
adjusted income, see the “adjusted income” section of this
md&a.)

the
actions associated with our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in restructuring
charges, such as asset impairments, exit costs and severance costs (including
any related impacts to our benefit plans, including settlements and
curtailments) and associated implementation costs, such as depreciation arising
from the shortening of the useful lives of certain assets, primarily associated
with supply network transformation efforts and expenses associated with system
and process standardization and the expansion of shared services worldwide. (see
notes to condensed consolidated financial statements - note 5. cost-reduction
initiatives.) the strengthening
of the dollar relative to the euro, uk pound, canadian dollar and other
currencies, while unfavorable on revenues, has had a positive
impact on our total expenses (cost of sales, selling,
informational and administrative expenses, and research and development
expenses), including the reported
impact of these cost-reduction efforts.

initiatives:

(a)


transaction
      costs include banking, legal, accounting and other costs directly related
      to our pending acquisition of wyeth. substantially all of the costs
      incurred to date are fees related to our $22.5 billion bridge credit
      agreement entered into with financial institutions on march 12, 2009 (see
      notes to condensed consolidated financial statements - note 8c. financial
      instruments: long-term debt) to partially fund our pending
      acquisition of wyeth. upon our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior
      unsecured notes on march 24, 2009, the commitment under the bridge credit
      agreement was reduced by an amount equal to the net proceeds we received
      from such issuance, to a current balance of $9.1 billion, and,
      accordingly, we expensed the portion of the bridge credit agreement fees
      associated with the $13.5 billion
reduction.








(b)


pre-integration
      costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to our
      pending acquisition of wyeth and include costs associated with preparing
      for systems and other integration
activities.

      in restructuring charges
      and acquisition-related

39









other (income)/deductions -
net

in the
first quarter of 2009, we recorded lower net interest income of $116 million,
compared to $203 million in the first quarter of 2008, due primarily to lower
interest rates, partially offset by higher cash balances in first-quarter 2009.
the lower net interest income included $23 million of net interest expense in
the first quarter of 2009 associated with the $13.5 billion of senior unsecured
notes that we issued in march 2009 related to the pending acquisition of wyeth.
in addition, we recorded litigation charges of $95 million in the first quarter
of 2009 compared to no such charges in the first quarter of 2008.

provision for taxes on
income

our
effective tax rate for continuing operations was 28.2% for the first quarter of
2009, compared to 21.5% for the first quarter of 2008. the higher tax rate for
the first quarter of 2009 is primarily due to the increased tax costs associated
with certain business decisions executed to finance the pending acquisition of
wyeth, partially offset by the change in geographic mix of expenses incurred to
execute our cost-reduction initiatives, as well as the elimination of ipr&d
charges, which generally are not deductible for tax purposes.

adjusted
income

general description of
adjusted income measure

adjusted
income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe
that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this
performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results
of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and
sale of prescription medicines for humans and animals–prior to considering
certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income
attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for
acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain
significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed
as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income.

the
adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we
measure the performance of the overall company on this basis, in conjunction
with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted
income measure is utilized.





·


senior
      management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is
      prepared on an adjusted income
basis;









·


our
      annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis;
    and









·


senior
      management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted
      income measure. adjusted income is one of the performance metrics utilized
      in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual
      incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the
      executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code
      section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are
      funded from a pool based on the achievement of three financial metrics,
      including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from
      adjusted income. these metrics derived from adjusted income account for
      (i) 17% of the target bonus for elt members and (ii) 33% of the bonus pool
      made available to elt members and other members of senior
      management.





despite
the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance
measurement, we stress that adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that
has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits
in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition,
adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the
calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented
solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our
performance.

we also
recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income
measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performance-management
process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is
that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a
period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased
intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other
companies in the pharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically
tailored tools designed to ensure the highest levels of our performance. for
example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its
effectiveness is measured. in addition, performance share awards grants made in
2006, 2007, 2008 and future years will be paid based on a non-discretionary
formula that measures our performance using relative total shareholder
return.






40









purchase accounting
adjustments

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering certain significant
purchase-accounting impacts, such as those related to business combinations and
net asset acquisitions (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
– note 3. acquisitions). these impacts can include charges
for purchased in-process r&d (prior to january 1, 2009), the incremental
charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up
to fair value and the incremental charges related to the amortization of
finite-lived intangible assets for the increase to fair value. therefore, the
adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the
acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant
charges.

certain of
the purchase-accounting adjustments associated with a business combination, such
as the amortization of intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition
of pharmacia in 2003, can occur for up to 40 years (these assets have a
weighted-average useful life of approximately nine years), but this presentation
provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to
internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of
amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and
investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a
degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research
and development costs have been previously expensed.

however, a
completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and
acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this
component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items
listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the
impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we
had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this
approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have
occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs
in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to
commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our
costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts
may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there
can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as
presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible
assets.

acquisition-related
costs

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering integration and restructuring costs
associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each
transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate
two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity,
only transaction costs and restructuring and integration activities that are
associated with a purchase business combination or a net-asset acquisition are
included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the
resulting synergies.

we believe
that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a
useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a
business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate
assets, activities or employees – a natural result of acquiring a fully
integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs
incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to
eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business
combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more
normal business contexts.

the
integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may
occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three
years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for
some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and
integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated
nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take
several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation
and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory
authorities.

discontinued
operations

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in
discontinued operations as well as any related gains or losses on the sale of
such operations. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors
because, while we review our businesses and product lines periodically for
strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with an
intent to sell them.






41









certain significant
items

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain
significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an
individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the
qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may
represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as
a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our
normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items
that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of
items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major
non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs
for a program which is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those
related to our cost-reduction initiatives; charges related to certain sales or
disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued
operations as defined by u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transition service
agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible
asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax
positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax
legislation, such as adjustments associated with charges attributable to the
repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the american jobs creation
act of 2004; net interest expense associated with acquisition-related borrowings
in advance of the consummation date of the pending acquisition of wyeth; or
possible charges related to legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in
legal proceedings in
our form 10-k and in part ii: other information; item 1.
legal proceedings,
included in our form 10-q filings. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company
or settlements and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our
business would not be considered certain significant items.

we rely
largely on operating cash flow, short-term investments, short-term commercial
paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for the working capital needs of
our operations, including our r&d activities. we believe that we have the
ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs
for the foreseeable future.  the significant changes in the components
of net financial assets are described below.

on january
26, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement under
which we will acquire wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction valued on that date
at $50.19 per share, or a total of $68 billion. we plan to finance this
acquisition with a combination of cash, debt financing and common stock. on
march 12, 2009, we entered into the bridge credit agreement with certain lenders
under which the lenders agreed to provide loans of up to an aggregate principal
amount of $22.5 billion. the proceeds of such loans are required to be used to
fund a portion of the merger consideration and certain fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the merger. the financing commitment is subject to
certain covenants, which include, but are not limited to, a requirement that
there be no material adverse change with respect to pfizer or wyeth and pfizer
maintaining credit ratings of at least a2/a long-term stable/stable and a1/p1
short-term. (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements - note 8g. financial
instruments: credit
covenants.)

on march
24, 2009, pfizer issued $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in anticipation
of the acquisition of wyeth. the note proceeds were generally invested in
short-term available-for-sale investments such as money market funds, u.s.
treasury notes and, to a lesser extent, corporate debt. upon our issuance of the
notes, the bridge credit agreement commitment was reduced by an amount equal to
the net proceeds received from such issuance, to a current balance of $9.1
billion.

investments

our
short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality,
investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. wherever possible, cash
management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working
capital to our operations. where local restrictions prevent intercompany
financing, working capital needs are met through operating cash flows and/or
external borrowings. our portfolio of financial assets increased in the first
quarter of 2009 as a result of the proceeds of the notes issued in anticipation
of the acquisition of wyeth.

credit
ratings

two major
corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s investors service (moody’s) &
standard and poor’s (s&p), assign ratings to our short-term and long-term
debt. the following chart reflects the current ratings assigned by these rating
agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit enhanced
long-term debt issued by us:

on january
26, 2009, after our announcement that we had entered into a definitive merger
agreement under which we will acquire wyeth, moody’s put us on review for
possible downgrade and s&p put us on credit watch with negative outlook
implications. on march 11, 2009, moody’s downgraded our long-term-debt credit
rating to aa2, its third-highest investment grade rating. the downgrade reflects
moody’s assessment that pfizer’s stand-alone credit quality had deteriorated
based on the approaching lipitor patent expiration. we do not expect the wyeth
acquisition to impact our credit ratings for commercial paper, but we do expect
a possible reduction in our long-term debt ratings, from aa2/negative to
a1/stable long term (moody’s) and from aaa/negative to aa/stable long term
(s&p).

debt
capacity

we have
available lines of credit and revolving-credit agreements with a group of banks
and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent
balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other
short-term borrowings. as of march 29, 2009, we had access to $8.2 billion of
lines of credit, of which $6.0 billion expire within one year. of these lines of
credit, $8.1 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us
$7.1 billion at our request. $7.0 billion of the unused lines of credit, of
which $5.0 billion expire in 2010 and $2.0 billion expire in 2013, may be used
to support our commercial paper borrowings.

in march
2007, we filed a securities registration statement with the securities and
exchange commission. this registration statement was filed under the automatic
“shelf registration” process available to “well-known seasoned issuers” and is
effective for three years. we can issue securities of various types under that
registration statement at any time, subject to approval by our board of
directors in certain circumstances. on march 24, 2009, in connection with
financing our pending acquisition of wyeth, we issued $13.5 billion of senior
unsecured notes under this registration statement. (see notes to condensed
consolidated financial statements - note 8c. financial instruments:
long-term debt.)

on march
12, 2009, we entered into the bridge credit agreement with certain lenders under
which the lenders agreed to provide up to $22.5 billion in connection with our
pending acquisition of wyeth. upon our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior
unsecured notes on march 24, 2009, the bridge credit agreement commitment was
reduced by an amount equal to the net proceeds received from such issuance, to a
current balance of $9.1 billion. (see notes to condensed consolidated financial
statements - note 8b.
financial instruments: short-term borrowings.) the bridge credit
agreement subjects us to certain covenants, including a prohibition on incurring
certain types of debt, until the commitment expires or is terminated and all
loans under the agreement, if any, have been paid. (see notes to condensed
consolidated financial statements - note 8g. financial instruments:
credit covenants.)

financial risk
management

due to the
pending acquisition of wyeth and in light of current market conditions, we
currently borrow primarily on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. we may change this
practice as market conditions change.

changes in global financial
markets

towards
the end of the third quarter of 2008, dramatic changes in the global financial
markets weakened global economic conditions. these changes have not had, nor do
we anticipate they will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our
significant operating cash flow, financial assets, access to the capital markets
and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to
believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable
future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity
position.

goodwill and other
intangible assets

as of
march 29, 2009, goodwill
totaled $21.5 billion (17% of our total assets) and identifiable intangible assets, less
accumulated amortization, totaled $16.9 billion (14% of our total
assets). as of march 29, 2009, finite-lived intangible assets, net, include
$13.0 billion related to developed technology rights and $520 million related to
brands. indefinite-lived intangible assets include $2.9 billion related to
brands.

at least
annually, we review all of our intangible assets, including goodwill, for
impairment. for goodwill, volatility in securities markets and changes in
pfizer’s market capitalization can impact these calculations. we had no
significant impairments in the first quarter of 2009 or 2008. none of our
goodwill is impaired as of march 29, 2009.

2008.








(b)


represents
      total shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of common shares
      outstanding (which excludes treasury shares and shares held by our
      employee benefit trust).





the
increases in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and loans,
working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, as of
march 29, 2009, compared to december 31, 2008, were primarily due to the
investment of the proceeds from our issuance of $13.5 billion of long-term debt
in anticipation of our acquisition of wyeth and the timing of accruals, cash
receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.

net cash provided by
operating activities

during the
first quarter of 2009, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1
billion, compared to $3.3 billion in the same period of 2008. the slightly lower
net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable
to:





·


the
      timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of
      business.





net cash used in investing
activities

during the
first quarter of 2009, net cash used in investing activities was $13.6 billion,
compared to $5.5 billion in the same period in 2008. the increase in net cash
used in investing activities was primarily attributable to:





·


net
      purchases of investments of $13.6 billion in the first quarter of 2009
      primarily reflecting the investment of proceeds from our issuance of $13.5
      billion of senior unsecured notes compared to $4.3 billion in the same
      period in 2008.





net cash provided by
financing activities

during the
first quarter of 2009, net cash provided by financing activities was $9.6
billion, compared to $848 million in the same period in 2008. the increase in
net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable
to:





·


net
      borrowings of $11.8 billion in the first quarter of 2009 primarily
      reflecting the proceeds from our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior
      unsecured notes compared to $3.0 billion in the same period in
      2008.





in june
2005, we announced a $5 billion share-purchase program. in june 2006, the board
of directors increased the share purchase authorization from $5 billion to $18
billion. in january 2008, we announced a new $5 billion share-purchase program,
to be funded by operating cash flows, that may be utilized from time to time. on
january 26, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger
agreement under which we will acquire wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction. the
merger agreement limits our stock purchases to a maximum of $500 million prior
to the completion of the transaction without wyeth’s consent. the bridge credit
agreement limits our stock purchases and redemptions to a maximum of $250
million until the commitment expires or is terminated, and all loans under the
agreement, if any, have been paid.






46









off-balance sheet
arrangements

in the
ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and
businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities
that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to
activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to
environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent
infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim
pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse
the loss. these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts,
specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we
have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of march 29,
2009, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications
are not significant.

certain of
our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights
to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions,
co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of
our products.

dividends on common
stock

in
december 2008, our board of directors declared a first-quarter 2009 dividend of
$0.32 per share. in january 2009, in connection with the pending merger between
pfizer and wyeth, the board of directors determined that, effective with the
dividend to be paid in the second quarter of 2009 and in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement, it would reduce our quarterly dividend per share
of common stock to $0.16. in april 2009, the board of directors declared a
second-quarter dividend of $0.16 per share. the merger agreement prohibits us
from declaring a quarterly dividend on our common stock in excess of $0.16 per
share without wyeth’s consent prior to the completion of the transaction. the
bridge credit agreement prohibits us from declaring and paying a quarterly
dividend on our common stock in excess of $0.32 per share until the commitment
expires or is terminated and all loans under the agreement, if any, have been
paid.

new accounting
standards

recently adopted accounting
standards

as of
january 1, 2009, we adopted financial accounting standards board (fasb)
statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 141r, business combinations, as
amended. sfas 141r, as amended, retains the purchase method of accounting for
acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way
assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting. it also changes
the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from
contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and
development costs at fair value and requires the expensing of
acquisition-related costs as incurred. the adoption of sfas 141r, as amended,
did not impact our consolidated financial statements upon adoption, but does
impact the accounting for future acquisitions, including our pending acquisition
of wyeth.

as of
january 1, 2009, we adopted fasb financial staff position (fsp) sfas no. 142-3,
determination of the useful
life of intangible assets. fsp sfas 142-3 amends the factors considered
in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life
of a recognized intangible asset. among other things, in the absence of
historical experience, an entity will be required to consider assumptions used
by market participants. the adoption of fsp sfas 142-3 did not impact our
consolidated financial statements upon adoption, but could impact the accounting
for future acquisitions.

as of
january 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of fasb sfas no. 157, fair value measurements, as
amended, that we did not adopt as of january 1, 2008. sfas 157, as amended,
defines fair value, expands related disclosure requirements and specifies a
hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to
develop the fair value measures. the adoption of the remaining provisions of
sfas 157, as amended, did not have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements upon adoption, but will impact the accounting for future
acquisitions, including our pending acquisition of wyeth, and other events and
transactions measured at fair value.

as of
january 1, 2009, we adopted fasb sfas no. 160, noncontrolling interests in
consolidated financial statements, an amendment of accounting research
bulletin no. 51, consolidated
financial statements. sfas 160 provides guidance for the accounting,
reporting and disclosure of noncontrolling interests, previously referred to as
minority interests. a noncontrolling interest represents the portion of equity
(net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a
parent. the adoption of sfas 160 resulted in a number of changes to the
presentation of our consolidated financial statements, but the amounts
associated with noncontrolling interests are not significant. sfas 160 could
impact our accounting for future acquisitions where we do not acquire 100% of
the entity and our accounting for the deconsolidations of
subsidiaries.






47









as of
january 1, 2009, we adopted emerging issues task force (eitf) issue no. 07-1,
accounting for collaborative
arrangements. eitf 07-1 provides guidance on: determining whether an
arrangement constitutes a collaborative arrangement within the scope of the
issue; how costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties should
be reported in the income statement; how an entity should characterize payments
on the income statement; and what participants should disclose in the notes to
the financial statements about a collaborative arrangement. the adoption of eitf
07-1 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements,
and additional disclosures have been provided. (see notes to condensed
consolidated financial statements – note 4. collaborative
arrangements.)

as of
january 1, 2009, we adopted eitf issue no. 08-3, accounting by lessees for
maintenance deposits. eitf 08-3 provides guidance that maintenance
deposits paid by a lessee and subsequently refunded only if a lessee fulfills a
maintenance obligation will be accounted for as a deposit asset. the adoption of
eitf 08-3 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

as of
january 1, 2009, we adopted eitf issue no. 08-6, equity method investment accounting
considerations. eitf 08-6 clarifies how to account for certain
transactions involving equity method investments in areas such as how to
determine the initial carrying value of the investment; how to allocate the
difference between the investor’s carrying value and the investor’s share of the
underlying equity of the investment; how to perform an impairment assessment of
underlying intangibles held by the investee; how to account for the investee’s
issuance of additional shares; and how to account for an investment on the cost
method when it had been previously accounted for under the equity method. the
adoption of eitf 08-6 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements, but could impact the accounting for future equity method
investments.

as of
january 1, 2009, we adopted eitf issue no. 08-7, accounting for defensive intangible
assets. eitf 08-7 clarifies the accounting for certain separately
identifiable assets, which an acquirer does not intend to actively use but
intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them. eitf
08-7 requires an acquirer to account for a defensive intangible asset as a
separate unit of accounting, which should be amortized to expense over the
period the asset diminishes in value. the adoption of eitf 08-7 did not have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, but could impact
the accounting for future acquisitions.

recently issued accounting
standards, not adopted as of march 29, 2009

in april
2009, the fasb issued fsp no. 115-2, recognition and presentation of
other than temporary impairments. fsp 115-2 amends how one determines
that an impairment of an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt security is
other than temporary. also, the standard amends how one determines the amount of
the impairment that would be recorded as a reduction in net income or an
increase in other comprehensive expense. the provisions of fsp 115-2 will be
adopted when required in the second quarter of 2009. we do not expect the
adoption of the provisions of fsp 115-2 to have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

in april
2009, the fasb issued fsp no. 157-4 determining fair value when the
volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly
decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly. fsp 157-4
provides additional guidance for estimating fair value. the provisions of fsp
157-4 will be adopted prospectively when required in the second quarter of 2009.
we do not expect the adoption of the provisions of fsp 157-4 to have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, but may impact the
accounting for future acquisitions, including our pending acquisition of wyeth,
and other events and transactions measured at fair value.

outlook

while our
revenues and income will continue to be tempered in the near term due to patent
expirations and other factors, we will continue to make the investments
necessary to sustain long-term growth. we remain confident that pfizer has the
organizational strength and resilience, as well as the strategies, financial
depth and flexibility, to succeed in the long term. however, no assurance can be
given that the factors described above under “our operating environment” or
below under “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future
results” or other significant factors will not have a material adverse effect on
our business and financial results.

our 2009
guidance reflects the projected impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar,
increased pension expenses and lower interest income. it also reflects an
increase in the effective tax rate associated with certain business decisions
executed to finance the pending wyeth acquisition.






48









at current
exchange rates, we forecast 2009 revenues of $44.0 billion to $46.0 billion, and
adjusted diluted earnings per common share (eps) of $1.85 to $1.95. we reduced
our guidance for 2009 reported diluted eps attributable to pfizer inc. common
shareholders to a range of $1.20 to $1.35 from $1.34 to $1.49 to reflect certain
costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with the pending
acquisition of wyeth.

on january
26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new cost-reduction initiative
that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs of
approximately $3 billion, based on the actual foreign exchange rates in effect
during 2008, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total costs. we
expect that this program will be completed by the end of 2010, with full savings
to be realized by the end of 2011. we plan to reinvest approximately $1 billion
of these savings in the business, resulting in an expected $2 billion net
decrease compared to our 2008 adjusted total costs. (for an understanding of
adjusted income, see the “adjusted income” section of this
md&a.)

as
referenced in this section, “current exchange rates” is defined as rates
approximating foreign currency spot rates in april 2009.

given
these and other factors, a reconciliation, at current exchange rates and
reflecting management’s current assessment, of 2009 adjusted income and adjusted

      this md&a.





our 2009
forecasted financial performance guidance is subject to a number of factors and
uncertainties, as described in the “forward-looking information and factors that
may affect future results” section of this md&a.

forward looking information
and factors that may affect future results

the
securities and exchange commission (sec) encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. this report and other
written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain such
forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on
management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to
identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,”
“forecast,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any
discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans and
prospects. in
particular,
these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and
prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or
results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal
proceedings, and financial results. among the factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially are the following:





·

  products;









·


impact
      of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product
      exclusivity;









·


trends
      toward managed care and healthcare cost
  containment;

      legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things,
      pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including under
      medicaid, medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health
      programs; the importation of prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at
      prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries;
      direct-to-consumer advertising and interactions with healthcare
      professionals; and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that
      could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost
      differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical
      products and restricts access to innovative
  medicines;









·


impact
      of the medicare prescription drug, improvement, and modernization act of
      2003;









·


legislation
      or regulatory action in markets outside the u.s. affecting pharmaceutical
      product pricing, reimbursement or
access;

      breakdown, infiltration or interruption of our information technology
      systems and infrastructure;









·


legal
      defense costs, insurance expenses, settlement costs and the risk of an
      adverse decision or settlement related to product liability, patent
      protection, governmental investigations, ongoing efforts to explore
      various means for resolving asbestos litigation, and other legal
      proceedings;

      the impact on us, our lenders, our customers, our suppliers and
      counterparties to our foreign-exchange and interest-rate agreements of the
      global recession and recent and possible future changes in global
      financial markets;

we cannot
guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we
believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of
anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and
inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results
could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or
projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking
statements.

we
undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised,
however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our
form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports to the securities and exchange
commission.
 
our form
10-k filing for the 2008 fiscal year listed various important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from projected and historic results.
we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that
filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that
form 10-k in this filing and investors should refer to it. you should understand
that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently,
you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential
risks or uncertainties.

this
report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various
in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of
a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates,
and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body
of data.

legal proceedings and
contingencies

we and
certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product liability,
consumer, commercial, securities, environmental and tax litigations and claims;
government investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to
time in the ordinary course of our business. we do not believe any of them will
have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

we record
accruals for income tax contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a tax
position is not sustainable under a “more likely than not” standard, and we
record our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that
could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction when
we conclude that the potential recovery is more likely than not. we record
accruals for all other contingencies to the extent that we conclude their
occurrence is probable and the related damages are estimable, and we record
anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when assured of
recovery. if a range of liability is probable and estimable and some amount
within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within
the range, we accrue that amount. if a range of liability is probable and
estimable and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than
any other amount within the range, we accrue the minimum of such probable range.
many claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, label warnings,
scientific evidence, actual damages and other matters. often these issues are
subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of loss and
an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. consequently, we cannot
reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss
in excess of amounts accrued for these contingencies. these assessments can
involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily
on estimates and assumptions. our assessments are based on estimates and
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. litigation is
inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. although we believe
we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incur
judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations in any particular period.

patent
claims include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on
various products or processes. although we believe we have substantial defenses
to these challenges with respect to all our material patents, there can be no
assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases
could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue, which could
lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect
future results of operations.
