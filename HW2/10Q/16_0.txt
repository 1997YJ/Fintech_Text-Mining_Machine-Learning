the discussions that follow.      net income attributable to chevron corporation for third quarter 2018 was $4.05 billion ($2.11 per share — diluted), compared with earnings of $1.95 billion ($1.03 per share — diluted) in the corresponding 2017 period. net income attributable to chevron corporation for the first nine months of 2018 was $11.09 billion ($5.79 per share — diluted), compared with $6.08 billion ($3.21 per share — diluted) in the first nine months of 2017.upstream earnings in third quarter 2018 were $3.38 billion compared with $489 million a year earlier. earnings for the first nine months of 2018 were $10.03 billion compared with $2.86 billion a year earlier. in both periods, the increase was due to higher crude oil realizations and higher sales volumes.downstream earnings in third quarter 2018 were $1.37 billion compared with $1.81 billion in the corresponding 2017 period. the decrease was primarily due to lower gains on asset sales. earnings for the first nine months of 2018 were $2.94 billion compared with $3.94 billion in the corresponding 2017 period. the decrease was due to lower margins on refined product sales and lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by higher equity earnings from the 50 percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc and lower tax expenses.refer to pages 30 through 32 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for third quarter and first nine months of 2018 versus the same periods in 2017.business environment and outlookchevron corporation* is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, canada, china, colombia, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, nigeria, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, philippines, republic of congo, singapore, south korea, thailand, the united kingdom, the united states, and venezuela.earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. the most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. in the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. it is the company's objective to deliver competitive results and _____________________* incorporated in delaware in 1926 as standard oil company of california, the company adopted the name chevron corporation in 1984 and chevrontexaco corporation in 2001. in 2005, chevrontexaco corporation changed its name to chevron corporation. as used in this report, the term “chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and "its" may refer to chevron corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of chevron — i.e., those companies generally owned 50 percent or less. all of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 26table of contentsstockholder value in any business environment. periods of sustained lower prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. this is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. as a result, a decline or increase in the effective tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. note 12 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the third quarters of 2018 and 2017.refer to the "cautionary statement relevant to forward-looking information" on page 2 of this report and to "risk factors" on pages 19 through 22 of the company’s 2017 annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. the company's asset sale program for 2018 through 2020 is targeting before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses. the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.management's commentary related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas is as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) or other producers, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax and other applicable laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. cost pressures continue in the north america unconventional market, particularly the permian basin, with increases in commodity prices and higher levels of activity and investment.  international and offshore markets have begun to see indications of increased cost pressure. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses could also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.27table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $54 per barrel for the full-year 2017. during the third quarter 2018, brent averaged $75 per barrel and ended october at about $75. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. brent markets traded in a $70 to $80 per barrel range throughout most of the third quarter 2018 due to strong demand, sanctions imposed on iran by the u.s. government, and heightened geopolitical uncertainty impacting key oil producing economies.the wti price averaged $51 per barrel for the full-year 2017. during the third quarter 2018, wti averaged $70 per barrel and ended october at about $65. wti is currently trading at a discount to brent due to infrastructure constraints in getting inland crude to the coast.  the wti differential saw some reprieve from july through mid-august due to an unplanned decline in canadian production, but discounts returned to earlier levels by september when that production was fully restored.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high-gravity, low-sulfur crudes and low-gravity, high-sulfur crudes. the amount of the differential is associated with the relative supply/demand balances for each crude type, which in turn is influenced by refined product demand. in third quarter 2018, differentials generally narrowed outside of north america due to lower exports from key heavy crude producers, low fuel oil inventories and ample low-sulfur (sweet) crude supply. in north america, differentials grew modestly as a result of infrastructure constraints in many production locations, which restricted supplies to the market.chevron has interests in the production of heavy crude oil in california, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 36 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil sales prices.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in regional markets. fluctuations in the price of natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and stored in north america. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $2.91 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the first nine months of 2018, compared with $3.00 during the first nine months of 2017. at the end of october 2018, the henry hub spot price was $3.26 per mcf. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations. in some locations, chevron has invested in long-term projects to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. the company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (lng) are typically linked to crude oil prices. most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market.  the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. international natural gas sales prices averaged $6.10 per mcf during the first nine months of 2018, compared with $4.50 per mcf in the same period last year. (see page 36 for the company’s average natural gas sales prices for the u.s. and international regions.)28table of contentsthe company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2018 averaged 2.878 million barrels per day. about one-sixth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2018 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, republic of congo and venezuela. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for the third quarter of 2018 or 2017. the company expects net oil-equivalent production for the full-year 2018 to be at the top of the original guidance range of a 4 to 7 percent increase compared to 2017, excluding asset sales. this estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut-in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. the company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects. in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. net oil-equivalent production in the partitioned zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. as of early november 2018, production remained shut-in, and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between saudi arabia and kuwait. the financial effects from the loss of partitioned zone production have not been significant.in venezuela, there was a significant currency devaluation in the third quarter 2018. chevron has interests in venezuelan crude oil production assets operated by independent equity affiliates. the operating environment in venezuela has been deteriorating for some time. future events could result in the environment in venezuela becoming more challenged, which could lead to increased business disruption and volatility in the associated financial results.refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 30 and 31 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast and gulf coast of the united states and asia. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 31 and 32 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.29table of contentsoperating developmentsnoteworthy operating developments in recent months

and capital resourcescash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $9.7 billion at september 30, 2018 and $4.8 billion at year-end 2017. cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2018 was $21.5 billion, compared with $14.2 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting higher prices and production, partially offset by higher working capital requirements in the current period. cash capital and exploratory expenditures totaled $10.2 billion in the first nine months of 2018, up $96 million from the year-ago period. proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment totaled $1.9 billion and $244 million, respectively in the first nine months of 2018, compared to $4.6 billion and $162 million, respectively in the year ago period.dividends the company paid dividends of $6.4 billion to common stockholders during the first nine months of 2018. in october 2018, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per common share, payable in december 2018. debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $36.1 billion at september 30, 2018, down from $38.8 billion at december 31, 2017. the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the outstanding balance for the company's commercial paper program at september 30, 2018 was $7.3 billion. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $16.1 billion at september 30, 2018, and $15.2 billion at december 31, 2017. of these amounts, $10.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at both september 30, 2018, and december 31, 2017. at september 30, 2018, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at september 30, 2018, the company had $10.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. the credit facilities consist of a 364-day facility which enables borrowing of up to $9,575 million and allows the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, as well as a $425 million five-year facility expiring in december 2020. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at september 30, 2018. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in may 2021 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa- by standard and poor’s corporation and aa2 by moody’s investors service. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.common share repurchase program in july 2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. from the inception of the program through 2014, the company had purchased 180.9 million shares for $20.0 billion. no shares were acquired under the program in 2015 to 2017 or through the first six months of 2018. in july 2018, the company announced plans to initiate share repurchases. in third quarter 2018, the company repurchased 6.3 million shares for $750 million. repurchases may be made from37table of contentstime to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. the timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company's shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $1.1 billion at september 30, 2018, and $1.2 billion at december 31, 2017. there were distributions of $87 million to noncontrolling interests during the first nine months of 2018 compared to $66 million for the same period in 2017.current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. the current ratio was 1.2 at september 30, 2018, and 1.0 at december 31, 2017, respectively. the current ratio is adversely affected by the fact that chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. at september 30, 2018, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement cost.debt ratio total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity, which indicates the company’s leverage, was 19.0 percent at september 30, 2018, and 20.7 percent at year-end 2017.pension obligations information related to pension plan contributions is included on page 15 in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.capital and exploratory expenditures total expenditures, including the company’s share of spending by affiliates, were $14.3 billion in the first nine months of 2018, compared with $13.4 billion in the corresponding 2017 period. the amounts included the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $4.1 billion and $3.3 billion in the 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively, which did not require cash outlays by the company. expenditures for upstream projects in the first nine months of 2018 were $12.7 billion, representing 88 percent of the companywide total.capital and
