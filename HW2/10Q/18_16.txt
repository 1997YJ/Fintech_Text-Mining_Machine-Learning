item 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsour management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. md&a is organized as follows:•overview. discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of md&a.•results of operations. an analysis of our financial results comparing the three and six months ended june 29, 2013 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2012.•liquidity and capital resources. an analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity.•fair value of financial instruments. discussion of the methodologies used in the valuation of our financial instruments.this interim md&a should be read in conjunction with the md&a in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 29, 2012. the various sections of this md&a contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of our form 10-k, and as may be updated in our forms 10-q. our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of july 29, 2013.overviewour results of operations for each period were as follows: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) q2 2013 q1 2013 change q2 2013 q2 2012 changenet revenue $12,811 $12,580 $231 $12,811 $13,501 $(690)gross

our expectations that we provided in april. the increase from q1 2013 was driven by higher platform volumes partially offset by softness in our intel mobile communications business. we believe there was a small increase in inventory levels in the worldwide pc supply chain as our customers began building inventory of haswell-based pcs. compared to q2 2012 our revenue was down $690 million, or 5%, as pc client group platform unit volume decreased 5%.while the first half of 2013 was consistent with our expectations, we now expect 2013 revenue to be approximately flat compared to 2012. while macroeconomic conditions are expected to improve in the second half, the rate of recovery is slower than anticipated at the beginning of the year. in addition, the pc market segment is being negatively impacted by the growth in ultra-mobile devices such as tablets, and there is customer uncertainty about this trend and other technology transitions happening in the second half of the year. we have taken tactical actions to further reduce our expectations for capital expenditures in 2013 by $1.0 billion to $11.0 billion.  32intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)our gross margin percentage in q2 2013 increased two percentage points from q1 2013 on lower excess capacity charges and lower non-qualified product costs as the remaining platform variations of our 4th generation intel® core™ processor family (code-named “haswell”) qualified for sale in the second quarter. our gross margin percentage also benefited from sell-through of previously non-qualified units and higher notebook and data center platform volume. these increases were partially offset by higher factory start-up costs for our next generation 14nm process technology. our q3 2013 gross margin percentage is expected to be three percentage points higher when compared to q2 2013 as our next-generation intel®  atom™ processor-based soc for tablets (code-named “bay trail") are expected to qualify for sale resulting in lower non-qualified product costs. in addition, we expect higher platform volume, higher sell-through of previously non-qualified units, and lower factory start-up costs in q3 2013.we had significant product developments in the second quarter. we launched our 4th generation intel core processor family designed for notebooks (including ultrabook™ systems and convertibles), desktops, tablets and other touch-enabled devices. platform variations within this family of processors are able to deliver our most significant increase in power savings from a previous generation. we expect the volume of our platforms based on the 4th generation intel core processor family to ramp significantly in the second half of 2013. in the second quarter we also made significant progress in our tablet business with the announcement that the samsung galaxy* tab-3 10.1 inch tablet is powered by the intel® atom™ z2560 processor (code-named "clover trail+") and will be available with our multimode-multiband lte solution.our expected product introductions in the second half of 2013 demonstrate the strength of our product portfolio across market segments. we expect to launch our next-generation intel® atom™ microarchitecture platforms (code-named “silvermont”) designed for use in a variety of ultra-mobile form factors across various screen sizes and system price points in both traditional pcs and tablets (code-named “bay trail”) and smartphones (code-named “merrifield”). in the data center market segment, we expect that our next-generation intel atom microarchitecture platforms designed for use in the microserver market segment (code-named "avoton"), as well as our intel® xeon® processors manufactured using our 22nm process technology will both be shipping in the second half of 2013. this portfolio of product introductions is built on our increasing process technology manufacturing lead. building on this leadership, we expect to begin manufacturing platforms using our next-generation 14nm process technology by the end of 2013. our business continues to produce significant cash from operations, generating $4.7 billion in q2 2013. from a financial condition perspective, we ended q2 2013 with an investment portfolio of $17.4 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. during q2 2013, we purchased $2.7 billion in capital assets and returned cash to stockholders by paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $550 million of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. in july 2013, the board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share to be paid in september 2013. in the second quarter of 2013, brian krzanich became our chief executive officer and a member of intel's board of directors, succeeding paul s. otellini, who retired from the board and as ceo. during q2 2013, mr. krzanich made management organizational changes to enable greater focus and speed in decision making. these changes included flattening our senior leadership organizational structure and as a result the general managers of pc client group (pccg), data center group (dcg) and our other intel architecture operating segments now directly report to mr. krzanich. the management changes did not result in a change to the businesses comprising our operating segments. we continue to electively aggregate and disclose the financial results of our non-reportable operating segments (other intel architecture segments and software and services operating segments). in addition to the management organizational changes, we have re-directed resources to place greater emphasis on our intel atom microarchitecture-based products. these changes are important to our success in light of the increasing shift in market demand to ultra-mobile devices. with this increased emphasis on intel atom processors, we expect to move intel atom processors at an even faster pace to our leading edge silicon technology and focus on the soc integration of key components like graphics and communications.33intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)our business outlook for q3 2013 and full-year 2013 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general and administrative (mg&a)), and capital expenditures. we will keep our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10-q. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the business outlook and forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times. the forward-looking statements in the business outlook will be effective through the close of business on september 13, 2013 unless updated earlier. from the close of business on september 13, 2013 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for october 15, 2013, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet period, the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on july 17, 2013, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the sec, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.starting with the third quarter earnings announcement, we plan to post our quarterly earnings results on our investor relations website, at www.intc.com/results.cfm, and no longer distribute our quarterly financial results via a news wire service. results of operations – second quarter of 2013 compared to second quarter of 2012the

the decrease was driven by pccg and dcg platform volume which decreased 5% primarily on softness in traditional pc demand. pccg and dcg platform average selling prices were up 1%. our overall gross margin dollars for q2 2013 decreased $1.1 billion, or 13%, compared to q2 2012. the decrease was primarily due to $537 million of higher start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology and lower pccg and dcg platform revenue.34intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 58.3% in q2 2013 from 63.4% in q2 2012. the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in pccg. we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q2 2013 and q2 2012 from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg operating segments. pc client groupthe revenue and operating income for the pccg operating

respectively.pccg platform average selling prices were flat as 4% lower notebook platform average selling prices were offset by 6% higher desktop platform average selling prices.operating income decreased by $781 million, or 23%, in q2 2013 compared to q2 2012 driven by $853 million of lower gross margin, partially offset by $72 million of lower operating expenses. the decrease in gross margin was driven by $438 million of higher start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology and lower platform revenue. additionally, higher pre-qualification product costs contributed to the decrease. these decreases were partially offset by lower platform unit costs.data center groupthe revenue and operating income for the dcg operating segment for each period were as follows: (in

sales were up 1%, while dcg platform average selling prices were down 1%. our platform unit sales continued to benefit from significant growth in the internet cloud and high performance computing market segments. this was partially offset by lower unit sales in the enterprise market segment. operating income decreased by $135 million, or 10%, in q2 2013 compared to q2 2012 driven by $175 million of lower gross margin partially offset by $40 million of lower operating expenses. gross margin was negatively impacted by higher platform unit cost and $74 million of higher start-up costs for our next generation 14nm process technology.35intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)other intel architecture operating

cash and cash equivalents $(4,700) $158operating activitiescash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.cash from operations in the first six months of 2013 was $9.0 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to the first six months of 2012 due to changes in our working capital, partially offset by lower net income in the first six months of 2013. income taxes paid, net of refunds, in the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012 were $1.1 billion lower due to lower income before taxes in 2013 and 2012 income tax overpayments.changes in assets and liabilities as of june 29, 2013 compared to december 29, 2012 included the following:•accrued compensation and benefits decreased due to the payout of 2012 profit-dependent compensation.•accounts receivable decreased due to lower revenue in the first six months of 2013.in the first six months of 2013, our three largest customers accounted for 42% of net revenue (41% in the first six months of 2012) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 16% of our net revenue (17% in the first six months of 2012), dell inc. accounting for 15% of our net revenue (14% in the first six months of 2012), and lenovo group limited accounting for 11% of our net revenue (10% in the first six months of 2012). these three customers accounted for 30% of net accounts receivable as of june 29, 2013 (33% as of december 29, 2012).investing activitiesthe increase in cash used for investing activities in the first six months of 2013, compared to the first six months of 2012, was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in the first six months of 2013, as compared to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in the first six months of 2012.financing activitiesthe decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first six months of 2013, compared to the first six months of 2012, was due to lower repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in the first six months of 2013, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans.liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of june 29, 2013, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $17.4 billion ($18.2 billion as of december 29, 2012). in addition to the $17.4 billion, we have $2.6 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.42intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first six months of 2013. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of june 29, 2013. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.as of june 29, 2013, $10.3 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $10.3 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $1.9 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of june 29, 2013. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 2: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of june 29, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $18.4 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $6.6 billion was classified as level 1, $11.3 billion as level 2, and $492 million as level 3.our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $11.3 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 60% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 40% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when observable market data is not available, we corroborate our fair value measurements using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes from a second source.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of june 29, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $781 million of loans receivable and $100 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.43intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)marketable equity securitiesas of june 29, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $5.4 billion of marketable equity securities. all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.44
