third quarter of fiscal 2013, we reported net earnings of $1.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.95 compared to net earnings of $947 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first nine months of fiscal 2013, we reported net earnings of $4.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.02 compared to net earnings of $3.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.32 for the first nine months of fiscal 2012.the results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a total charge of $165 million, net of tax, related to the closing of our remaining seven big box stores in china ("china store closings") in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, which had a negative impact of $0.11 to diluted earnings per share. excluding the charges related to the china store closings, net earnings were $1.1 billion and $3.7 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $0.74 and $2.43 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012, respectively.net sales increased 7.4% to $19.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 from $18.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first nine months of fiscal 2013, net sales increased 8.2% to $61.1 billion from $56.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. our comparable store sales increased 7.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket. in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013, we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives:customer service – our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first and simplifying the business. during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we expanded our first phones' functionality to process buy online, pick-up in store ("bopis") and buy online, ship to store ("boss") orders. these enhancements to the first phone now allow our associates to close these types of transactions immediately from wherever they are in the store. also in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we launched a mobile application specifically designed for our professional customers. this mobile application enables professional customers to see multiple stores' inventory at one time, provides them with direct access to our professional desks, tracks receipts and provides functionality that can help them better manage their businesses. 11table of contentsproduct authority – our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering innovation, assortment and value. as part of this effort, we introduced innovative new products and great values for both our professional and do-it-yourself customers in a variety of departments. at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we had approximately 400 stores with enhanced appliance showrooms, a reset we began last year. we also have an expanded assortment available online. as a result, we experienced double digit growth for appliances, both in store and online, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.disciplined capital allocation, productivity and efficiency – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, we continued to make improvements to our forecasting and replenishment systems, helping our business to react to and recover from sales spikes while keeping inventory under control. our inventory turnover ratio was 4.7 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 4.6 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2012. during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we settled a $1.7 billion accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement that was entered into in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. we received a total of approximately 22.0 million shares under the $1.7 billion asr agreement in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, including approximately 2.4 million shares received upon settlement of the agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. also during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into a $1.5 billion asr agreement. we received an initial delivery of approximately 16.4 million shares in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 under the $1.5 billion asr agreement. in addition to the asr, we repurchased approximately 22.9 million shares of our common stock in the open market during the first nine months of fiscal 2013. interconnected retail – our focus on interconnected retail is based on building a competitive platform across all commerce channels. during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we continued to enhance our website and mobile presence. we added enhanced communication for order delivery, refreshed category pages, simplified the check-out process and invested across interconnected retail to improve the customer experience. both traffic to our website and our online sales conversion rate grew by double digit amounts in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. sales from our online channels increased over 50% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 and now represent approximately three percent of our total net sales.we opened two new stores in mexico during the third quarter of fiscal 2013, for a total store count of 2,260 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013, a total of 283 of our stores, or 12.5%, were located in canada and mexico.we generated $6.0 billion of cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2013. this cash flow, along with $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and $3.25 billion of long-term debt issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, was used in part to fund $6.4 billion of share repurchases, pay $1.7 billion of dividends and fund $964 million in capital expenditures.our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 19.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 16.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012.12table of

applicable13table of contentsresults of operationsnet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 increased 7.4% to $19.5 billion from $18.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first nine months of fiscal 2013, net sales increased 8.2% to $61.1 billion from $56.5 billion for the comparable period of fiscal 2012. the increase in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. total comparable store sales increased 7.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to an increase of 4.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first nine months of fiscal 2013, total comparable store sales increased 7.6% compared to an increase of 3.9% for the same period of fiscal 2012. the positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, strong sales in our appliance business, continued strength in our maintenance, repair and décor categories, and an improved u.s. housing market. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013, and comparable store average ticket increased 2.8% and 4.0% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013, respectively, due in part to continued recovery in professional customer sales. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 4.5% and 3.5% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013, respectively. comparable store sales for our kitchen, lighting, décor, lumber, electrical, indoor garden, paint and bath product categories were above the company average for the third quarter of fiscal 2013.gross profit increased 8.5% to $6.8 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 from $6.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. gross profit increased 8.8% to $21.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 from $19.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. gross profit for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the china store closings. gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 35 basis points to 34.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 34.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. excluding the charge related to the china store closings, gross profit margin increased 30 basis points for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. for the first nine months of fiscal 2013, gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.7% compared to 34.5% for the comparable period of fiscal 2012, an increase of 21 basis points. the increase in gross profit margin for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by higher productivity in our supply chain, our recently acquired businesses, which are gross margin accretive, and improved shrink performance, partially offset by a change in mix of products sold. selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") were $4.1 billion for the third quarter of both fiscal 2013 and 2012, and increased 2.3% to $12.6 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 from $12.3 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. sg&a for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a $155 million charge related to the china store closings. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 21.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 22.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. excluding the charge related to the china store closings, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 22.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first nine months of fiscal 2013, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 20.6% compared to 21.8% for the same period last year. excluding the charge related to the china store closings, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 21.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls.depreciation and amortization increased 3.5% to $409 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 from $395 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. depreciation and amortization was $1.2 billion for the first nine months of both fiscal 2013 and  2012. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 2.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 2.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012, and was 2.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 compared to 2.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment, offset by higher depreciation related to capital expenditures that in recent years have been more heavily weighted toward technology assets, which have shorter depreciable lives.operating income increased 32.3% to $2.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 from $1.7 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. operating income increased 23.1% to $7.4 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 from $6.0 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. excluding the charges related to the china store closings, operating income increased 20.8%  and 19.8% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013, respectively.for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we recognized $188 million of interest and other, net, compared to $150 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. we recognized $521 million of interest and other, net, for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 compared to $385 million for the same period last year. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 0.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first nine months of fiscal 2013, interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.9% compared to 0.7% for the same period last year. the increase in interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 reflects increased interest expense 14table of contentsassociated with the april 2013 and september 2013 notes issuances. interest and other, net, for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of hd supply, inc.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 compared to 37.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. the effective income tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was lower than the same period of fiscal 2012 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $165 million of charges related to the china store closings for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. excluding the charges related to the china store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2012.diluted earnings per share were $0.95 and $3.02 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013, respectively, compared to $0.63 and $2.32 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012, respectively. excluding the charges related to the china store closings, diluted earnings per share were $0.74 and $2.43 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012, respectively. diluted earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2013 reflect $0.05 and $0.14, respectively, of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended november 3, 2013.to provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with non-gaap financial measures to reflect certain adjustments. the results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a $165 million charge, net of tax, related to the china store closings as described more fully in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. there were no adjustments for the third quarter or first nine months of fiscal 2013 for events of unusual nature or frequency. we believe these non-gaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. the following reconciles the non-gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measures for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 (amounts in millions, except per share

months of fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.0 billion compared to $5.4 billion for the same period in fiscal 2012. this increase is primarily due to a $858 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls. net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was $945 million compared to $987 million for the same period in fiscal 2012. this change was primarily due to a $106 million decrease in payments for businesses acquired, partially offset by a $77 million increase in capital expenditures in the first nine months of fiscal 2013 compared to the same period last year.net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2013 was $2.7 billion compared to $3.8 billion for the same period of fiscal 2012. this change was primarily the result of $5.2 billion in net proceeds from long-term borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, partially offset by $3.1 billion more in repurchases of common stock, $533 million less in proceeds from the sale of common stock and $387 million more in cash dividends paid to stockholders in the first nine months of fiscal 2013 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2012.in april 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.70% senior notes due april 1, 2023 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 4.20% senior notes due april 1, 2043 at a discount of $4 million (together, the "april 2013 issuance"). interest on these notes is 15table of contentsdue semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2013. the net proceeds of the april 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.in september 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 2.25% senior notes due september 10, 2018 (the “2018 notes”) at a discount of $1 million, $1.1 billion of 3.75% senior notes due february 15, 2024 (the “2024 notes”) at a discount of $6 million and $1.0 billion of 4.875% senior notes due february 15, 2044 (the “2044 notes”) at a discount of $15 million (together, the "september 2013 issuance"). interest on the 2018 notes is due semi-annually on march 10 and september 10 of each year, beginning march 10, 2014. interest on the 2024 notes and the 2044 notes is due semi-annually on february 15 and august 15 of each year, beginning february 15, 2014. the net proceeds of the september 2013 issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of our $1.25 billion 5.25% senior notes due december 16, 2013 and repurchases of shares of our common stock. in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.5 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 18.1 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. the transaction was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, at which time we received approximately 2.1 million additional shares. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.5 billion asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement.in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.7 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.7 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 19.6 million shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. the transaction was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, at which time we received approximately 2.4 million additional shares. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.7 billion asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement.in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.5 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 16.4 million shares in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.5 billion asr agreement entered into in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement.in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, we also repurchased approximately 22.9 million additional shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion in the open market. as of the end of the first nine months of fiscal 2013, $10.6 billion remained under the $17.0 billion share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in february 2013. we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. as of november 3, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. the credit facility expires in july 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. as of november 3, 2013, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.as of november 3, 2013, we had $4.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.16table of contents
