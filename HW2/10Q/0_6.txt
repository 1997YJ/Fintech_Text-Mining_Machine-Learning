innovative products and technologies.22business seasonality and product introductionsthe company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the company’s fiscal year 2017 will include 53 weeks and will end on september 30, 2017. a 14th week has been included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.first quarter fiscal 2017 highlightsnet sales grew 3% or $2.5 billion during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily driven by strong growth in iphone and services, partially offset by lower ipad sales. the positive impact of having an additional week in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily offset by lower year-over-year channel inventory growth, an earlier launch of iphone 7 and 7 plus as compared to the prior year and the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. during the first quarter of 2017, the company introduced a new macbook pro® with touch bar™, an interface that replaces the traditional row of function keys, and released airpods™, which are new wireless headphones.sales datathe following table shows net sales by

both north and south america. the europe segment includes european countries, as well as india, the middle east and africa. the greater china segment includes china, hong kong and taiwan. the rest of asia pacific segment includes australia and those asian countries not included in the company’s other reportable operating segments. although the reportable operating segments provide similar hardware

margin$30,176 $30,423gross margin percentage38.5% 40.1%gross margin decreased during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 due primarily to higher product cost structures and the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services.the company anticipates gross margin during the second quarter of 2017 to be between 38% and 39%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.26operating expensesoperating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in

quarter in 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, and material costs to support expanded r&d activities. the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products that are central to the company’s core business strategy. selling, general and administrativethe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses and higher variable selling costs, partially offset by lower advertising costs.other income/(expense), netother income/(expense), net for the first quarter of 2017

primarily to higher interest income and foreign exchange gains, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. the weighted-average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.87% and 1.65% in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.provision for income taxesprovision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions): three months ended december 31, 2016 december 26, 2015provision for income taxes$6,289 $6,212effective tax rate26.0% 25.3%the company’s effective tax rates during the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, for which no u.s. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the higher year-over-year effective tax rate during the first quarter of 2017 was due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit during the first quarter of 2016.27the company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. while the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission's guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by ireland, the company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes. recent accounting pronouncementsrestricted cashin november 2016, the financial accounting standards board (“fasb”) issued accounting standards update (“asu”) no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash (“asu 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. the company will adopt asu 2016-18 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the retrospective adoption method. currently, the company's restricted cash balance is not significant.income taxesin october 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory (“asu 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. the company will adopt asu 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. currently, the company anticipates recording up to $9 billion of net deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheets. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date. the company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these deferred tax assets are utilized.stock compensationin march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, compensation – stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting (“asu 2016-09”), which modifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards, and classification in the statement of cash flows. the company will adopt asu 2016-09 in its first quarter of 2018. currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the company's equity awards are recorded as additional paid-in capital in its consolidated balance sheets. upon adoption, the company will record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards in its consolidated statements of operations in the reporting periods in which vesting occurs. as a result, subsequent to adoption the company's income tax expense and associated effective tax rate will be impacted by fluctuations in stock price between the grant dates and vesting dates of equity awards.leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (“asu 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. asu 2016-02 will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted. the company will use a modified retrospective adoption approach. while the company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting asu 2016-02, currently the company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $7.5 billion on its consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact to its consolidated statements of operations. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-02 will depend on the company's lease portfolio as of the adoption date.financial instruments in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01, financial instruments – overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities (“asu 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. based on the composition of the company's investment portfolio, the adoption of asu 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.28in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, financial instruments – credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (“asu 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. based on the composition of the company's investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of asu 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (“asu 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. asu 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.subsequently, the fasb has issued the following standards related to asu 2014-09: asu no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (“asu 2016-08”); asu no. 2016-10, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): identifying performance obligations and licensing (“asu 2016-10”); asu no. 2016-12, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (“asu 2016-12”); and asu no. 2016-20, technical corrections and improvements to topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers (“asu 2016-20”). the company must adopt asu 2016-08, asu 2016-10, asu 2016-12 and asu 2016-20 with asu 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”).the new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. the company currently expects to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2018 utilizing the full retrospective adoption method. the new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the company's consolidated financial statements.liquidity and capital resourcesthe following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of december 31, 2016 and

equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. the company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going u.s. operating activities and from borrowings. as of december 31, 2016 and september 24, 2016, the company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $230.2 billion and $216.0 billion, respectively, and are generally based in u.s. dollar-denominated holdings. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. in connection with the state aid decision, the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest. the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission's guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by ireland, the company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.29during the three months ended december 31, 2016, cash generated from operating activities of $27.1 billion was a result of $17.9 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $5.4 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.7 billion. cash used in investing activities of $19.1

entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and

higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often, channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the company’s fiscal year 2017 will include 53 weeks and will end on september 30, 2017. a 14th week has been included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.first quarter fiscal 2017 highlightsnet sales grew 3% or $2.5 billion during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily driven by strong growth in iphone and services, partially offset by lower ipad sales. the positive impact of having an additional week in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily offset by lower year-over-year channel inventory growth, an earlier launch of iphone 7 and 7 plus as compared to the prior year and the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. during the first quarter of 2017, the company introduced a new macbook pro® with touch bar™, an interface that replaces the traditional row of function keys, and released airpods™, which are new wireless headphones.sales datathe following table shows net sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product for the three months ended december 31, 2016 and december 26, 2015 (dollars in

quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 due primarily to higher product cost structures and the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services.the company anticipates gross margin during the second quarter of 2017 to be between 38% and 39%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.26operating expensesoperating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions): three months ended december 31, 2016 december 26, 2015research and

and material costs to support expanded r&d activities. the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products that are central to the company’s core business strategy. selling, general and administrativethe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses and higher variable selling costs, partially offset

interest expense on debt. the weighted-average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.87% and 1.65% in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.provision for income taxesprovision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions): three months ended december 31, 2016 december 26, 2015provision for income taxes$6,289 $6,212effective tax rate26.0% 25.3%the company’s effective tax rates during the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, for which no u.s. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the higher year-over-year effective tax rate during the first quarter of 2017 was due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit during the first quarter of 2016.27the company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. while the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission's guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by ireland, the company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes. recent accounting pronouncementsrestricted cashin november 2016, the financial accounting standards board (“fasb”) issued accounting standards update (“asu”) no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash (“asu 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. the company will adopt asu 2016-18 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the retrospective adoption method. currently, the company's restricted cash balance is not significant.income taxesin october 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory (“asu 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset,
