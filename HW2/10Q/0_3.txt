in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the first quarter of 2018 spanned 13 weeks, whereas a 14th week was added to the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.first quarter fiscal 2018 highlightsnet sales increased 13% or $9.9 billion during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017, primarily driven by growth in iphone, other products and services. the year-over-year increase in net sales reflected growth in all of the company’s geographic reportable segments. the company began shipping iphone x in november 2017 and imac pro™ in december 2017.the company spent $10.1 billion to

margin$33,912 $30,176gross margin percentage38.4% 38.5%gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 was relatively flat.the company anticipates gross margin percentage during the second quarter of 2018 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; product transitions; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.apple inc. | q1 2018 form 10-q | 25operating expensesoperating expenses for the three months ended december 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016 were as follows (dollars in

quarter in 2017 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded r&d activities. the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company’s core business strategy.selling, general and administrativethe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 was driven primarily by higher spending on marketing and advertising, and an increase in infrastructure-related costs.other income/(expense), netother income/(expense), net for the three months ended december 30, 2017 and

income, net38 122  total other income/(expense), net$756 $821 (8)%the decrease in other income/(expense), net during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 was due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange-related items and higher interest expense on debt, partially offset by higher interest income and realized gains on sales of marketable securities. the weighted-average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.11% and 1.87% in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.provision for income taxesprovision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the three months ended december 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions): three months ended december 30, 2017 december 31, 2016provision for income taxes$6,965 $6,289effective tax rate25.8% 26.0%apple inc. | q1 2018 form 10-q | 26on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the “act”), which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the act lowered the company’s u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on deferred foreign income. by operation of law, the company will apply a blended u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018. the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings.the company’s effective tax rate of 25.8% for the first quarter of 2018 differs from the blended rate of 24.5% due primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by the impact of taxes on foreign earnings. the company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 is slightly lower than the first quarter of 2017 due to the lower u.s. statutory blended tax rate, primarily offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.the company anticipates its effective tax rate for the remainder of 2018 to be approximately 15%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected effective tax rate during 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future expected tax rate can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors.”the company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 differed from the u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, for which no u.s. taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.the company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. although ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the company expects the amount to be in line with the european commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. once the recovery amount is finalized by ireland, the company anticipates funding it by placing amounts into escrow in 2018, pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes.recent accounting pronouncementshedgingin august 2017, the financial accounting standards board (“fasb”) issued accounting standards update (“asu”) no. 2017-12, derivatives and hedging (topic 815): targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities (“asu 2017-12”). asu 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. the company will adopt asu 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.restricted cashin november 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash (“asu 2016-18”), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. the company will adopt asu 2016-18 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the retrospective transition method. currently, the company’s restricted cash balance is not significant.apple inc. | q1 2018 form 10-q | 27income taxesin october 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory (“asu 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. the company will adopt asu 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. currently, the company estimates recording up to $4 billion of net deferred tax assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date, as well as the deferred tax impact of the minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. the company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (“asu 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. the company will adopt asu 2016-02 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. while the company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting asu 2016-02, currently the company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $9.6 billion on its condensed consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact to its condensed consolidated statements of operations. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-02 will depend on the company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.financial instruments in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01, financial instruments – overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities (“asu 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. based on the composition of the company’s investment portfolio, the adoption of asu 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, financial instruments – credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (“asu 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. based on the composition of the company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of asu 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (“asu 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. asu 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.subsequently, the fasb has issued the following standards related to asu 2014-09: asu no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (“asu 2016-08”); asu no. 2016-10, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): identifying performance obligations and licensing (“asu 2016-10”); asu no. 2016-12, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (“asu 2016-12”); and asu no. 2016-20, technical corrections and improvements to topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers (“asu 2016-20”). the company must adopt asu 2016-08, asu 2016-10, asu 2016-12 and asu 2016-20 with asu 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”).the new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. the company will adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. the new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements.apple inc. | q1 2018 form 10-q | 28liquidity and capital resourcesthe following tables present selected

recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. once the recovery amount is finalized by ireland, the company anticipates funding it by placing amounts into escrow in 2018, pending conclusion of all appeals.the company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit

related interest and penalties of $6.8 billion. the company plans to pay the tax payable in installments in accordance with the act. the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.indemnificationagreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.the company offers an iphone upgrade program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iphone in the u.s., the u.k. and mainland china. the iphone upgrade program provides customers the right to trade in that iphone for a specified

these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. while the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.note 1, “summary of significant accounting policies” in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k, and “critical accounting policies and estimates” in part ii, item 7 of the 2017 form 10-k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. with the exception of income taxes, there have been no material changes to the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 form 10-k.apple inc. | q1 2018 form 10-q | 31income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the company’s deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the act, which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the act lowered the company’s u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on deferred foreign income. the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. during the first quarter of 2018, the company recognized a provision for income taxes of $7.0 billion, of which $2.6 billion was considered a provisional estimate under the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118. the company’s provisional estimate of $2.6 billion included $1.8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect the new tax rate and approximately $800 million, net, associated with the deemed repatriation tax. resolution of the provisional estimates of the act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.item

in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. product introductions can also impact the company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches. net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. however, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the company’s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.fiscal periodthe company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last saturday of september. the first quarter of 2018 spanned 13 weeks, whereas a

margin percentage during the second quarter of 2018 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors” and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures; increased competition; the company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; product transitions; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; and a potential shift in the company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. due to the company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.apple inc. | q1 2018 form 10-q | 25operating expensesoperating expenses for the three months ended december 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016 were as follows (dollars in

the impact of foreign exchange-related items and higher interest expense on debt, partially offset by higher interest income and realized gains on sales of marketable securities. the weighted-average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.11% and 1.87% in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.provision for income taxesprovision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the three months ended december 30, 2017 and december 31, 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions): three months ended december 30, 2017 december 31, 2016provision for income taxes$6,965 $6,289effective tax rate25.8% 26.0%apple inc. | q1 2018 form 10-q | 26on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the “act”), which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the act lowered the company’s u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on deferred foreign income. by operation of law, the company will apply a blended u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018. the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings.the company’s effective tax rate of 25.8% for the first quarter of 2018 differs from the blended rate of 24.5% due primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by the impact of taxes on foreign earnings. the company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 is slightly lower than the first quarter of 2017 due to the lower u.s. statutory blended tax rate, primarily offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.the company anticipates its effective tax rate for the remainder of 2018 to be approximately 15%. the foregoing statement regarding the company’s expected effective tax rate during 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company’s future expected tax rate can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q under the heading “risk factors.”the company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 differed from the u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, for which no u.s. taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s.the company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the “state aid decision”). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through december 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of january 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and appealed to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also appealed the state aid decision. although ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the company expects the amount to be in line with the european commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. once the recovery amount is finalized by ireland, the company anticipates funding it by placing amounts into escrow in 2018, pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the state aid decision would be creditable against u.s. taxes.recent accounting

consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. the company will adopt asu 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. currently, the company estimates recording up to $4 billion of net deferred tax assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date, as well as the deferred tax impact of the minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. the company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (“asu 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for

while the company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting asu 2016-02, currently the company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $9.6 billion on its condensed consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact to its condensed consolidated statements of operations. however, the ultimate impact of adopting asu 2016-02 will depend on the company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.financial instruments in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01, financial instruments – overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities (“asu 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. based on the composition of the company’s investment portfolio, the adoption of asu 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, financial instruments – credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (“asu 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. the company will adopt asu 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. based on the composition of the company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of asu 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (“asu 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. asu 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.subsequently, the fasb has issued the following standards related to asu 2014-09: asu no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (“asu 2016-08”); asu no. 2016-10, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): identifying performance obligations and licensing

improvements to topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers (“asu 2016-20”). the company must adopt asu 2016-08, asu 2016-10, asu 2016-12 and asu 2016-20 with asu 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”).the new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. the company will adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. the new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on

related interest and penalties of $6.8 billion. the company plans to pay the tax payable in installments in accordance with the act. the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments related to unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.indemnificationagreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.the company offers an iphone upgrade program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iphone in the u.s., the u.k. and mainland china. the iphone upgrade program provides customers the right to trade in that iphone for a specified

these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. while the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.critical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.note 1, “summary of significant accounting policies” in part i, item 1 of this form 10-q and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of the 2017 form 10-k, and “critical accounting policies and estimates” in part ii, item 7 of the 2017 form 10-k describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. with the exception of income taxes, there have been no material changes to the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2017 form 10-k.apple inc. | q1 2018 form 10-q | 31income taxesthe company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the company’s deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the act, which significantly changed u.s. tax law. the act lowered the company’s u.s. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on deferred foreign income. the act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. during the first quarter of 2018, the company recognized a provision for income taxes of $7.0 billion, of which $2.6 billion was considered a provisional estimate under the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118. the company’s provisional estimate of $2.6 billion included $1.8 billion related to the impact of remeasuring the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect the new tax rate and approximately $800 million, net, associated with the deemed repatriation tax. resolution of the provisional estimates of the act’s effects different from the assumptions made by the company could have a material impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results.
