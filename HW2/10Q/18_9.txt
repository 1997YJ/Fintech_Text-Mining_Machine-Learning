exchange commission (sec) on june 5, 2015. the various sections of this md&a contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "goals," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "may," "will," "should," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of our annual report on form 10-k, and as may be updated in our subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q. our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations, including our definitive agreement with altera corporation (altera) as discussed in “note 7: acquisitions” in the notes to the consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q, that had not been completed as of october 28, 2015.37intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)overviewour

rate 26.9% 9.3% 17.6% 26.9% 27.1% (0.2)%our q3 2015 net revenue of $14.5 billion was flat from q3 2014 and above the midpoint of the business outlook provided in july 2015. while net revenue was flat, client computing group (ccg) unit sales decreased, primarily on lower desktop and notebook platforms unit sales, offset by higher ccg average selling price, data center group (dcg) platform revenue, and non-volatile memory solutions group revenue. continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment and the overall pc market drove lower demand in the non-consumer segment and emerging markets. despite this trend, we continue to invigorate our performance product lines, resulting in higher demand and consequently higher average selling prices. we are seeing signs of a stabilizing pc market and our strategy to offer complete and connected computing solutions is delivering growth which is largely offsetting the lower demand of the traditional pc business. dcg posted record net revenue and non-volatile memory solutions group and internet of things group (iotg) net revenue all grew double digit year-over-year.gross margin decreased by 2% points from q3 2014 and in-line with our previous business outlook of 63%. the decrease from q3 2014 was primarily due to higher platform unit costs and lower platform unit sales. these decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices and lower production costs on 14nm which were treated as a period charge in q3 2014. as compared to q3 2014, operating income of $4.2 billion was down 8%, net income of $3.1 billion was down 6%, and earnings per share of $0.64 was down 2 cents. in q3 2015, we started shipping our 6th generation intel® core™ processor family, formerly code-named "skylake".  we see our partners in the industry are combining our 6th generation intel core processor and microsoft windows 10* to drive innovation, creating new user experiences and providing more secure computing. the new 6th generation intel core processor is also enabling thinner designs, faster startup time, and better battery life. we introduced 3d xpoint™ technology in july 2015, a non-volatile memory that has the potential to revolutionize devices, applications or services that benefits from fast access to large sets of data, which was jointly developed with micron technology, inc. now in production, 3d xpoint technology combines the performance, density, power, non-volatility and cost advantages of existing nand and conventional memories like dram technologies on the market today.in q2 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera. as of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion. while we expect to close this transaction within six to nine months from the date of the agreement, , it is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. for further information, see "note 7: acquisitions" in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.our business continues to generate significant cash with $5.7 billion of cash from operations in q3 2015. during q3 2015, we purchased $1.2 billion in capital assets and returned cash to stockholders by both paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.0 billion of common stock through our stock repurchase program. additionally, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in september 2015 of $0.24 per share of common stock to be paid in december 2015. we ended q3 2015 with $20.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets, which represented a $7.0 billion increase compared to q2 2015, primarily driven by new long-term debt issued during q3 2015 as part of our plan to finance our pending acquisition of altera. for further information, see "note 13: borrowings" in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q. 38intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)for q4 2015, we are forecasting a revenue midpoint of $14.8 billion, up 2% from q3 2015. this forecast is in-line with the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter. we are forecasting q4 2015 gross margin midpoint of 62%, down 1% from q3 2015 as we continue to transition to 14nm process technology. we are now expecting the midpoint of our capital spending for full year 2015 to be $7.3 billion, down $400 million from the midpoint of our previous business outlook of $7.7 billion. for the full year 2015, dcg and iotg will exhibit strong growth but the annual growth rate for these businesses will be lower than our expectations at the beginning of the year as a result of weaker-than-expected macroeconomic growth. we now expect dcg business to grow in the low double digits versus the prior forecast of approximately fifteen percent. relative to our forecast at the beginning of the year, we are seeing weakness in the enterprise market segment being partially offset by a stronger than expected cloud market segment. our business outlook for q4 2015 and full-year 2015 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general, and administrative (mg&a)), and capital expenditures. we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release. our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10-q. the statements in the business outlook and forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and filings with the sec and at other times. the forward-looking statements in the business outlook and reiterated or updated in this form 10-q will be effective through the close of business on december 11, 2015 unless updated earlier or except as specifically noted otherwise in the business outlook. from the close of business on december 11, 2015 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for january 14, 2016, we will observe a “quiet period.”during the quiet period, the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on october 13, 2015, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the sec, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be considered historical, speaking prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize

common share $0.64   $0.66  note: we have updated our presentation to reflect platforms sold through the client computing group, the data center group, and the internet of things group (platform).our net revenue for q3 2015 was flat compared to q3 2014. total platform unit sales decreased by 17%, driven by the challenging macroeconomic conditions in the current period. in addition, q3 2014 included higher pc demand driven by microsoft windows* xp refresh and higher tablet volume as we ramped the tablet platform business. most of this decrease was offset by higher platform average selling prices of 19%. the increase in platform average selling prices was driven by a higher proportion of unit sales from dcg platforms, a lower proportion of tablet and phone platform unit sales (which has a lower average selling price), as well as higher average selling prices for the desktop, dcg, and notebook platforms. to a lesser extent, higher non-volatile memory solutions group revenue partially offset the decrease in revenue driven by lower total platform unit sales.our overall gross margin dollars for q3 2015 decreased by $347 million, or 4%, compared to q3 2014. this decrease was due to $930 million of higher platform unit costs as our 14nm products constituted a higher proportion of our platform unit sales. the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by higher platform revenue which impacted gross margin by approximately $265 million as well as approximately $155 million of lower production costs on our 14nm products which were treated as a period charge in q3 2014.our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 63.0% in q3 2015 from 65.0% in q3 2014. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin decrease in the ccg operating segment. we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2015 and q3 2014 from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments.40intel

approximately $915 million on higher ccg platform unit costs. to a lesser extent, the impact to gross margin on lower ccg platform revenue was approximately $225 million. lower ccg platform revenue was driven by lower ccg platform unit sales. lower ccg platform revenue was partially offset by higher ccg platform average selling prices driven by the benefit of lower tablet and phone platform unit sales (which have a lower average selling price) and higher desktop and notebook platform average selling prices. the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by approximately $215 million of

approved and commenced implementation of several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. these actions include the wind down of our 200 millimeter wafer fabrication facility in massachusetts, which ceased production in q1 2015, and the closure of our assembly and test facility in costa rica, which ceased production in q4 2014. these targeted reductions will enable us to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the current business environment. we expect these actions to be substantially

arrangements for approximately 8,700 employees, and $77 million in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges.we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges incurred to date as

in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014 primarily due to higher gains on third-party merger transactions offset by higher equity method losses and lower gains on exits.we recognized an interest and other, net loss in the first nine months of 2015 compared to a net gain in the first nine months of 2014. we recognized a net loss in the first nine months of 2015 primarily due to interest expense which now includes the q3 2015 issuance of our $8.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. for further information, see "note 13: borrowings." we recognized a net gain in the first nine months of 2014 primarily due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our intel media assets in q1 2014.48provision for taxesour provision for taxes and

decrease in our effective tax rate between the first nine months of 2015 and the first nine months of 2014 was driven by the following q2 2015 events: the settlement of a one-time refund claim involving asset tax basis resulting in the recognition of a $320 million tax benefit and our decision during 2015 to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years' non-u.s. earnings resulting in the release of $185 million previously accrued u.s. deferred taxes. in addition, a higher proportion of our income from lower taxed jurisdictions positively impacted our effective income tax rate.liquidity and capital resources(dollars in millions) sep 26, 2015 dec 27, 2014cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets $20,843 $14,054other long-term

operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.for the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014, the $1.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operations was due to adjustments to net income for non-cash items and changes in working capital. the adjustments to net income were lower due to deferred taxes, partially offset by higher depreciation. changes in assets and liabilities as of september 26, 2015, compared to december 27, 2014, included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits due to the payout of 2014 profit-dependent compensation and an increase in inventories due to the ramp of our 5th generation intel core processor family of products, partially offset by an income taxes net payable resulting from income tax payments made in 2014.49intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)for the first nine months of 2015, our three largest customers accounted for 46% of net revenue (46% for the first nine months of 2014) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 18% of our net revenue (18% for the first nine months of 2014), dell inc. accounting for 15% of our net revenue (16% for the first nine months of 2014), and lenovo group limited accounting for 13% of our net revenue (12% for the first nine months of 2014). these three customers accounted for 43% of net accounts receivable as of september 26, 2015 (43% as of december 27, 2014).investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.cash used for investing activities was higher for the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014. cash used for investing activities increased primarily due to lower maturities of available-for-sale investments, higher originations of loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements, and higher purchases of available-for-sale investments. this increase was partially offset by lower additions to property, plant and equipment, lower purchases of trading assets, and higher maturities and sales of trading assets.financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.cash was provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2015 compared to cash used by financing activities for the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt and fewer repurchases of common stock in 2015.liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of september 26, 2015, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $20.8 billion ($14.1 billion as of december 27, 2014). in addition to the $20.8 billion, we have $2.7 billion of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months, $1.8 billion of other long-term investments, and $1.2 billion of loans receivable and other investments, that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3.another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion, which our board of directors increased from $3.0 billion during q2 2015. this ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $900 million during the first nine months of 2015 and no commercial paper remained outstanding as of september 26, 2015. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of september 26, 2015. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. in q3 2015, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $8.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. these notes were issued primarily to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our pending acquisition of altera. for further information on the terms of the notes, see “note 13: borrowings” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q. as of september 26, 2015, $10.1 billion of our $20.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $10.1 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $434 million was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of september 26, 2015. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.50intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)during q2 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera in an all-cash transaction expected to close within six to nine months from the date of the agreement. as of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion. we intend to finance the acquisition through a combination of $7.0 billion to $9.0 billion in long-term debt, including the notes issued during q3 2015, described in note 13: borrowings, and the remainder with commercial paper and cash and investments. the timing, amount and terms of any additional debt financing are subject to market and other conditions. we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 3: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of september 26, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $21.3 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $4.6 billion was classified as level 1, $16.5 billion as level 2, and $92 million as level 3.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $16.5 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 70% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 30% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of september 26, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $490 million of loans receivable and $668 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of september 26, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $5.6 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.51intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)contractual obligationspending acquisition of altera corporationduring q2 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera in an all-cash transaction expected to close within six to nine months from the date of the agreement. the acquisition will couple intel’s leading-edge products and manufacturing process with altera’s leading field-programmable gate array technology. the combination is expected to enable new classes of products that meet customer needs in the data center and internet of things market segments. upon completion of the acquisition, each outstanding share of altera common stock and, subject to certain exceptions, each share of altera common stock underlying vested stock option awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance-based restricted stock unit awards will be converted into the right to receive $54.00 per share in cash, without interest. as of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion. this transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. we intend to finance the acquisition through a combination of $7.0 billion to $9.0 billion in long-term debt, including the notes issued during q3 2015, described in note 13: borrowings, and the remainder with commercial paper and cash and investments. the timing, amount and terms of any additional debt financing are subject to market and other conditions.investment in beijing unispreadtrum technology ltd.during 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with tsinghua unigroup ltd. (tsinghua unigroup), an operating subsidiary of tsinghua holdings co. ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop intel® architecture- and communications-based solutions for smartphones. we have also agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of beijing unispreadtrum technology ltd. (unispreadtrum), a holding company under tsinghua unigroup. during q3 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment. subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, the second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately $500 million. 52
