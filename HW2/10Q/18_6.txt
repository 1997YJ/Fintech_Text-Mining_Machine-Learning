computing group (ccg) and record revenue from both data center group (dcg) and internet of things group (iotg). the revenue results included programmable solutions group (psg) revenue from the newly acquired altera corporation (altera). q3 2016 revenue was above our business outlook, which was revised upward in september 2016 from our original expectations as a result of inventory replenishment and better than expected pc demand. gross margin of 63.3%, including approximately 1.5 points of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, was 3.3 points above the midpoint of our original expectation of 60.0% and was up 0.3 points from q3 2015. compared to q3 2015, the gross margin percentage was positively impacted by lower platform unit costs and higher platform average selling prices, which were partially offset by higher factory startup costs on 10nm, lower non-volatile memory solutions group (nsg) profits, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. spending on r&d and mg&a for the quarter was $5.1 billion, down $77 million from q2 2016, driven by deeper cuts associated with our restructuring program partially offset by an increase in profit dependent spending. there were $372 million in restructuring and other charges for the quarter. operating income for q3 2016 was $4.5 billion, up 6% on a year-on-year basis. the tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%. net income for q3 2016 was $3.4 billion, up 9% on a year-on-year basis. earnings per share were $0.69, up 5 cents on a year-on-year basis. in september 2016, to further accelerate our transformation and focus our business on core strategic areas, we announced the planned divestiture of our intel security business. the planned divestiture along with the 2016 restructuring program, which is on-track to achieve the run rate savings and employment reductions announced earlier this year, resulted in additional restructuring and other charges in q3 2016. for additional information about the restructuring programs as well as the divestiture of intel security, see "restructuring and other charges" in the md&a and "note 8: acquisitions and divestitures" respectively. compared to q3 2015, ccg revenue was up 5% and operating income increased 37%. dcg revenue was up 10% and operating income was down 1% as we increased investments and continued to ramp the first 14nm dcg product. iotg revenue was up 19% and operating income was up 27%. nsg revenue was down 1% and operating loss was at $134 million. psg recognized revenue of $425 million, up 6 percent when compared to altera’s results from a year ago, and operating income was at $78 million. intel security group (isecg) revenue was up 6% and operating income was up 19%.we ended q3 2016 with $17.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets, up $80 million from q2 2016. our business continues to generate healthy cash with $5.8 billion of cash from operations in q3 2016. during q3 2016, we purchased $2.5 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, repurchased $457 million of common stock, and repaid $1.0 billion in commercial paper. as of october 1, 2016, total debt was $27.6 billion. our business outlook for q4 2016 and full-year 2016 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general, and administrative (mg&a)), restructuring, and capital expenditures. we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release. our business outlook

q3 2015. the higher revenue is driven by higher platform average selling prices, up 7% due to a higher mix of dcg platform unit sales and a lower mix of phone and tablet platform unit sales, along with the inclusion of revenue in psg from the newly acquired altera and higher ccg non-platform revenue. these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower platform unit sales, down 2%, which were driven by lower phone, tablet and desktop platform unit sales, which were partially offset by higher notebook platform unit sales.  our overall gross margin percentage was 63.3% in q3 2016, up from 63.0% in q3 2015. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars for q3 2016 and q3 2015 from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments. our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2016 increased by $872 million, or 9.6%, compared to q3 2015. the following results drove the change in gross margin in q3 2016 compared to q3 2015 by approximately the amounts indicated:(in

remaining accruals were recorded as an increase to our pension liability and are not included in our accrued restructuring balance.restructuring actions related to this program that were approved in 2016 impacted approximately 15,000 employees. we estimate that the charges incurred to date as part of the 2016 restructuring program will result in net annual headcount savings of approximately $1.6 billion as we re-balance our workforce. on an annual basis, we expect $1.4 billion of these savings will reduce our r&d and mg&a spending and the remainder will reduce our cost of sales. we began to realize these savings in q2 2016 and expect to fully realize these savings by mid-2017. these savings are in conjunction with our effort to increase investments in our strategically important areas such as the data center, internet of things, and memory businesses.2013 and 2015 restructuring programs. as of october 1, 2016, the remaining liability associated with both programs is $17 million

purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.cash used for investing activities was higher for the first nine months of 2016 compared to first nine months of 2015. the increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of altera and net trading assets activity (which was a use of cash in 2016 compared to a source of cash in 2015). this activity was partially offset by higher maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments (which included $835 million of cash received from asml sales), and lower investments in loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements in the first nine months of 2016.  financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.cash was used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2016 compared to cash provided by financing in the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to $8.0 billion cash from the issuance of senior unsecured notes during the first nine months of 2015 compared to $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2016. this activity was partially offset by net short term debt (primarily commercial paper, which was a source of cash in 2016 compared to a use of cash in 2015), and a decrease in common stock repurchases in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015.liquidityduring 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera in an all-cash transaction. the transaction closed on december 28, 2015, during q1 2016. the transaction had an approximate value of $16.5 billion. we financed a portion of the acquisition by issuing $9.5 billion in long-term debt during 2015 and borrowing $4.0 billion against our short-term credit facility during q1 2016. we funded the remainder of the acquisition with issuances of commercial paper and existing cash and investments. for information on our indebtedness, see "note 14: borrowings."cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of october 1, 2016, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $17.8 billion ($25.3 billion as of december 26, 2015). the decreased balance compared to december 26, 2015 was primarily related to the cash consideration paid for our acquisition of altera, which closed on december 28, 2015. in addition to the $17.8 billion, we have $4.2 billion of other long-term investments, $1.2 billion of loans receivable and other investments, and $250 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority are rated aa-/aa3 or better.55intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $3.0 billion during the first nine months of 2016 and $450 million commercial paper remained outstanding as of october 1, 2016. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of october 1, 2016. on december 21, 2015, we entered into a short-term credit facility to borrow up to $5.0 billion to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of altera. under this credit facility we borrowed $4.0 billion, and the facility was closed in january 2016. in q2 2016, we issued a total of $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness, including our 1.95% senior notes due 2016 and a portion of our 1.35% senior notes due 2017. for further information on the terms of the notes, see “note 14: borrowings” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.as of october 1, 2016, $15.2 billion of our $17.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $15.2 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $1.5 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of october 1, 2016. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of october 1, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $20.1 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $10.5 billion was classified as level 1, $9.5 billion as level 2, and $21 million as level 3.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in active markets. we evaluate instrument-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt instrument is active.of the $9.5 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 35% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 65% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.56intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of october 1, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $603 million of loans receivable and $768 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of october 1, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.0 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.contractual obligationsduring q2 2016, we issued a total of $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness. during q1 2016, we acquired $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes as a result of our altera acquisition. our remaining total cash payments (including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheets) over the life of these long-term debt obligations are expected to be approximately $6.3 billion. for further information, see “note 14: borrowings” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.57
