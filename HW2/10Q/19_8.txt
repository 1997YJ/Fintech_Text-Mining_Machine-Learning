summary and selected consolidated statements of earnings datanet sales increased 9.0% to $22.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $20.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. our total comparable store sales increased 6.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by a 4.0% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 2.5% increase in our comparable store average ticket. comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 7.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we reported net earnings of $1.8 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.44 compared to net earnings of $1.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.21 for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 included a $71 million net benefit to our provision for income taxes due primarily to the favorable settlement of a tax audit, resulting in a benefit of $0.05 to diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2015.key initiativesin the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we continued to focus on the following key initiatives:customer experience – our customer experience initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates, and our commitment to customer service remains strong. we have taken a number of steps to enhance this initiative to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores, online, on the job site or in their homes. we continued to utilize our second generation first phones, our web-enabled handheld devices, to enhance the customer experience in our stores by allowing our associates to convert online sales in the aisle and expedite the checkout process for customers during peak traffic periods. product authority – our product authority initiative is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. we also continued to utilize our merchandising 13table of contentsassortment planning and pricing tools to better understand customer preferences and to refine our product assortment in particular stores and geographic areas. productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain, disciplined capital allocation, and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. we continue to optimize our supply chain through our multi-year program called project sync, which is being rolled out gradually to suppliers in several u.s. rapid deployment centers ("rdcs"). this will allow us to significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf, reduce transportation expenses and improve inventory turns. as we continue to roll out project sync, we plan to create an end-to-end solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain, from our suppliers to our transportation providers to our rdc and store associates to our customers.we opened one new store in mexico during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, for a total store count of 2,275 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016, a total of 298 of our stores, or 13.1%, were located in canada and mexico.we generated $3.6 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. this cash flow, along with $3.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, was used to repay $3.0 billion of 5.40% senior notes that matured on march 1, 2016, fund $1.2 billion of share repurchases, pay $862 million of dividends, repay $350 million of short-term borrowings and fund $325 million in capital expenditures.our inventory turnover ratio was 4.8 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 4.7 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015. our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 29.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 26.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015.interconnecting retail – our focus on interconnecting retail is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we continued to invest in our interconnected abilities to more effectively meet customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. our new customer order management platform ("com") is scheduled to be rolled out in all of our u.s. stores before the end of fiscal 2016. we also continued the roll out of our buy online, deliver from store ("bodfs") program, which complements our existing interconnecting retail programs, buy online, ship to store ("boss") and buy online, pick-up in store ("bopis"). we have seen strong demand for our bodfs program in certain markets where it has been piloted, and expect to complete the roll out of bodfs by the end of fiscal 2016.additionally, we have fully implemented boss via rdc delivery capability, which enables us to fulfill boss orders through our rdc network, leveraging our inventory and fulfillment channels, which has resulted in significant cost savings and improved shipping times and customer satisfaction scores. in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, over 40% of our online orders were picked up in our stores through our bopis and boss offerings. sales from our online channels increased 21.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and represented 5.7% of our total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. 14table of contentswe believe

2016 increased 9.0% to $22.8 billion from $20.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. the increase in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 primarily reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, as well as sales from interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the increase in net sales was partially offset by pressure from a stronger u.s. dollar, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $196 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.total comparable store sales increased 6.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, an improved u.s. home improvement market, favorable weather conditions and broad-based growth across our stores. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. comparable store sales for our appliances, tools, building materials, lumber, lighting, hardware, millwork and décor product categories were above the company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 4.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and our comparable store average ticket increased 2.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, roofing, sheds and windows, offset in part by the strength of the u.s. dollar.gross profit increased 8.5% to $7.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $7.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, decreased 13 basis points to 34.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 34.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. the decrease in gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of interline, which has a lower gross profit margin, partially offset by benefits from our supply chain driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity.selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 2.8% to $4.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $4.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 18.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 19.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls.depreciation and amortization increased 3.3% to $433 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $419 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 2.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.operating income increased 18.5% to $3.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from $2.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. operating income as a percent of net sales was 13.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 12.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015.for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized $237 million of interest and other, net, compared to $193 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 0.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. these results reflect additional interest expense incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due primarily to higher long-term debt balances.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 34.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. the effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 reflects a $71 million net benefit to our provision for income taxes due primarily to the favorable settlement of a tax audit.diluted earnings per share were $1.44 for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $1.21 for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 reflect $0.05 of benefit from the favorable settlement of a tax audit.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the same period in fiscal 2015. this increase was primarily due to a $224 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage.net cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $321 million compared to $317 million for the same period in fiscal 2015. the amount of cash flow used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily capital expenditures, was consistent with the same period last year.16table of contentsnet cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $2.3 billion compared to $2.0 billion for the same period of fiscal 2015. in february 2016, we issued $1.35 billion of 2.00% senior notes due april 1, 2021 (the "2021 notes") at a discount of $5 million, $1.3 billion of 3.00% senior notes due april 1, 2026 (the "2026 notes") at a discount of $8 million, and $350 million of 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2046 (the "2046 notes") at a premium of $2 million (together, the "february 2016 issuance"). the 2046 notes form a single series with our $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2046 that were issued in may 2015, and have the same terms. the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due april 1, 2046 is $1.6 billion. interest on the 2021 and 2026 notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2016. interest on the 2046 notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning april 1, 2016, with interest accruing from october 1, 2015. the net proceeds of the february 2016 issuance were used to repay our 5.40% senior notes that matured on march 1, 2016.in fiscal 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion, accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the february 2016 issuance. in connection with the february 2016 issuance, we paid $89 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. this amount, net of income taxes, is included in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2026 notes.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in december 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. at may 1, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, all of our short-term borrowings were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $617 million. as of may 1, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.as of may 1, 2016, we had $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.recent accounting pronouncementsfor a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements which may be applicable to us, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.on february 1, 2016, we adopted accounting standards update
