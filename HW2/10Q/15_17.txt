performance, operating environment, strategy and outlookour businesswe apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. we strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. every day, we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues are derived from the sale of our products, as well as through alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies (alliance revenues).on february 6, 2013, an initial public offering (ipo) of the class a common stock of our subsidiary, zoetis inc. (zoetis), was completed, pursuant to which we sold 99.015 million shares of class a common stock of zoetis in exchange for the retirement of approximately $2.5 billion of pfizer commercial paper issued in 2013. the shares of class a common stock sold in the ipo represented approximately 19.8% of the total outstanding zoetis shares. on february 1, 2013, zoetis shares began trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol "zts." prior to and in connection with the ipo, zoetis completed a $3.65 billion senior notes offering, and we transferred to zoetis substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our animal health business. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investment: divestitures, and see the “our business development initiatives” and “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” sections of this md&a.on november 30, 2012, we completed the sale of our nutrition business to nestlé for $11.85 billion in cash. the operating results of this business are reported as discontinued operations––net of tax in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three months ended april 1, 2012. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investment: divestitures and see the “our business development initiatives” and “discontinued operations” sections of this md&a.our first quarter 2013 performancerevenues in the first quarter of 2013 were $13.5 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the same period in 2012, which reflects an operational decline of $1.3 billion, or 8%, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $118 million, or 1%. the operational decrease was primarily the result of the loss of exclusivity of lipitor during the second quarter of 2012 in developed europe and geodon in march 2012 in the u.s., and the timing of government purchases of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 in various markets, slightly offset by growth in the emerging markets business unit. lipitor and other product losses of exclusivity negatively impacted revenues by approximately $1.3 billion, or 9%, in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012.48table of contentsthe following table provides the significant impacts on revenues for the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012:  three months ended(millions of dollars) march 31, 2013v.april 1, 2012worldwidechange% changeworldwide% changeu.s.% changeinternational      lipitor(a) $(769)(55)(55)(55)prevnar 13/prevenar 13 (99)(10)(19)2xalatan/xalacom(a) (80)(35)(27)(36)revatio(a) (64)(47)(84)14prevnar/prevenar (7-valent) (57)(41)—(41)detrol/detrol la(a) (44)(23)(16)(33)zosyn/tazocin (41)(32)(44)(20)viagra (35)(7)(9)(5)norvasc (33)(10)(29)(9)aricept(b) (32)(34)—(34)xalkori 36212100*inlyta 56***lyrica 111121112alliance revenues(a) (89)(11)9(56)all other biopharmaceutical products(a), (c) (348)(16)(35)1animal health (zoetis) products 50583consumer healthcare products 8412168(a) lipitor lost exclusivity in the u.s. in november 2011, in the majority of developed european markets in march and may 2012 and in australia in april 2012. xalatan/xalacom lost exclusivity in the majority of european markets in january 2012 and in australia in july 2012. revatio tablet lost exclusivity in the u.s. in september 2012. detrol immediate release (detrol ir) lost exclusivity in the u.s. in june 2012. detrol ir and detrol la lost exclusivity in most european markets in september 2012. adversely impacting alliance revenues were the loss of exclusivity for aricept 5mg and 10mg tablets in the majority of european markets in february 2012 and april 2012 and the return of our rights to aricept in japan to eisai co., ltd. in december 2012; in addition, lower revenues for spiriva in certain european countries, canada and australia reflect final-year terms in 2012 of our collaboration agreements in those markets. geodon, which is included in all other biopharmaceutical products, lost exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2012.(b) represents direct sales under license agreement with eisai co., ltd.(c) includes the “all other” category included in the revenues—major biopharmaceutical products table presented in this md&a, which includes sales of generic atorvastatin, which declined due to multi-source generic competition in the u.s. beginning in late may 2012.* calculation not meaningful.income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2013 was $2.8 billion, compared to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting, among other items:•charges for legal matters that changed favorably by approximately $897 billion (pre-tax) in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 (see also the “costs and expenses––other deductions––net” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 4. other deductions––net); •additional benefits generated from our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives; •charges related to our non-acquisition related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives that were approximately $600 million (pre-tax) lower in the first quarter of 2013 than in the same period in 2012;•a $490 million (pre-tax) gain associated with the transfer of certain product rights to our equity-method investment in china, hisun pfizer pharmaceuticals company limited (hisun pfizer) (see also the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investment: divestitures);•purchase accounting charges that were approximately $214 million (pre-tax) lower in the first quarter of 2013 than in the same period in 2012; and49table of contents•acquisition-related costs that were approximately $88 million (pre-tax) lower in the first quarter of 2013 than in the same period in 2012, partially offset by:•lower revenues, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of lipitor, as well as certain other products (see also "industry-specific challenges" section of this md&a). see also the “discontinued operations” section of this md&a.our operating environmentu.s. healthcare legislationin march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (together, the u.s. healthcare legislation, and also known as the affordable care act), was enacted in the u.s. as explained more fully in our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a, this legislation has resulted in both current and longer-term impacts on us. we recorded the following amounts as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation:•$128 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $123 million in the first quarter of 2012 recorded as a reduction to revenues, related to the higher, extended and expanded rebate provisions and the medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •$55 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $103 million in the first quarter of 2012 recorded in selling, informational and administrative expenses, related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for u.s. income tax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs.industry-specific challengesthe majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we face a number of industry-specific challenges, which can significantly impact our results. these factors include, among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, pipeline productivity and the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition among branded products.as more fully explained in our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a, the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. our 2013 financial guidance reflects the anticipated impact in 2013 of the loss of such rights as described below (see the “our financial guidance for 2013” section of this md&a for additional information).our 2013 results have been and/or will be adversely impacted by the following:•lipitor in the u.s.––we lost exclusivity for lipitor in the u.s. in november 2011. the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s. began in may 2012, with attendant increased competitive pressures.lipitor in international markets––lipitor lost exclusivity in australia in april 2012 and most of developed europe in march 2012 and may 2012, and now faces multi-source generic competition in those markets. lipitor has lost exclusivity in all major markets.•other recent loss of exclusivity impacts––in the u.s., we lost exclusivity for geodon in march 2012 and revatio tablet in september 2012. we lost exclusivity for xalatan and xalacom in the majority of european markets in january 2012 and australia in july 2012. we lost exclusivity for aricept in the majority of european markets in february 2012 and april 2012. caduet lost exclusivity in the majority of european markets in march and may 2012. we lost exclusivity in the u.s. for detrol ir in june 2012. detrol ir and detrol la lost exclusivity in most european markets in september 2012.•aricept—our rights to aricept in japan returned to eisai co., ltd. in december 2012. we expect to lose exclusivity for the aricept 23mg tablet in the u.s. in july 2013.•spiriva—our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim (bi) for spiriva expires on a country-by-country basis between 2012 and 2016, including the expiration in certain eu markets and canada and australia in 2012, which is adversely impacting our 2013 results. we expect to experience a graduated decline in revenues from spiriva through 2016.50table of contents•enbrel—our u.s. and canada collaboration agreement with amgen inc. for enbrel will expire in october 2013. while we are entitled to royalties for 36 months thereafter, we expect that those royalties will be significantly less than our current share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canada sales. outside the u.s. and canada, our exclusive rights to enbrel continue in perpetuity.•rebif—our collaboration agreement with emd serono inc. (serono) to co-promote rebif in the u.s. will expire either at the end of 2013 or the end of 2015, depending on the outcome of pending litigation between pfizer and serono concerning the interpretation of the agreement. we believe that we are entitled to a 24-month extension of the agreement to the end of 2015. serono believes that we are not entitled to the extension and that the agreement will expire at the end of 2013. in october 2011, the philadelphia court of common pleas sustained our preliminary objections and dismissed serono's complaint. in march 2013, the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed that decision. in april 2013, serono filed a petition with the superior court of pennsylvania seeking reconsideration of the decision. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12. commitments and contingencies.for additional information, including with regard to the expiration of the patents and of co-promotion and licensing rights for various products in the u.s., eu and japan in 2013 and subsequent years, see the “patents and intellectual property rights” section of our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a and the “the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights” section of our 2012 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a.we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights whenever we deem appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues––selected revenues from biopharmaceutical products” section of this md&a. see part ii––other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this quarterly report on form 10-q for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation.in august 2011, the federal budget control act of 2011 (the budget control act) was enacted in the u.s. the budget control act includes provisions to raise the u.s. treasury department’s borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling, and provisions to reduce the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion between 2012 and 2021. deficit-reduction targets include $900 billion of discretionary spending reductions associated with the department of health and human services and various agencies charged with national security, but those discretionary spending reductions do not include programs such as medicare and medicaid or direct changes to pharmaceutical pricing, rebates or discounts. the office of management and budget (omb) is responsible for identifying the remaining $1.5 trillion of deficit reductions, which will be divided evenly between defense and non-defense spending. under this omb review process, social security, medicaid, veteran benefits and certain other spending categories are excluded from consideration, but reductions in payments to medicare providers may be made, although any such reductions are prohibited by law from exceeding 2% of the originally budgeted amount. additionally, certain payments to medicare part d plans, such as low-income subsidy payments, are exempt from reduction. while we do not know the specific nature of the spending reductions under the budget control act that will affect medicare, we do not expect that those reductions will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. however, any significant spending reductions affecting medicare, medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit-reduction effort or legislative replacement for the budget control act, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.enforcement of the u.s. federal debt ceiling has been suspended through may 18, 2013. if the u.s. federal government fails to suspend enforcement of the debt ceiling beyond may 18, 2013 or to increase the debt ceiling and, as a result, is unable to satisfy its financial obligations, including under medicare, medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.in march 2013, we received a warning letter from the fda with respect to our manufacturing facility in catania, italy. the letter raises certain issues related to the inspection of that facility that was conducted by the fda in 2012 in connection with our application to transfer to catania the manufacture of tygacil and the packaging of the 40-gram dosage of zosyn, both for the u.s. market. we currently manufacture penicillin and non-penicillin antibiotics, as well as methotrexate and diluent for torisel at catania. we continue to work with the fda to address the issues raised in the warning letter.the global economic environmentin addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment, which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the u.s. and europe, including the countries that use the euro, and in a number of emerging markets. we believe that patients, experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment, including high unemployment levels, and increases in co-pays, sometimes switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments to reduce their costs. challenging economic 51table of contentsconditions in the u.s. also have increased the number of patients in the medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many states, to formulary restrictions limiting access to brand-name drugs, including ours. in addition, we continue to experience pricing pressure in various markets around the world, including in developed european markets, japan and in a number of emerging markets, with government-mandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products and government-imposed access restrictions in certain countries.significant portions of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen, the u.k. pound, the chinese renminbi, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will increase, having a positive impact, and our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact, on net income. likewise, if the u.s. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact, and our overall expenses will decrease, having a positive impact on net income. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.on february 13, 2013, the venezuelan government devalued its currency from a rate of 4.3 to 6.3 of venezuelan currency to the u.s. dollar. we incurred a foreign currency loss of $80 million immediately on the devaluation as a result of remeasuring the local balance sheets, and we will experience ongoing adverse impacts to earnings as our revenues and expenses will be translated into u.s. dollars at lower rates. we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or devaluations of any other currencies. despite the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated investment grade by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial condition, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a; in part ii, item 1a., “risk factors”, of this quarterly report on form 10-q; and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a.our strategywe believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. we continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. we will work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to patients and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues.on november 30, 2012, we completed the sale of our nutrition business to nestlé. on february 6, 2013, an ipo of a 19.8% ownership interest in zoetis was completed. we may in the future make a tax-free distribution to our shareholders of all or a portion of our remaining equity interest in zoetis, which may include one or more distributions effected as a dividend to all pfizer shareholders, one or more distributions in exchange for pfizer shares or other securities, or any combination thereof. we are considering all alternatives to maximize the after-tax return for our shareholders, including a tax-free distribution to our shareholders. if pursued, any disposition would be subject to various conditions, including receipt of any necessary regulatory or other approvals and the existence of satisfactory market conditions. if we decide to fully separate zoetis, then, following such separation, pfizer will be a global biopharmaceutical company with an innovative core and a value core in developed markets, with different cost structures and operating drivers. the innovative core objective is to generate growth, sustained by our r&d investments. the value core objective is to generate strong cash 52table of contentsflow, albeit with less revenue growth. the value core also provides us with the potential to capitalize on our experience in biologic development, manufacturing and commercialization, which provide us with a competitive advantage in the bio-therapeutics marketplace. our emerging markets unit has a geographic focus that includes both the innovative and value cores in those markets. we will continue to assess whether the performance in emerging markets can be optimized by operating with separate innovative and value organizations. the innovative core includes a portfolio of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line products and an research and development organization focused on continuing to build a robust pipeline of highly differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical needs. the value core includes a portfolio of products that have lost exclusivity or are approaching the loss of exclusivity that help meet the global need for less expensive, quality medicines. in addition, we have a complementary consumer healthcare business with several well-known brands.in response to the challenging operating environment, we have taken and continue to take many steps to strengthen our company and better position ourselves for the future. we believe in a comprehensive approach to our challenges—organizing our business to maximize research, development and commercial opportunities, improving the performance of our innovative core, making the right capital allocation decisions, and protecting our intellectual property.we continue to transform our global research and development organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d with the goal/objective of building a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d priorities include: delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and the system's overall productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules—immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines. for additional information, see the “costs and expenses—restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a.while a significant portion of r&d is done internally, we continue to seek to expand our pipeline by entering into agreements with other companies to develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. collaboration, alliance and license agreements and acquisitions allow us to capitalize on these compounds to expand our pipeline of potential future products. in addition, collaborations and alliances allow us to share risk and to access external scientific and technological expertise.for information about our pending new drug applications (nda) and supplemental filings, see the “revenues—product developments—biopharmaceutical” section of this md&a.we continue to build on our broad portfolio of businesses through various business development transactions. see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a for information on our recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe complement our businesses.we continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies), and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. in addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity.we remain focused on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the company. for information regarding our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, see the “costs and expenses—restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a.our strategy also includes directly enhancing shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources—share-purchase plans and dividends on common stock” sections of this md&a for more information.53table of contentsour business development initiativeswe are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate profitable revenue growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. we are especially interested in opportunities in our high-priority therapeutic areas––immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases;  neuroscience and pain; and vaccines––and in emerging markets and established products. we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to

organization.biopharmaceutical revenues worldwide revenues from biopharmaceutical products were $11.5 billion for the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of 12% compared to the first quarter in 2012 primarily due to:•the decrease in operational revenues of approximately $1.1 billion due to the loss of exclusivity of various products in certain markets, including a decrease of $792 million in operational revenues from branded lipitor;•multi-source generic competition in the u.s. for atorvastatin beginning in late may 2012;•lower operational alliance revenues of approximately $160 million, from aricept due to the loss of exclusivity in the majority of european markets and the return of our rights to aricept in japan to eisai co., ltd., and from spiriva due to the 2012 final-year terms of our collaboration agreements in certain european countries, canada and australia, partially offset by an increase of approximately $60 million in operational revenues from enbrel and rebif;•the timing of government purchases of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 in various markets; and•the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $113 million, or 1%,partially offset by:•an increase in operational revenues in developed markets for certain biopharmaceutical products, particularly lyrica, inlyta and xalkori; and•an increase in operational revenues in the emerging markets unit related to various products.56table of contentsgeographically,•in the u.s., revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 13% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily reflecting lower revenues from lipitor, revatio, detrol/detrol la and geodon, all due to loss of exclusivity; and lower revenues from prevnar 13/prevenar 13, zosyn, atorvastatin and viagra. the impact of these adverse factors was partially offset by the strong performance of certain other biopharmaceutical products and lower reductions related to rebates. •in our international markets, revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 11% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of lipitor in most of developed europe and australia, xalatan/xalacom in the majority of european markets and in australia, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2%. operationally, revenues decreased 9% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. in addition to lipitor and xalatan/xalacom, the decrease in operational revenues was driven by detrol/detrol la and aricept, both due to loss of exclusivity in certain markets, as well as lower alliance revenues, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of aricept in many major european markets and the return of our rights to aricept in japan to eisai co., ltd., and lower revenues for spiriva in certain european countries, canada and australia (reflecting the final-year terms in 2012 of our spiriva collaboration agreements relating to those countries), as well as lower revenues for prevnar/prevenar (7-valent). the impact of these adverse factors was partially offset by the operational growth of lyrica, inlyta and xalkori.during the first quarter of 2013, international revenues from biopharmaceutical products represented 61% of total revenues from biopharmaceutical products, compared to 60% in the first quarter of 2012.primary care operating segment•primary care unit revenues decreased 21% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflecting lower operational revenues of 20%, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of lipitor and the resulting shift in the reporting of lipitor revenues in developed europe and australia to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2013, as well as the loss of exclusivity of aricept and the near-term expiration of certain co-promotion agreements for spiriva, partially offset by the strong performance of lyrica in the u.s. and developed europe, and the growth of celebrex and pristiq in the u.s.collectively, the decline in revenues in developed markets for lipitor and for certain other primary care unit products that lost exclusivity in various markets in 2012, as well as the resulting shift in the reporting of certain product revenues to the established products unit, reduced primary care unit revenues by approximately $900 million, or 22%, in comparison with the first quarter of 2012. specialty care and oncology operating segment•specialty care unit revenues decreased 12% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, due to lower operational revenues of 11%, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the decline in operational revenues was primarily due to lower prevnar revenue in the u.s., mainly due to the timing of u.s. government purchases, and the losses of exclusivity and the resulting shift in the reporting of geodon and revatio revenues in the u.s. and xalatan/xalacom revenues in the developed europe and australia to the established product unit beginning january 1, 2013. collectively, these developments reduced specialty care unit revenues by $442 million, or 12%, in comparison with the first quarter of 2012. the decline in operational revenues was partially offset by the growth of enbrel in the u.s.•oncology unit revenues increased 29% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflecting higher operational revenues of 31%, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2%. operational revenues were favorably impacted by the recent launches of new products, most notably inlyta and xalkori in several major markets, partially offset by the decline in sutent revenues in the u.s., eu and japan, due to increased competition in those markets, as well as cost containment measures in the eu and japan and some conversion from sutent to inlyta in japan due to broader label in japan.established products and emerging markets operating segment•established products unit revenues decreased 16% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to lower operational revenues of 15%, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the decrease in established products unit operational revenues in the first quarter of 2013 was primarily due to multi-source generic competition in the u.s. for lipitor beginning in late may 2012, as well as continuing competitive and pricing pressures. the decrease was partially offset by revenues from products in certain markets that were shifted to the established products unit from other business units beginning january 1, 2013.•emerging markets unit revenues increased 5% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, due to higher operational revenues of 6%, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the increase in emerging markets unit operational revenues in the first quarter of 2013 was primarily due to strong volume growth in china, 57table of contentswhich was partially offset by the timing of government purchases of enbrel and the prevenar franchise in certain emerging markets as well as the transfer of certain products rights to our equity-method investment in china.total revenues from established products in both the established products and emerging markets units were $3.4 billion, with $1.0 billion generated in emerging markets in the first quarter of 2013.other product revenuesanimal health operating segment (zoetis)•animal health (zoetis) revenues increased 5% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflecting higher operational revenues of 6%, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. operational revenues from animal health (zoetis) products were favorably impacted by the solid performance in both the livestock and companion animal portfolios. consumer healthcare operating segment•consumer healthcare unit revenues increased 12% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflecting higher operational revenues of 12%. the operational revenue increase was primarily due to the addition of emergen-c from the acquisition of alacer, as well as solid growth of key products, including advil and robitussin, partially due to a severe cold and flu season in the u.s. rebates and chargebacksas is typical in the biopharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions, that generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized and primarily represent rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results generally have been less than 1% of biopharmaceutical net sales and can result in either a net increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.the following table provides information about certain deductions from revenues:  three months ended(millions of dollars) march 31, 2013 april 1,

contract rebates with managed care customers within the u.s., including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance terms and claims under these contracts. outside of the u.s., performance-based contract rebates include rebates to wholesalers/distributors based on achievement of contracted performance for specific products or sales milestones.(c) chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d) sales allowances primarily represent pharmaceutical rebates, discounts and price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside of the u.s.the total rebates and chargebacks for the first quarter of 2013 were lower compared to the same period in 2012, primarily as a result of:•the impact of decreased medicare and medicaid rebates for certain products that have lost exclusivity;•changes in product mix; and•the impact on chargebacks of decreased sales for certain products that have lost exclusivity,58table of contentspartially offset by, among other factors:•an increase in chargebacks for our branded products as a result of increasing competitive pressures, and increasing sales for certain generic products sold by our greenstone unit that are subject to chargebacks; and•an increase in performance rebates in a number of european markets and china as a result of competitive factors and contract arrangements.our accruals for medicaid rebates, medicare rebates, performance-based contract rebates, sales allowances and chargebacks were $3.7 billion as of march 31, 2013, and $3.8 billion as of december 31, 2012, and substantially all are included in other current liabilities in our condensed

neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the management of fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury, and as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures in the u.s. for certain countries outside the u.s., lyrica is indicated for neuropathic pain (peripheral and central), the management of fibromyalgia, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and general anxiety disorder. lyrica recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 12% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. internationally, lyrica revenues increased 12% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, with the growth due to a focus on enhancing the neuropathic pain diagnosis and treatment rates, the successful re-launch of the general anxiety disorder indication in the eu and physician education regarding neuropathic pain in japan. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of 2% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. in the u.s., revenues increased 11% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. notwithstanding these increases, u.s. revenues continue to be affected by increased competition from generic versions of competitive medicines, as well as managed care pricing and formulary pressures.•enbrel, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis affecting the spine, recorded a decrease in worldwide revenues, excluding the u.s. and canada, of 2% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the timing of government purchases of enbrel in certain emerging markets, partially offset by the overall growth in the anti-tumor necrosis factor (tnf) biologic market. under our co-promotion agreement with amgen inc. (amgen), we co-promote enbrel in the u.s. and canada and share in the profits from enbrel sales in those countries, which we include in alliance revenues. our co-promotion agreement with amgen will expire in october 2013, and, subject to the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to a royalty stream for 36 months thereafter, which we expect will be significantly less than our current share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canadian sales. following the end of the royalty period, we will not be entitled to any further revenues from enbrel sales in the u.s. and canada. our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the u.s. and canada will not be affected by the expiration of the co-promotion agreement with amgen.•prevnar 13/prevenar 13 is our 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the prevention of various syndromes of pneumococcal disease in infants and young children and in adults 50 years of age and older. prevnar 13/prevenar 13 for use in infants and young children is marketed in the u.s. for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 13 serotypes in prevnar 13 and otitis media caused by the seven serotypes in prevnar, and in the eu and many other international markets for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by the vaccine serotypes. in 2011, we received approval of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 for use in adults 50 years of age and older in the u.s. for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 13 serotypes in prevnar 13, and in the eu for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the vaccine serotypes. to date, prevenar 13 for use in adults 50 years of age and older has been approved in over 85 countries and launched in over 55 countries. on january 25, 2013, the u.s. fda granted approval for the expansion of prevnar 13 for use in children ages 6 to 17 years for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused by the 13 vaccine serotypes. eu approval for use in children 6 to 17 years of age was received on january 7, 2013. worldwide revenues for prevnar 13/prevenar 13 decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. in the u.s., revenues for prevnar 13 decreased 19% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily as a result of the timing of government purchases.we currently are conducting the community-acquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults (capita) to fulfill requirements in connection with the fda’s approval of the prevnar 13 adult indication under its accelerated approval program. capita is an efficacy trial involving subjects 65 years of age and older that is designed to evaluate whether prevnar 13 is effective in preventing the first episode of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes contained in the vaccine. we estimate that this event-driven trial will be completed in the second half of 2013. at its regular meeting held on february 22, 2012, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) indicated that it will defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older until the results of capita, as well as data on the impact of pediatric use of prevnar 13 on the disease 60table of contentsburden and serotype distribution among adults, are available. the rate of uptake for the use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older has been impacted by acip’s decision to defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in that population. at its regular meeting held on june 20, 2012, acip voted to recommend the use of prevnar 13 for adults 19 years of age and older with immuno-compromising conditions such as hiv infections, cancer, advanced kidney disease and other immuno-compromising conditions. this recommendation is based on the disproportionate burden of invasive pneumococcal disease in this patient population.•celebrex, indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis worldwide and for the management of acute pain in adults in the u.s., japan and certain markets in the eu, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 3% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. strong operational performance in the u.s. was primarily driven by price increases, as well as strong market growth, partially offset by continued volume erosion due to ongoing generic pressures and higher rebates. however, celebrex continued to slow the rate of volume erosion due to strong direct-to-consumer and field force promotion. strong operational performance in international markets was driven by growth in japan in the low back pain indication and in emerging markets in the rheumatology and orthopedic sectors, partially offset by lower developed europe revenues in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. celebrex is supported by continued educational and promotional efforts highlighting its efficacy and safety profile for appropriate patients.▪lipitor is for the treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood. branded lipitor recorded worldwide revenues of $626 million, a decrease of 55%, in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012 due to:▪the impact of loss of exclusivity in japan in june 2011 (with generic competition occurring in november 2011), the u.s. (with generic competition occurring in november 2011 and multi-source generic competition occurring in may 2012), australia in april 2012 and most of developed europe in march 2012 and may 2012; ▪the continuing impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition from generics and branded products worldwide; and▪increased payer pressure worldwide, including the need for flexible rebate policies.geographically,▪in the u.s., branded lipitor revenues were $171 million, a decrease of 55% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012; and▪in our international markets, branded lipitor revenues were $455 million, a decrease of 55% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of $6 million in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012.revenues from sales of generic atorvastatin also declined in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the year-ago quarter. revenues from those sales are included in “all other” in the major biopharmaceutical products table above.see the “our operating environment” section of this md&a for a discussion concerning losses of exclusivity for lipitor in various markets.•viagra is indicated for the treatment for erectile dysfunction. viagra worldwide revenues decreased 7% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. u.s. revenues decreased 9% in the first quarter 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to lower prescription volume and increased chargebacks. international revenues decreased 5% compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to branded and generic competitive pressure in developed europe, developed markets and emerging markets, due to the impact of herbal and generic competition.•zyvox is the world’s best-selling branded agent among those used to treat serious gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus-aureus. zyvox worldwide revenues increased 5% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to growth in developed markets overall and emerging markets.•sutent is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc); gastrointestinal stromal tumors after disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate; and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. sutent worldwide revenues increased 1% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, due to increases in uptake in key emerging markets, most notably china, brazil and poland, which more than offset decreases in developed markets due to increased competition, cost containment measures in the eu and japan, as well as some conversion from sutent to inlyta in japan due to broader label in japan.•norvasc, for treating hypertension, lost exclusivity in the u.s. and other major markets in 2007 and in canada in 2009. norvasc worldwide revenues decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012.61table of contents•our premarin family of products helps women address moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms. it recorded a decrease in worldwide revenues of 7% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. u.s. revenues decreased 7% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily driven by volume declines of premarin/prempro due to generic competition, as well as increased rebates, partially offset by volume growth of premarin vaginal cream and a price increase in january 2013. internationally, revenues were relatively flat compared to the same period in 2012. •genotropin, one of the world’s leading human growth hormones, is used in children for the treatment of short stature with growth hormone deficiency, prader-willi syndrome, turner syndrome, small for gestational age syndrome, idiopathic short

primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of vfend tablets and the launch of generic voriconazole (generic vfend) in february 2011.•chantix/champix is an aid to smoking-cessation treatment in adults 18 years of age and older. chantix/champix worldwide revenues decreased 7% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to negative media exposure across several key markets and macro-economic decline, which decreased patient willingness to pay out of pocket. we are continuing our educational and promotional efforts, which are focused on addressing the significant health consequences of smoking, highlighting the chantix/champix benefit-risk proposition, emphasizing the importance of the physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit smoking and identifying alternative treatment-funding models. •pristiq is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the u.s. and in various other countries. pristiq has also been approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (vms) associated with menopause in thailand, mexico, the philippines and ecuador. pristiq recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 10% in the first quarter

receptor antagonist, is one of the leading branded medicines worldwide for overactive bladder. detrol la is an extended-release formulation taken once a day. detrol/detrol la worldwide revenues decreased 23% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to loss of exclusivity for detrol ir and detrol la in the eu in 2012 and the launch of detrol ir generics in the u.s. in 2012. generic competition for detrol la in the u.s. is expected in the first quarter of 2014.•xalabrands consists of xalatan, a prostaglandin, which is a branded agent used to reduce elevated eye pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and xalacom, a fixed combination prostaglandin (xalatan) and beta blocker (timolol) available outside the u.s. xalatan/xalacom worldwide revenues decreased 35% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. lower revenues were due primarily to the loss of exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2011 and in the majority of european markets in january 2012. •revatio is for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). worldwide revenues decreased 47% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. revenues in the first quarter of 2013 were impacted by the loss of exclusivity for revatio tablet in the u.s. in september 2012. revatio intravenous injection will lose exclusivity in the u.s. in may 2013.•inlyta, for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of a prior systemic treatment, is approved in the u.s.

worldwide revenues of $11 million in the first quarter of 2013. see the “research and development—product developments—biopharmaceutical” section of this md&a for a discussion of the status of the regulatory submission for xeljanz (tofacitinib) in the eu. •alliance revenues worldwide decreased 11% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity for aricept 5mg and 10mg tablets in the u.s. in november 2010 and the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s. in may 2011, as well as the loss of exclusivity in many major european markets in february 2012, and lower revenues for spiriva in certain european countries, canada and australia due to the expiration of our collaboration with bi in those countries, partially offset by the strong performance of enbrel and rebif in the u.s. we expect that the aricept 23mg tablet will have exclusivity in the u.s. until july 2013. see the “the industry-specific challenges” section of this md&a for a discussion regarding the expiration of various contract rights relating to aricept, spiriva, enbrel and rebif. eliquis (apixaban) is being jointly developed and commercialized by pfizer and bristol-myers squibb (bms). in 2012, eliquis (apixaban) was approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in the 27 countries of the eu, plus iceland and norway, canada, japan and the u.s. to date, we have launched eliquis in the u.s., uk, germany, denmark and japan. the two companies share commercialization expenses and profit/losses equally on a global basis. •embeda—the required stability programs are underway, and we are working toward a submission with the fda in 2013.see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies for a discussion of recent developments concerning patent and product litigation relating to certain of the products discussed above.research and developmentresearch and development operationsinnovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable, particularly for human health products. as a result, and also because we are predominately a human health company, the vast majority of our r&d spending is associated with human health products, compounds and activities.the following table provides information by operating segment about our r&d expenses (see also notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 13. segment,

responsible for certain development activities. generally, these responsibilities relate to additional indications for in-line products and in-process research and development (ipr&d) projects that have achieved proof-of-concept. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights.(b) includes the animal health operating segment (zoetis) and the consumer healthcare operating segment.(c) worldwide research and development is generally responsible for human health research projects until proof-of-concept is achieved, and then for transitioning those projects to the appropriate business unit for possible clinical and commercial development. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. this organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects. worldwide research and development is also responsible for all human-health-related regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety event activities. pfizer medical is responsible for quality assurance and regulatory compliance activities, which include conducting clinical trial audits and readiness reviews. the decrease in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 results from cost savings associated with the r&d productivity initiative announced on february 1, 2011 (see the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a).(d) corporate and other includes unallocated costs, primarily facility costs, information technology, share-based compensation, and restructuring-related costs. the decrease in the first quarter of 2013 primarily results from lower charges relating to implementing our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives (see the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a).product developments—biopharmaceutical we continue to invest in r&d to provide potential future sources of revenues through the development of new products, as well as through additional uses for in-line and alliance products. notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for existing products or any of our other products in development.we continue to transform our global research and development organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d with the goal/objective of building a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d priorities include: delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and the system's overall productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules—immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines.our development pipeline, which is updated quarterly, can be found at www.pfizer.com/pipeline. it includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication, phase of development and, for late-stage programs, mechanism of action. the information currently in our development pipeline is accurate as of may

submissions.(a) in may 2012, the fda's peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. in june 2012, the fda issued a “complete response” letter with respect to the tafamidis nda. the fda has requested the completion of a second efficacy study and also has asked for additional information on the data within the current tafamidis nda. we are continuing to work with the fda to define a path forward.(b) in april 2010, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the genotropin mark vii multidose disposable device submission. in august 2010, we submitted our response to address the requests and recommendations included in the fda letter. in april 2011, we received a second “complete response” letter from the fda, requesting additional information. we are working to address the fda's requests for additional information.(c) in june 2010, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the celebrex chronic pain supplemental nda. the supplemental nda remains pending while we await the completion of ongoing studies to determine next steps.(d) in 2005, king pharmaceuticals, inc. (king) entered into an agreement with pain therapeutics, inc. (pt) to develop and commercialize remoxy. in august 2008, the fda accepted the nda for remoxy that had been submitted by king and pt. in december 2008, the fda issued a “complete response” letter. in march 2009, king exercised its right under the agreement with pt to assume sole control and responsibility for the development of remoxy. in december 2010, king resubmitted the nda for remoxy with the fda. in june 2011, we and pt announced that a “complete response” letter was received from the fda with regard to the resubmission of the nda. we have been working to address the issues raised in the letter, which primarily relate to manufacturing. we met with the fda in march 2013 to discuss our plan to address the june 2011 "complete response" letter. we received written guidance from the fda in may regarding required next steps, including additional clinical studies, to address the letter. based on that guidance, we are considering our options with respect to remoxy. if we elect to continue development of remoxy, we would not expect to submit a response to the “complete response” letter before mid-2015.(e) boehringer ingelheim (bi), our alliance partner, holds the ndas for spiriva handihaler and spiriva respimat. in september 2008, bi received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the spiriva respimat submission. the fda is seeking additional data, and we are coordinating with bi, which is working with the fda to provide the additional information. a full response will be submitted to the fda upon the completion of planned and ongoing studies.(f) two “approvable” letters were received by wyeth in april and december 2007 from the fda for viviant (bazedoxifene), for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, that set forth the additional requirements for approval. in may 2008, wyeth received an “approvable” letter from the fda for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. the fda is seeking additional data, and we have been systematically working through these requirements and seeking to address the fda's concerns. in february 2008, the fda advised wyeth that it expects to convene an advisory committee to review the pending ndas for both the treatment and prevention indications after we submit our response to the “approvable” letters. if and when our nda for bazedoxifene-conjugated estrogens is approved by the fda, we will reassess the next steps regarding our ndas for viviant. in april 2009, wyeth received approval in the eu for conbriza (the eu trade name for viviant) for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture. viviant was also approved in japan in july 2010 for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and in south korea in november 2011 for the

integrating and restructuring businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. for example:•in connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and•in connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.all of our businesses and functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development, as well as groups such as information technology, shared services and corporate operations. since the acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009, our cost-reduction initiatives announced on january 26, 2009, but not completed as of december 31, 2009, were incorporated into a comprehensive plan to integrate wyeth’s operations to generate cost savings and to capture synergies across the combined company. in addition, on february 1, 2011, among our ongoing cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we announced a new productivity initiative to accelerate our strategies to improve innovation and productivity in r&d by prioritizing areas that we believe have the greatest scientific and commercial promise, utilizing appropriate risk/return profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time.cost-reduction goalswith respect to the january 26, 2009 announcements, and our acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009, in the aggregate, we achieved our cost-reduction goal by the end of 2011, a year earlier than expected, and are continuing to generate cost reductions.with respect to the r&d productivity initiative announced on february 1, 2011, we met our goal to achieve significant reductions in our annual r&d expenses by the end of 2012. adjusted r&d expenses were $7.3 billion in 2012, and were $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2013, and we expect adjusted r&d expenses to be approximately $6.5 billion to $7.0 billion in 2013. for an understanding of adjusted r&d expenses, see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.in addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our organizations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities.68table of contentstotal coststhrough march 31, 2013, we incurred approximately $15.0 billion (pre-tax) in cost-reduction and acquisition-related costs (excluding transaction costs) in connection with the aforementioned initiatives. this $15.0 billion is a component of the $15.7 billion (pre-tax) in total restructuring charges incurred from the beginning of our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives in 2005 through march 31, 2013. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives for more information. in 2013, we expect to incur approximately $500-$800 million (after tax) in costs in connection with our ongoing cost-reduction/productivity initiatives and have reflected those costs, as well as the related expected cost reductions of approximately $1.0 billion (pre-tax), in our 2013 financial guidance. see also the “our financial guidance for 2013” section of this md&a. key activitiesthe targeted cost reductions were achieved through the following actions, and we continue to generate cost reductions through similar actions:•the closing of duplicative facilities and other site rationalization actions company-wide, including research and development facilities, manufacturing plants, sales offices and other corporate facilities. among the more significant actions are the following:◦manufacturing: after the acquisition of wyeth, our manufacturing sites totaled 75. other acquisitions have added 21 manufacturing sites, and we have subsequently exited 15 sites, resulting in 81 sites supporting continuing operations as of march 31, 2013. our plant network strategy will result in the exit of a further six sites over the next several years. these site counts exclude five nutrition business-related manufacturing sites as the nutrition business was sold in 2012. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2b. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investment: divestitures for more information.◦research and development: after the acquisition of wyeth, we operated in 20 r&d sites and announced that we would close a number of sites. we have completed a number of site closures, including our sandwich, u.k. research and development facility, except for a small presence. in addition, in 2011, we rationalized several other sites to reduce and optimize the overall r&d footprint. we disposed of our toxicology site in catania, italy; exited our r&d sites in aberdeen and gosport, u.k.; and disposed of a vacant site in st. louis, mo. we still maintain laboratories in st. louis, mo, that focus on the areas of biologics and indications discovery. we are presently marketing for sale, lease or sale/lease-back, either a portion of or all of certain of our r&d campuses. locations with r&d operations are in the u.s., europe, canada and china, with five major research sites in addition to a number of specialized units. we also re-prioritized our commitments to disease areas and have discontinued certain therapeutic areas and r&d programs as part of our r&d productivity initiative. our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small and large molecules—immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines.•workforce reductions across all areas of our business and other organizational changes, primarily in the u.s. field force, manufacturing, r&d and corporate functions. we identified areas for a reduction in workforce across all of our businesses. in january 2009, when pfizer and wyeth entered into the merger agreement, the workforce of the two companies totaled approximately 130,000. we exceeded our original target to reduce the combined pfizer/wyeth workforce by 15%, or 19,500, within three years. by the end of 2012, we achieved a reduction of 38,500, and by the end of the first quarter of 2013, we achieved a reduction of 40,600. in the first quarter of 2013, the workforce declined by 2,100, from 91,500 to 89,400, primarily in primary care and emerging markets. the aforementioned workforce reductions include the impact of acquisitions and divestitures subsequent to the wyeth acquisition. •the increased use of shared services and centers of excellence.•procurement savings.69table of

quarter of 2012. the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2013 was unfavorably impacted by the non-deductibility of the goodwill derecognized and the jurisdictional mix of the other intangible assets divested as part of the transfer of certain product rights to our equity-method investment in china, largely offset by the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, as well as the extension of the u.s. r&d tax credit, which was signed into law in january 2013, resulting in the full-year benefit of the 2012 r&d tax credit and a portion of the 2013 r&d tax credit being recorded in the first quarter of 2013. for additional information about the transfer of certain product rights, see note 2d. acquisitions, divestitures, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investment: equity-method investment.change in tax lawon february 28, 2013, the governor of puerto rico signed into law act no. 2-2013, amending sections 2101 and 2102 of the puerto rico internal revenue code of 1994, which provided for an excise tax that was effective beginning in 2011 (act 154). the excise tax is imposed on the purchase of products by multinational corporations and their affiliates from their puerto rico affiliates. as originally adopted, the excise tax was to be in effect from 2011 through 2016 and the tax rate was to decline over time from 4% in 2011 to 1% in 2016. act no. 2-2013 extends the excise tax through 2017 and, effective july 1, 2013, increases the tax rate to 4% for all years through 2017. the impact of act no. 2-2013 will be recorded in cost of sales and provision for taxes on income. 71table of contentsdiscontinued operationsfor additional information about our discontinued

incomegeneral description of adjusted income measureadjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines for humans and animals, consumer healthcare (over-the-counter) products, and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income. the adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted income measure is utilized:•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income basis;•our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis; and •senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted income measure. adjusted income is one of the performance metrics utilized in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are funded from a pool based on the achievement of three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from adjusted income. this metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool made available to elt members and other members of senior management and will constitute a factor in determining each of these individual’s bonus.despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, the earn-out of performance share award grants is determined based on a formula that measures our performance using relative total shareholder return.72table of contentspurchase accounting adjustmentsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with pharmacia (acquired in 2003), wyeth (acquired in 2009) and king (acquired in 2011), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research and development costs previously have been expensed.however, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.acquisition-related costsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory authorities.discontinued operationsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the sale of such operations such as the sale of our nutrition business, which we sold in november 2012. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. (restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation of the restated periods, but are presented here on a restated basis for consistency across all periods.)73table of contentscertain significant itemsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transition service agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.reconciliationthe following table provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to pfizer

the same period of 2012. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to:•the loss of exclusivity of lipitor and other products, resulting in lower revenues and associated expenses (see also the “industry-specific challenges” section of this md&a), partially offset by spending reductions resulting from our company-wide cost-reduction/productivity initiatives; and•the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.in the first quarter of 2013 and 2012, the line item called other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, reflects changes in the ordinary course of business for accounts receivable, inventory, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other current and non-current liabilities. for additional information about accounts receivable, see also “selected measures of liquidity and capital resources: accounts receivable” below.investing activitiesour net cash used in investing activities was $10.9 billion in the first quarter of 2013, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $451 million in the same period in 2012. the change in net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was primarily attributable to:•net purchases of investments of $10.8 billion in the first quarter of 2013, compared to net proceeds from redemptions and sales of

$4.6 billion in the first quarter of 2013, compared to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2012; and•higher cash dividends paid.analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources we rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. we believe that we have the ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we further believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:•the working capital requirements of our operations, including our research and development activities;•investments in our business;•dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•share repurchases;•the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•paying down outstanding debt;•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•business-development activities.our long-term debt is rated investment grade by both standard & poor’s (s&p) and moody’s investors service (moody's). see the “credit ratings” section below. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities.selected measures of liquidity and capital resourcesthe following table provides

“analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets” and “analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows” sections of this md&a.zoetis debt offering and initial public offering (ipo)on january 28, 2013, our then wholly owned subsidiary, zoetis, issued $3.65 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, net of an original issue debt discount of $10 million. the notes have a weighted-average effective interest rate of 3.30%, and mature at various dates as follows: 1.15% notes due 2016 ($400 million); 1.875% notes due 2018 ($749 million); 3.25% notes due 2023 ($1.349 billion); and 4.7% notes due 2043 ($1.142 billion). on february 6, 2013, zoetis also entered into a commercial paper program with a capacity of up to $1.0 billion; no amounts are currently outstanding under that program.also, on january 28, 2013, we transferred to zoetis substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our animal health business in exchange for all of the class a and class b common stock of zoetis, $1.0 billion of the $3.65 billion of zoetis senior notes, and an amount of cash equal to substantially all of the cash proceeds received by zoetis from the remaining $2.65 billion of senior notes issued. the $1.0 billion of zoetis senior notes received by pfizer were exchanged by pfizer for the retirement of pfizer commercial paper issued in 2012, and the cash proceeds received by pfizer of approximately $2.5 billion were restricted to use for debt repayment, dividends and/or stock buybacks.on february 6, 2013, an ipo of the class a common stock of zoetis was completed, pursuant to which we sold 99.015 million shares of class a common stock of zoetis in exchange for the retirement of approximately $2.5 billion of pfizer commercial paper issued in 2013. in summary, as a result of the above transactions, we received approximately $6.1 billion of cash (of which approximately $2.5 billion was restricted to use for debt repayment, dividends and/or stock buybacks), and incurred approximately $3.65 billion in zoetis long-term debt. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 7d. financial instruments: long-term debt.domestic and international short-term funds many of our operations are conducted outside the u.s., and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. we generally hold approximately 10% to 30% of these short-term funds in u.s. tax jurisdictions. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s. federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided.accounts receivablewe continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. historically, payments from a number of these european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale and the year-over-year trend is worsening.we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on an analysis of the following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistency of payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).as of march 31, 2013, we had about $1.3 billion in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in italy, greece, portugal, spain and ireland, where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $285 million, were as follows: $116 million in greece; $112 million in italy; $28 million in portugal; $28 million in spain; and $1 million in ireland.80table of contentsalthough certain european governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to appropriately balance repayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.we will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1c. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions included in our 2012 financial report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to our annual report on form 10-k/a for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012.credit ratingstwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s and s&p, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.the following

revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of march 31, 2013, we had access to $8.8 billion of lines of credit, of which $1.8 billion expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.3 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of the unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2016, may be used to support commercial paper borrowings.zoetis––in december 2012, our subsidiary, zoetis, entered into a revolving credit agreement providing for a five-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which became effective in february 2013 and expires in december 2017. subject to certain conditions, zoetis has the right to increase the credit facility up to $1.5 billion. in addition, on february 6, 2013, zoetis entered into a commercial paper program with a capacity of up to $1.0 billion. while no commercial paper has been issued under that commercial paper program, zoetis may incur indebtedness under that program in the future. 81table of contentsglobal economic conditionsthe challenging economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future.off-balance sheet arrangementsin the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of march 31, 2013, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.share-purchase planson december 12, 2011, we announced that the board of directors had authorized a $10 billion share-purchase plan. on november 1, 2012, we announced that the board of directors had authorized an additional $10 billion share-purchase plan, which became effective on november 30, 2012.in the first quarter of 2013, we purchased approximately 170 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.6 billion under our publicly announced share-purchase plans. in the first quarter of 2012, we purchased approximately 77 million shares of our common stock for approximately $1.7 billion under our publicly announced share-purchase plans. after giving effect to share purchases through march 31, 2013, our remaining share-repurchase authorization was approximately $7.2 billion.dividends on common stockin april 2013, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.24 per share, payable june 4, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on may 10, 2013.new accounting standardsrecently adopted accounting standardssee notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 1b. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: adoption of new accounting standards.recently issued accounting standards, not adopted as of march 31, 2013 in march 2013, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for cumulative translation adjustment (cta) upon derecognition of assets or investment within a foreign entity. this new standard provides additional cta accounting guidance on sales or transfers of foreign entity investments and assets as well as step acquisitions involving a foreign entity. the provisions of the new standard are effective january 1, 2014, but we do not expect the provisions of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.    in february 2013, the fasb issued an accounting standards update regarding the measurement of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that may include debt agreements, other contractual obligations and settled litigation or judicial rulings. the provisions of this standard require that these obligations are measured at the amount representing the 82table of contentsagreed upon obligation of the company as well as additional liability amounts it expects to assume on behalf of other parties in the arrangement. the provisions of the new standard are effective january 1, 2014, but we do not expect the provisions of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.forward-looking information and factors that may affect future resultsthis report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” "aim" and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, our anticipated future operating or financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic reviews, capital allocation, business-development plans and plans related to share repurchases and dividends. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans relating to share repurchases and dividends, government regulation and financial results, including, in particular, the financial guidance set forth in the “our financial guidance for 2013” section of this md&a, the anticipated costs and cost savings set forth in the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a and the contributions that we expect to make from our general assets to the company's pension and postretirement plans during 2013 as described in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 10. pension and postretirement benefit plans. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:•the outcome of research and development activities including, without limitation, the ability to meet anticipated clinical trial commencement and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for product candidates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data;• decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve our drug applications, as well as their decisions regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of our products;• the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing

increased or new concerns about the safety or efficacy of, a product that could affect its availability or commercial potential;• the success of external business-development activities;• competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates;• the implementation by the fda of an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products to competition from biosimilar products in the u.s., with attendant competitive pressures, after the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period and patent rights;• the ability to meet generic and branded competition after the loss of patent protection for our products or competitor products;• the ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally;• difficulties or delays in manufacturing;•trade buying patterns; •the impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product exclusivity; •trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment; •the impact of the u.s. budget control act of 2011 (the budget control act) and the deficit-reduction actions to be taken pursuant to the budget control act in order to achieve the deficit-reduction targets provided for therein, and the impact of any broader deficit-reduction efforts; 83table of contents•the possible failure of the u.s. federal government to suspend enforcement of the federal debt ceiling beyond may 18, 2013 or to increase the federal debt ceiling and any resulting inability of the u.s. federal government to satisfy its financial obligations, including under medicare, medicaid and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs; •the impact of u.s. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010—the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act––and of any modification or repeal of any of the provisions thereof; •u.s. legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including under medicaid, medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs; the importation of prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries; direct-to-consumer advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals; and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines; •legislation or regulatory action in markets outside the u.s. affecting pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including, in particular, continued government-mandated price reductions for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european and emerging market countries; •the exposure of our operations outside the u.s. to

intellectual property, both domestically and internationally; •interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates; •governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations, including, without limitation, tax obligations and changes affecting the tax treatment

of contentswe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports and our other filings with the sec.our 2012 annual report on form 10-k/a listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results. we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that form 10-k/a in this filing and investors should refer to it. reference is also made to part ii, item 1a, “risk factors,” of this quarterly report on form 10-q. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. this report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body of data. in addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.legal proceedings and contingencies information with respect to legal proceedings and contingencies
