rate 18.4% 16.0% 2.4 % 18.4% 25.5% (7.1)%our q1 2016 net revenue of $13.7 billion, was up 7% from q1 2015 and in the low end of the range of our business outlook provided in january 2016. the q1 2016 results reflected an extra workweek and results from the newly created programmable solutions group (psg), formerly altera corporation (altera). we saw strong growth in data center group (dcg), internet of things group (iotg), and psg, which was partially offset by challenging macro-economic conditions and a weaker pc market.gross margin of 59.3% for q1 2016 includes approximately 2.5 pts of altera and other non-cash acquisition-related adjustments and is 1.3 pts above the midpoint of our previous business outlook of 58.0%. compared to q1 2015, operating income of $2.6 billion was down 2%, net income of $2.0 billion was up 3%, effective tax rate of 18.4% was down 7.1 pts, and earnings per share of $0.42 was up one cent. compared to q1 2015, client computing group (ccg) revenue was up 2% and operating income increased 34%. dcg revenue was up 9% and operating income was up 4%. iotg achieved revenue was up 22% and operating income was up 41%. psg recognized $359 million in revenue, which does not include $99 million of revenue as a result of acquisition-related adjustments. the non-volatile memory solutions group (nsg) revenue was down 6%. the first quarter results represent our ongoing transformation from a pc company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected computing devices. as intel's business model evolves and we execute to our strategy, the data center and internet of things businesses are the primary growth engines, which combined with our memory and field-programmable gate arrays (fpgas) businesses form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth. our business continues to generate significant cash with $4.1 billion of cash from operations in q1 2016. during q1 2016, we purchased $1.3 billion in capital assets and returned cash to stockholders by paying $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing $800 million of common stock through our stock repurchase program. additionally, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in march 2016 of $0.26 per share of common stock to be paid in june 2016. we ended q1 2016 with $15.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets, which represented a $10.2 billion decrease compared to q4 2015, primarily driven by the acquisition of altera. total debt is $25.4 billion, consistent with our prior commentary on the financing plan for the acquisition of altera. we are building on our strong position in client computing and are investing for growth in the data center, internet of things market segments, and disruptive differentiated memory technology. in order to accelerate the execution, in q2 we announced the 2016 restructuring program. under this program we intend to close certain facilities and reduce up to twelve thousand positions globally. accordingly, we expect to incur charges of approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2016. the actions associated with the program are expected to be fully completed by the second quarter of 2017 and result in annual savings of approximately $1.4 billion once it is fully implemented.our business outlook for q2 2016 and full-year 2016 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general, and administrative (mg&a), restructuring, and capital expenditures. we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release. our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations web site

by $921 million, or 7%, compared to q1 2015. our q1 2016 results reflected an extra workweek as compared to q1 2015. the higher revenue is driven by higher platform average selling prices, up 17% due to a lower mix of phone and tablet platform units sales and a higher mix of dcg platform unit sales, and inclusion of operating results from the newly created psg. these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower platform unit sales of 11%, which were driven by lower phone and tablet platform unit sales. our overall gross margin percentage was 59.3% in q1 2016, down from 60.5% in q1 2015. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by altera and other acquisition-related charges, higher platform unit costs, lower platform unit sales, and nsg ramp. the decrease in gross margin percentage was partially offset by higher platform average selling prices. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2016 and q1 2015 from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments. our overall gross margin dollars in q1 2016 increased by $400 million, or 5.2%, compared to q1 2015. the following results drove the change in gross margin in q1 2016

investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.cash used for investing activities was higher for q1 2016 compared to q1 2015. the cash used for investing activities increase was primarily due to the acquisition of altera and net trading assets activity (which was a use of cash in q1 2016 compared to a source of cash in q1 2015). these decreases were partially offset by a higher collections of loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements and a net increase in available-for-sale activity.  43intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.cash used for financing activities was lower in q1 2016 compared to q1 2015, primarily due to the issuance of commercial paper during q1 2016liquidityduring 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera in an all-cash transaction. the transaction closed on december 28, 2015, during q1 2016. the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion. we financed a portion of the acquisition by issuing $9.5 billion in long-term debt during 2015 and borrowing $4.0 billion against our short-term credit facility during q1 2016. we funded the remainder of the acquisition with issuances of commercial paper and existing cash and investments. for information on our indebtedness, see "note 14: borrowings."cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of april 2, 2016, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $15.1 billion ($25.3 billion as of december 26, 2015). the decreased balance compared to december 26, 2015 was primarily related to the cash consideration paid for our acquisition of altera, which closed on december 28, 2015. in addition to the $15.1 billion, we have $3.1 billion of other long-term investments, $1.5 billion of loans receivable and other investments, and $350 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $3.0 billion during q1 2016 and $921 million commercial paper remained outstanding as of april 2, 2016. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of april 2, 2016. on december 21, 2015, we entered into a short-term credit facility to borrow up to $5.0 billion to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of altera. under this credit facility we borrowed $4.0 billion, and the facility was closed in january 2016.as of april 2, 2016, $14.0 billion of our $15.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $14.0 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $953 million was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of april 2, 2016. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.44intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)marketable debt instrumentsas of april 2, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $16.9 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $7.0 billion was classified as level 1, $9.9 billion as level 2, and $50 million as level 3.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in active markets. we evaluate instrument-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt instrument is active.of the $9.9 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 40% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 60% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of april 2, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $723 million of loans receivable and $418 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of april 2, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.4 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.contractual obligationsduring q1 2016, we acquired $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes as a result of our altera acquisition. our total cash payments (including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheets) over the life of this long-term debt obligation are expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. for further information, see “note 14: borrowings” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.45
