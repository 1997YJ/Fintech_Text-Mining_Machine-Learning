operating segments. google is our only reportable segment. none of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed below as other bets.our reported segments are described below:•google – google includes our main internet products such as search, ads, commerce, maps, youtube, google cloud, android, chrome, and google play as well as our hardware initiatives. our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in google. google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, and digital content; services fees for cloud offerings; and sales of hardware products. •other bets – other bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. other bets includes businesses such as access, calico, capitalg, gv, nest, verily, waymo, and x. revenues from the other bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and tv services through google fiber, sales of nest products and services, and licensing and r&d services through verily. see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for further information. prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current

advertising revenue performance, we present information regarding the percentage change in the number of "paid clicks" and "cost-per-click" for our google properties and google network members' properties. management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. paid clicks for our google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including gmail, maps, and google play; and viewed youtube engagement ads like trueview (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad). paid clicks for our google network members' properties include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on google network members' properties participating in adsense for search, adsense for content, and admob. in some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we primarily charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our revenue base. cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.31table of contentsalphabet inc.in the first quarter of 2017, we refined our methodology for paid clicks and cost-per-click to include additional categories of trueview engagement ads and exclude non-engagement based trial ad formats. this change resulted in a modest increase in paid clicks and a modest decrease in cost-per-click. for comparison purposes, we have included updated data for historical periods in the table below: three months ended mar 31, 2016 jun 30, 2016 sep 30, 2016 dec 31, 2016year-over-year

change in advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google properties and google network members' properties and the correlation between these items, have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:•growth rates of revenues from google properties, including youtube, compared to growth rates of revenues from google network members' properties;•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•seasonality;•the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•changes in device mix;•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;•a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenues generated on google properties and google network members' properties, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and•general economic conditions.our advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.32table of

on:•google search properties which includes revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.;•other google owned and operated properties like gmail, google maps, and google play; and•youtube, including but not limited to, youtube trueview and google preferred.our google properties revenues increased $3,025 million from the three months ended june 30, 2016 to the three months ended june 30, 2017 and increased $6,100 million from the six months ended june 30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017. the growth from the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. we also experienced growth in youtube revenues driven primarily by video advertising. the growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on google properties increased from the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 due to growth in youtube engagement ads, increases in mobile search queries, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base. the positive impact on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers from the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2017. the decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. the decrease in cost-per-click was also impacted by changes in device mix, property mix, product mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.google network members' propertiesthe following table presents our

30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017. the growth from the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 was primarily driven by strength in both programmatic advertising buying and admob, offset by a decline in our traditional adsense businesses and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. the increase in paid clicks from the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 resulted primarily from the growth in admob. paid clicks for our traditional adsense for search business declined from the six months ended june 30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017; however, we experienced a slight increase in paid clicks from the three months ended june 30, 2016 to the three months ended june 30, 2017. the positive impact on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our

constant currency revenue growththe impact of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we use non-gaap constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to gaap results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging impacts realized in the current period.constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.35table of contentsalphabet inc.the following table presents the foreign exchange impact on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, unaudited): three months

acquisition costs (tac) which are paid to google network members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:•the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor including sbc, energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs); •content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);•credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; •inventory related costs for hardware we sell; and•amortization of certain intangible assets. the following tables present our costs of revenues, including traffic acquisition costs (in millions,

higher than the costs of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network members’ properties are paid as tac to our google network members.37table of contentsalphabet inc.cost of revenues increased $2,243 million from the three months ended june 30, 2016 to the three months ended june 30, 2017 and increased $4,390 million from the six months ended june 30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017 due to various factors, including (1) traffic acquisition costs, (2) data center costs which include depreciation, labor (including sbc), energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs, (3) content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube, and (4) hardware related costs.the increases in tac to distribution partners and the associated google properties tac rate were largely driven by a shift to mobile, which carries higher tac, and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to tac. the increases in tac to google network members and the associated network members tac rate were primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher tac. the increase in the aggregate tac rate was also partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from google network member properties to google properties.we expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the remainder of 2017 and in future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:•the relative revenue growth rates of google properties and our google network members’ properties;•traffic acquisition costs paid to our distribution partners, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•traffic acquisition costs paid to google network members, which are affected by ongoing adoption of programmatic advertising buying and changes in partner agreement terms;•the growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory and related costs; and•increased proportion of non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues.research and developmentthe following table presents our r&d expenses (in millions, unaudited): three months ended six months ended june 30, june

organizations;•depreciation and equipment-related expenses;•professional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services; and•amortization of certain intangible assets.general and administrative expenses increased $76 million from the three months ended june 30, 2016 to the three months ended june 30, 2017. the increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $88 million, largely resulting from a 14% increase in headcount and the shift in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle.  this increase was offset by a decrease in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses.general and administrative expenses increased $364 million from the six months ended june 30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017. the increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $243 million, largely resulting from a 15% increase in headcount and the shift in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle. in addition, there was an increase in professional service fees of $158 million primarily due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services, as well as lower legal-related costs in the first quarter of 2016. these increases were offset by a decrease in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses.39table of

commission fineon june 27, 2017, the ec announced its decision that certain actions taken by google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed european competition law. the ec decision imposes a €2.42 billion (approximately $2.74 billion) fine and directs the termination of the conduct at issue. we accrued the fine in the second quarter of 2017, resulting in a

income (expense), net, increased $558 million from the six months ended june 30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017. this increase was primarily driven by reduced costs of our foreign currency hedging activities, and decreased losses on marketable and non-marketable investments.the costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income (expense), net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of foreign exchange rates relative to the contract prices, the volatility of foreign exchange rates, and forward points. the hedging costs expensed in other income (expense), net, decreased as a result of less option premiums paid after we began to use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our forecasted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016.we expect that other income (expense), net, will fluctuate in dollar amount for the remainder of 2017 and future periods as it is largely driven by market dynamics.provision for income taxesthe following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions, unaudited) and effective tax rate: three months ended six

billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the u.s. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the u.s., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. from time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.as of june 30, 2017, $57.9 billion of the $94.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations.our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. we had no commercial paper outstanding as of june 30, 2017. we have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in february 2021. the interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. as of june 30, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. as of june 30, 2017, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $3.9 billion and a total estimated fair value of $4.0 billion.in october 2016, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its class c capital stock. in the six months ended june 30, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired 3.1 million shares of alphabet class c capital stock for an aggregate amount of $2.7 billion. in january 2017, temasek, a singapore-based investment company, signed a binding commitment to purchase a non-controlling interest in verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. the first tranche of the investment closed and we received $480 million in the first quarter of 2017. the final tranche closed and we received the remaining $320 million in july 2017. at december 31, 2016, we had a $1.4 billion interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note (note receivable) due october 2017. the note receivable was fully repaid as of june 30, 2017.for the six months ended june 30, 2016 and 2017, our cash flows were as follows (in millions, unaudited): six

include compensation and related costs, hardware costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.net cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended june 30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017 primarily due to increases in cash received from advertising revenues and google other revenues (net of payouts to developers) offset by increases in cash

in financing activities decreased from the six months ended june 30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017 primarily driven by decreases in the repayment of debt, decreases in repurchases of capital stock, and increases in proceeds from the sale of subsidiary shares. these items were offset by decreases in proceeds received from the issuance of debt and increases in net payments related to stock-based award activities.contractual obligationswe had long-term taxes payable of $4.1 billion as of june 30, 2017 primarily related to uncertain tax positions. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.critical accounting policies and estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. in some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. in some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.revenuesfor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. in this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.see note 1 of part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for the summary of significant accounting policies. in addition, see part i, item 7, "critical

segment. none of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed below as other bets.our reported segments are described below:•google – google includes our main internet products such as search, ads, commerce, maps, youtube, google cloud, android, chrome, and google play as well as our hardware initiatives. our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in google. google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, and digital content; services fees for cloud offerings; and sales of hardware products. •other bets – other bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. other bets includes businesses such as access, calico, capitalg, gv, nest, verily, waymo, and x. revenues from the other bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and tv services through google fiber, sales of nest products and services, and licensing and r&d services through verily. see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part i,

we present information regarding the percentage change in the number of "paid clicks" and "cost-per-click" for our google properties and google network members' properties. management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. paid clicks for our google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including gmail, maps, and google play; and viewed youtube engagement ads like trueview (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad). paid clicks for our google network members' properties include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on google network members' properties participating in adsense for search, adsense for content, and admob. in some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we primarily charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our revenue base. cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.31table of contentsalphabet inc.in the first quarter of 2017, we refined our methodology for paid clicks and cost-per-click to include additional categories of trueview engagement ads and exclude non-engagement based trial ad formats. this change resulted in a modest increase in paid clicks and a modest decrease in cost-per-click. for comparison purposes, we have included updated data for historical periods in the table below: three months ended mar 31, 2016 jun 30, 2016 sep 30, 2016 dec 31, 2016year-over-year change       aggregate paid

change in advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google properties and google network members' properties and the correlation between these items, have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:•growth rates of revenues from google properties, including youtube, compared to growth rates of revenues from google network members' properties;•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•seasonality;•the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•changes in device mix;•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;•a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenues generated on google properties and google network members' properties, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and•general economic conditions.our advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.32table of

the growth from the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. we also experienced growth in youtube revenues driven primarily by video advertising. the growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on google properties increased from the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 due to growth in youtube engagement ads, increases in mobile search queries, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base. the positive impact on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers from the three and six months ended june 30, 2016 to the three and six months ended june 30, 2017. the decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. the decrease in cost-per-click was also impacted by changes in device mix, property mix, product mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.google network members' propertiesthe following table presents our

constant currency revenue growththe impact of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we use non-gaap constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to gaap results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging impacts realized in the current period.constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.35table of contentsalphabet inc.the following table presents the foreign exchange impact on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, unaudited): three months

acquisition costs (tac) which are paid to google network members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:•the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor including sbc, energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs); •content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);•credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions;

higher than the costs of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network members’ properties are paid as tac to our google network members.37table of contentsalphabet inc.cost of revenues increased $2,243 million from the three months ended june 30, 2016 to the three months ended june 30, 2017 and increased $4,390 million from the six months ended june 30, 2016 to the six months ended june 30, 2017 due to various factors, including (1) traffic acquisition costs, (2) data center costs which include depreciation, labor (including sbc), energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs, (3) content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube, and (4) hardware related costs.the increases in tac to distribution partners and the associated google properties tac rate were largely driven by a shift to mobile, which carries higher tac, and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to tac. the increases in tac to google network members and the associated network members tac rate were primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher tac. the increase in the aggregate tac rate was also partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from google network member properties to google properties.we expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the remainder of 2017 and in future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:•the relative revenue growth rates of google properties and our google network members’ properties;•traffic acquisition costs paid to our distribution partners, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•traffic acquisition costs paid to google network members, which are affected by ongoing adoption of programmatic advertising buying and changes in partner agreement terms;•the growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory and related costs; and•increased proportion of non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues.research and developmentthe following table presents our r&d expenses (in millions, unaudited): three months ended six months ended june 30, june

function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of foreign exchange rates relative to the contract prices, the volatility of foreign exchange rates, and forward points. the hedging costs expensed in other income (expense), net, decreased as a result of less option premiums paid after we began to use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our forecasted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016.we expect that other income (expense), net, will fluctuate in dollar amount for the remainder of 2017 and future periods as it

billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the u.s. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the u.s., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. from time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.as of june 30, 2017, $57.9 billion of the $94.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations.our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. we had no commercial paper outstanding as of june 30, 2017. we have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in february 2021. the interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. as of june 30, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. as of june 30, 2017, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $3.9 billion and a total estimated fair value of $4.0 billion.in

to stock-based award activities.contractual obligationswe had long-term taxes payable of $4.1 billion as of june 30, 2017 primarily related to uncertain tax positions. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.critical accounting policies and estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. in some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. in some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.revenuesfor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. in this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.see note 1 of part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for the summary of significant accounting policies. in addition, see part i, item 7, "critical
