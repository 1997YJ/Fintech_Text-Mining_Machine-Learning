therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us (alliance revenues).we manage our commercial operations through two distinct business segments: pfizer innovative health (ih) and pfizer essential health (eh). for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 13a. segment, geographic and other revenue information: segment information and the “our strategy––commercial operations” section of this md&a below.the majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in our 2016 form 10-k, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and highly regulated. as a result, we face a number of industry-specific factors and challenges, which can significantly impact our results. these factors include, among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, the ability to replenish innovative biopharmaceutical products, healthcare legislation, pipeline productivity, the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition. we also face challenges as a result of the global economic environment. for additional information about these factors and challenges, see the “our operating environment” and “the global economic environment” sections of this md&a and of our 2016 financial report and part i, item 1a, “risk factors” of our 2016 form 10-k.the financial information included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for our subsidiaries operating outside the u.s. is as of and for the three and six months ended may 28, 2017 and may 29, 2016. the financial information included in our condensed consolidated financial statements for u.s. subsidiaries is as of and for the three and six months ended july 2, 2017 and july 3, 2016.references to developed and emerging markets in this md&a include:developed markets u.s., western europe, japan, canada, australia, south korea, scandinavian countries, finland and new zealand   emerging markets (includes, but is not limited to) asia (excluding japan and south korea), latin america, africa, eastern europe, central europe, the middle east and turkeyreferences to operational variances in this md&a pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange. the operational variances are determined by multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, our current period u.s. dollar results by the current period average foreign exchange rates and then multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year period average foreign exchange rates. although exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control. exchange rate changes, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the business; therefore, we believe presenting operational variances provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business.our significant business development activities include:•on february 3, 2017, we completed the sale of pfizer’s global infusion therapy net assets, his, to icu medical for up to approximately $900 million, composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, icu medical common stock and seller financing. at closing, we received 3.2 million newly issued shares of icu medical common stock, which we valued at approximately $428 million, a promissory note in the amount of $75 million and net cash of approximately $200 million before customary adjustments for net working capital. in addition, we are entitled to receive a contingent amount of up to an additional $225 million in cash based on icu medical’s achievement of certain cumulative performance targets for the combined company through december 31, 2019. the operating results of his are included in the condensed consolidated statement of income and eh’s operating results through february 2, 2017 and, therefore, our financial results, and eh’s operating results, for the second quarter of 2017 do not reflect any contribution from his global operations, while our financial results, and eh’s operating results, for the second quarter of 2016 reflect three months of his global operations. our financial results, and eh’s operating results, for the first six months of 2017 reflect approximately one month of his 46domestic operations and approximately two months of his international operations, while our financial results, and eh’s operating results, for the first six months of 2016 reflect six months of his global operations. assets and liabilities associated with his are presented as held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016. the his assets held for sale are reported in assets held for sale and his liabilities held for sale are reported in other current liabilities.•on december 22, 2016, which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to astrazeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the u.s., including the commercialization and development rights to the newly approved eu drug zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-avibactam), the marketed agents merrem™/meronem™ (meropenem) and zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets atm-avi and cxl (ceftaroline fosamil-avi). the total fair value of the consideration transferred for this business was approximately $555 million in cash plus contingent consideration of $490 million. commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of this business, and, in accordance with our international reporting period, our condensed consolidated financial statements, eh’s operating results, and cash flows for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 reflect approximately three months and five months, respectively, of the small molecule anti-infectives business acquired from astrazeneca.•on september 28, 2016, we acquired medivation for $81.50 per share. the total fair value of consideration transferred for medivation was approximately $14.3 billion in cash ($13.9 billion, net of cash acquired). of this consideration, approximately $365 million was not paid as of december 31, 2016, and was recorded in other current liabilities. substantially all of the remaining consideration was paid as of july 2, 2017. commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of medivation. therefore, medivation operations are reflected in our results of operations, ih’s operating results, and cash flows for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, but not for the second quarter and first six months of 2016.•on june 24, 2016, we acquired anacor for $99.25 per share. the total fair value of consideration transferred for anacor was approximately $4.9 billion in cash ($4.5 billion, net of cash acquired), plus $698 million debt assumed. commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of anacor. therefore, anacor operations are reflected in our results of operations, ih’s operating results, and cash flows for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, but for only five days in the second quarter and first six months of 2016.for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2. acquisitions, sale of hospira infusion systems net assets, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments and the “our strategy” and “our business development initiatives” sections of this md&a below.47our 2017

statements––note 5. tax matters.our operating environmentindustry-specific challengesintellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rightsthe loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with generic manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. we have lost exclusivity for a number of our products in certain markets and we have lost collaboration rights with respect to a number of our alliance products in certain markets, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years. also, if one of our patents is found to be invalid by judicial, court or administrative proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the u.s. patent and trademark office, the european patent office, or other foreign counterparts, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. for example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the united states. the invalidation of these patents could potentially allow a competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace.as a result of a patent litigation settlement with several generic manufacturers, generic versions of pristiq launched in the u.s. in march 2017. see the “intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rights” section of our 2016 financial report for additional information about (i) recent losses and expected losses of product exclusivity in the u.s., europe or japan impacting product revenues and (ii) recent losses of collaboration rights impacting alliance revenues. we expect to lose exclusivity for various other products in various markets over the next few years, including, among others, viagra in the u.s. in december 2017 and the expiration of the basic product patent for lyrica in the u.s. in december 2018. 49for additional information, see the “patents and other intellectual property rights” section in part i, item 1, “business” of our 2016 form 10-k.we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights whenever we deem appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues––major products” and “revenues––selected product discussion” sections of this md&a. for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation.regulatory environment/pricing and access––u.s. healthcare legislationin march 2010, the aca was enacted in the u.s. for additional information, see the “government regulation and price constraints” section in part i, item 1, “business” of our 2016 form 10-k. we recorded the following amounts as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation:•$81 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $63 million in the second quarter of 2016, and $139 million in the first six months of 2017 and $159 million in the first six months of 2016, recorded as a reduction to revenues related to the medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and •$95 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $92 million in the second quarter of 2016, and $132 million in the first six months of 2017 and $124 million in the first six months of 2016, recorded in selling, informational and administrative expenses, related to the fee payable to the federal government (which is not deductible for u.s. income tax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs.regulatory environment/pricing and access––government and other payer group pressuresgovernments, mcos and other payer groups continue to seek increasing discounts on our products through a variety of means, such as leveraging their purchasing power, implementing price controls, and demanding price cuts (directly or by rebate actions). in europe, japan, china, canada, south korea and some other international markets, governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to patients and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global economic pressures. in the u.s., a primary government activity with implications for pharmaceutical pricing is deficit reduction. any significant spending reductions affecting medicare, medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broad deficit-reduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. significant medicare reductions could also result if congress proceeds with certain proposals to convert the medicare fee-for-service program into a premium support program, or if it chooses to implement the recommendations made annually by the medicare payment advisory commission, which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the medicare program. similar reductions to medicare spending could result if the threshold for action by the independent payment advisory board (ipab) is reached, and the secretary of the department of health and human services (to whom responsibility for developing savings proposals specified in the aca is likely to default in the absence of a seated ipab) is required to identify savings. current projections by the centers for medicare and medicaid services office of the actuary indicate that the ipab threshold will not be reached before 2021.consolidation among mcos has increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private insurers. private third-party insurers, as well as governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for our products or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely impact revenue.additionally, efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect our business if implemented. there has recently been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals, and there are indications that there could be a presidential executive order that would focus on pharmaceuticals. we believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. we continue to work with stakeholders to ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system.adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. in 2017, we face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca, though the likelihood of repeal of the aca is now low given the recent failure of the senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of aca provisions. it is possible that the presidential administration could withhold the cost-sharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans serving low-income enrollees, although the 50revenues generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchanges under the aca are minor. there is no assurance that any replacement for or modification or repeal of the aca will not adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employer-sponsored insurance coverage. there have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which efforts have generally focused on increasing transparency about drug costs or limiting drug prices. recent legislation enacted includes, for example, a 2017 maryland law that prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from selling certain off-patent or generic drugs at prices that include “unconscionable” price increases. we cannot predict the success of current or future federal or state legislative efforts. we will continue to work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes and lower costs to the healthcare system.the potential for additional pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continues to be significant. some employers, seeking to avoid the tax on high-cost health insurance in the aca to be imposed in 2020, are already scaling back healthcare benefits and an increasing number are implementing high deductible benefit designs. this is a trend that is likely to continue, especially if proposals to limit the tax exclusion for employer sponsored health insurance ultimately become law. private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.overall, there is increasing pressure on u.s. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions. these new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. at the same time, these models can also expand utilization by encouraging physicians to screen, diagnose and focus on outcomes. outside the u.s., governments, including the different eu member states, may use a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries). this international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different countries and some third-party trade in our products between countries.in particular, international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation. price variations, exacerbated by international reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some european countries. in addition, several important multilateral organizations, such as the united nations (un) and the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), are increasing policy pressures and scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations (e.g., 2016 un high level panel report on access to medicines and 2017 oecd report on new health technologies––managing access, value and sustainability). government adoption of these recommendations may lead to additional pricing pressures.in response to the evolving u.s. and global healthcare spending landscape, we are continuing to work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major u.s. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products. further, we are seeking to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs. for additional information, see the “regulatory environment––pipeline productivity” and “competition” sections of our 2016 financial report.the global economic environmentin addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, are exposed to the economic cycle, which impacts our biopharmaceutical operations globally. •governments, corporations, and insurance companies, which provide insurance benefits to patients, have implemented increases in cost-sharing and restrictions on access to medicines, potentially causing patients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use less effective treatments. government financing pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria (e.g., through public or private health technology assessments), or other means of cost control. examples include europe, japan, china, canada, south korea and a number of other international markets. the u.s. continues to maintain competitive insurance markets, 51but has also seen significant increases in patient cost-sharing and growing government influence as government programs continue to grow as a source of coverage.•we continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets, including greece, where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. for further information about our accounts receivable, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.•significant portions of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international net assets, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen, the chinese renminbi, the u.k. pound, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. conversely, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates, including those changes resulting from the volatility following the u.k. referendum in which voters approved the exit from the eu, can impact our results and our financial guidance.the impact of possible currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations, including venezuela and more recently egypt, can impact our results and financial guidance. for further information about our exposure to foreign currency risk, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” and the “our financial guidance for 2017” sections of this md&a. •in june 2016, the u.k. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the eu, which is commonly referred to as “brexit”. in january 2017, the u.k. prime minister announced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and confirmed that the u.k. government will not seek continued membership in the eu single market. in march 2017, the u.k. government formally notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu after it triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of the exit and outlining the future relationship between the u.k. and the eu. this process is expected to be highly complex and the end result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the u.k. and the eu.we generated approximately 2% of our worldwide revenues from the u.k. in the first six months of 2017. however, except for the foreign currency exchange impact from the weakening u.k. pound relative to the u.s. dollar to date, there are no other immediate-term impacts to our business as there has not yet been a formal change in the relationship between the u.k. and the eu. in addition, because of the significant uncertainties associated with the negotiation process, any potential long-term impacts are not currently determinable.pfizer maintains a strong financial position while operating in a complex global environment. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated high quality by both s&p and moody’s. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial condition and credit ratings, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors” of our 2016 form 10-k.our strategywe believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. we continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. we continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize patient access and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. we remain 52firmly committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that extend and significantly improve their lives. by doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders. commercial operationswe manage our commercial operations through two distinct business segments: pfizer innovative health (ih) and pfizer essential health (eh). the ih and eh operating segments are each led by a single manager. each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain ipr&d projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof-of-concept. each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets.some additional information about our business segments follows: ih segment  eh segment●ih focuses on developing and commercializing novel, value-creating medicines and vaccines that significantly improve patients’ lives, as well as products for consumer healthcare.key therapeutic areas include internal medicine, vaccines, oncology, inflammation & immunology, rare diseases and consumer healthcare. ●eh includes legacy brands that have lost or will soon lose market exclusivity in both developed and emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile injectable products, biosimilars, select branded products including anti-infectives and, through february 2, 2017, his. eh also includes an r&d organization, as well as our contract manufacturing business.●we expect that the ih biopharmaceutical portfolio of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line and newly launched products will be sustained by ongoing investments to develop promising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to help ensure a pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need. the assets managed by ih are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers. ●eh is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. eh leverages our biologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. additionally, eh leverages capabilities in formulation development and manufacturing expertise to help advance its generic sterile injectables portfolio. eh may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its commercial strategies.●ih will have continued focus on r&d productivity and pipeline strength while maximizing the value of our recently launched brands and in-line portfolio. our acquisitions of anacor and medivation expanded our pipeline in the high priority therapeutic areas of inflammation and immunology and oncology. ●for eh, we continue to invest in growth drivers and manage the portfolio to extract additional value while seeking opportunities for operating efficiencies. this strategy includes active management of our portfolio; maximizing growth of core product segments; acquisitions to strengthen core areas of our portfolio further, such as our recent acquisition of astrazeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business; and divestitures to increase focus on our core strengths. in line with this strategy, on february 3, 2017, we completed the sale of pfizer’s global infusion therapy net assets, representing the infusion systems net assets that we acquired as part of the hospira transaction, his, to icu medical. leading brands include:- prevnar 13/prevenar 13- xeljanz- eliquis- lyrica (u.s., japan and certain other markets)- enbrel (outside the u.s. and canada)- viagra (u.s. and canada)- ibrance- xtandi- several otc consumer healthcare products (e.g., advil and  centrum)  leading brands include:- lipitor- premarin family- norvasc- lyrica (europe, russia, turkey, israel and central asiacountries)- celebrex- inflectra/remsima- several sterile injectable productsfor additional information about the 2017 performance for each of our operating segments, see the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a.53description of research and development operationsinnovation is critical to the success of our company, and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. our r&d priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies and vaccines with the greatest medical and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity. to that end, our research primarily focuses on:•biosimilars; •inflammation and immunology;•metabolic disease and cardiovascular risks;•neuroscience; •oncology;•rare diseases; and•vaccines.we continue to strengthen our global r&d organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in r&d to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. our r&d spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations: •research units within our wrd organization are generally responsible for research assets for our ih business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept). our research units are organized in a variety of ways (by therapeutic area or combinations of therapeutic areas, by discipline, by location, etc.) to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. because of our structure, we can rapidly redeploy resources within a research unit between various projects as necessary because the workforce shares similar skills, expertise and/or focus. •our r&d organization within the eh business supports the large base of eh products and is expected to develop potential new sterile injectable drugs and therapeutic solutions, as well as biosimilars. •our gpd organization is a unified center for late-stage development for our innovative products and is generally responsible for the clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our wrd and innovative portfolios. gpd is expected to enable more efficient and effective development and enhance our ability to accelerate and progress assets through our pipeline. gpd combines certain previously separate development-related functions from the ih business and the wrd organization to achieve a development capability that is expected to deliver high-quality, efficient, and well-executed clinical programs by enabling greater speed, greater cost efficiencies, and reduced complexity across our development portfolio. gpd also provides technical support and other services to pfizer r&d projects. •our science-based and other platform-services organizations, where a significant portion of our r&d spending occurs, provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects, and are organized into science-based functions (which are part of our wrd organization), such as pharmaceutical sciences, medicinal chemistry, regulatory and drug safety, and non-science-based functions, such as facilities, business technology and finance. as a result, within each of these functions, we are able to migrate resources among projects, candidates and/or targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases of development, allowing us to react quickly in response to evolving needs.we manage r&d operations on a total-company basis through our matrix organizations described above. specifically, a single committee with representation from the r&d groups and the ih commercial organization is accountable for aligning resources among all of our wrd, gpd and ih r&d projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative r&d portfolio. we believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility. our eh r&d organization manages its resources separately from the wrd and gpd organizations.generally, we do not disaggregate total r&d expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage a significant portion of our r&d operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, as conditions change, we believe that any prior-period information about r&d expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.while a significant portion of r&d is done internally, we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaborations, alliances and license agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. these agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. we also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments, revenue sharing payments, profit sharing payments and/or royalties. collaboration, alliance, license and 54funding agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost and to access external scientific and technological expertise, and enable us to advance our own products as well as in-licensed or acquired products.for additional information about r&d by operating segment, see the “analysis of operating segment information” section of this md&a. for additional information about our pending new drug applications and supplemental filings, see the “analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of income––product developments––biopharmaceutical” section of this md&a. for additional information about recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe have the potential to advance our pipeline, see the “our strategy––our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.intellectual property rightswe continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access. in addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches designed to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity. also, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by other companies that we believe were improperly granted. such challenges may include negotiation and litigation, which may not be successful. for additional information about our current efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights and certain other patent proceedings, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12a1. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings––patent litigation. for information on risks related to patent protection and intellectual property claims by third parties, see “risks related to intellectual property” in part i, item 1a, “risk factors” of our 2016 form 10-k.capital allocation and expense managementwe seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and robust liquidity so that we continue to have the financial resources necessary to take advantage of prudent commercial, research and business development opportunities and to directly enhance shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends. for additional information about our financial condition, liquidity, capital resources, share repurchases (including accelerated share repurchases) and dividends, see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a. for additional information about our recent business development activities, see the “our strategy––our business development initiatives” section of this md&a.we remain focused on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the company. for additional information about our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, see the “costs and expenses––restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.our business development initiativeswe are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. we continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen one or both of our businesses and their capabilities, such as our acquisitions of hospira, medivation, anacor, and astrazeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, as well as collaborations, and alliance and license agreements with other companies, including our collaborations with cellectis, opko and merck kgaa. we assess our businesses, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will advance our businesses. for additional information on our business development activities, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2. acquisitions, sale of hospira infusion systems net assets, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments.the more significant recent transactions and events are described below:•sale of hospira infusion systems net assets to icu medical, inc. (eh)––on february 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion therapy net assets, his, to icu medical. in connection with this transaction, in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, we recognized pre-tax losses of approximately $28 million and $64 million, respectively, in other (income)/deductions––net, representing incremental charges to amounts previously recorded to write down the his net assets to fair value less costs to sell. we may record additional adjustments to the loss on the sale of his net assets in future periods, pending final working capital adjustments and local market closes, among other agreement provisions, which we do not expect to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.55•acquisition of astrazeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business (eh)––on december 22, 2016, which falls in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for our international operations, we acquired the development and commercialization rights to astrazeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the u.s., including the commercialization and development rights to the newly approved eu drug zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-avibactam), the marketed agents merrem™/meronem™ (meropenem) and zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets atm-avi and cxl (ceftaroline fosamil-avi). the total fair value of the consideration transferred for this business was approximately $555 million in cash plus the fair value of contingent consideration of $490 million.•acquisition of medivation, inc. (ih)––on september 28, 2016, we acquired medivation for $81.50 per share. the total fair value of consideration transferred for medivation was approximately $14.3 billion in cash ($13.9 billion, net of cash acquired). medivation’s portfolio includes xtandi (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells. xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with astellas. astellas has exclusive commercialization rights for xtandi outside the u.s. in addition, medivation has a development-stage oncology asset in its pipeline, talazoparib, which is currently in a phase 3 study for the treatment of brca-mutated breast cancer.•acquisition of bamboo therapeutics, inc. (r&d)––on august 1, 2016, we acquired all the remaining equity in bamboo, a privately-held biotechnology company, focused on developing gene therapies for the potential treatment of patients with certain rare diseases relating to neuromuscular conditions and those affecting the central nervous system, for $150 million, plus potential milestone payments of up to $495 million contingent upon the progression of key assets through development, regulatory approval and commercialization. we previously purchased a minority stake in bamboo in the first quarter of 2016 for a payment of approximately $43 million. this acquisition provides us with several clinical and pre-clinical assets that complement our rare disease portfolio, an advanced recombinant aav vector design and production technology, and a fully functional phase i/ii gene therapy manufacturing facility. •acquisition of anacor pharmaceuticals, inc. (ih)––on june 24, 2016, we acquired anacor for $99.25 per share. the total fair value of consideration transferred for anacor was approximately $4.9 billion in cash ($4.5 billion net of cash acquired) plus $698 million debt assumed. anacor’s crisaborole, a non-steroidal topical pde-4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties, was approved by the fda on december 14, 2016 under the trade name eucrisa, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in patients two years of age and older, commonly referred to as a type of eczema. anacor also holds the rights to kerydin, a topical treatment for onychomycosis (toenail fungus) that is distributed and commercialized by sandoz in the u.s.•research and development arrangement with novaquest co-investment fund v, l.p.––in april 2016, pfizer entered into an agreement with novaquest under which novaquest will fund up to $200 million in development costs related to certain phase iii clinical trials of pfizer’s rivipansel compound and pfizer will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for such compound. novaquest’s development funding is expected to cover up to 100% of the development costs and will be received over approximately twelve quarters from 2016 to 2019. as there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to novaquest, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is a reduction of research and development expenses as incurred. the reduction to research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $14.8 million and for the first six months of 2017 totaled $32.0 million. the reduction to research and development expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 totaled $15.0 million. following potential regulatory approval, novaquest will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to approximately $267 million in total, based on achievement of first commercial sale and certain levels of cumulative net sales as well as royalties on rivipansel net sales over approximately eight years. fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to amortization of intangible assets over the estimated commercial life of the rivipansel product and royalties on net sales will be recorded as cost of sales when incurred.•research and development arrangement with rpi finance trust––in january 2016, pfizer entered into an agreement with rpi, a subsidiary of royalty pharma, under which rpi will fund up to $300 million in development costs related to certain phase iii clinical trials of pfizer’s ibrance (palbociclib) product primarily for adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive early breast cancer (the indication). rpi’s development funding is expected to cover up to 100% of the costs primarily for the applicable clinical trials through 2021. as there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to rpi, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services and therefore is a reduction of research and development expenses as incurred. the reduction to research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $12.3 million and for the first six months of 2017 totaled $26.8 million. the reduction to research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2016 totaled $12.9 million and for the first six months of 2016 totaled $21.7 million. if successful and upon approval of ibrance in the u.s. or certain major markets in the eu for the indication based on the applicable clinical trials, rpi will be eligible to receive a combination of approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $250 million dependent upon results of the clinical trials and royalties on certain ibrance sales over 56approximately seven years. fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to amortization of intangible assets over the estimated commercial life of the ibrance product and sales-based royalties will be recorded as cost of sales when incurred.•approval of besponsa––in june 2017, the european union approved besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory cd22-positive b-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all). in connection with this approval, we incurred an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over a nine year period aggregating $148 million related to a research and development arrangement. as a result, we recorded the estimated net present value of $118 million as developed technology rights, and $115 million in other noncurrent liabilities and $3 million in other current liabilities in the second quarter of 2017. if besponsa is approved in the united states for all, we will incur an obligation for additional fixed payments over a nine year period aggregating $296 million.•pending approval in the eu of mylotarg––mylotarg was developed, in part, through a research arrangement with a third party. if mylotarg is approved in the eu in 2018 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, we will incur an obligation for additional fixed payments over a 10 year period aggregating $310 million.for a description of the more significant recent transactions through february 23, 2017, the filing date of our 2016 form 10-k, see the “our business development initiatives” section of our 2016 financial report.our financial guidance for 2017on august 1, 2017, we updated our 2017 financial guidance previously issued on january 31, 2017 and reaffirmed on may 2, 2017. specifically, we raised the midpoint of our adjusted diluted eps guidance range by $0.02 to a range of $2.54 to $2.60 to reflect a $300 million increase to the guidance for adjusted other (income)/deductions due to lower-than-forecasted net interest expense as well as higher-than-forecasted royalty income from certain products and dividend income from viiv.additionally, the updated financial guidance absorbs $75 million of adjusted research and development expenses that were recorded in the second quarter of 2017 resulting from an agreement we entered into in may 2017 with sangamo to develop and commercialize gene therapy programs for hemophilia a, including sb-525, one of sangamo’s four lead product candidates. pfizer’s updated 2017 financial guidance is presented below(a), (b):revenues$52.0 to $54.0 billionadjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues20.0% to 21.0%adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses$13.7 to $14.7 billionadjusted research and development expenses$7.5 to $8.0 billionadjusted other

$2.60(previously $2.50 to $2.60)(a) the 2017 financial guidance reflects the following:•does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of july 2, 2017, including any one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions.•exchange rates assumed are a blend of the actual exchange rates in effect through june 2017 and mid-july 2017 exchange rates for the remainder of the year.•reflects an anticipated negative revenue impact of $2.4 billion due to recent and expected generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost or are anticipated to soon lose patent protection. •reflects the anticipated negative impact of $0.2 billion on revenues and $0.01 on adjusted diluted eps as a result of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar compared to foreign exchange rates from 2016.•guidance for adjusted diluted eps assumes diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of between 6.0 and 6.1 billion shares, which reflects the impact of our $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in february 2017 and completed in may 2017.(b) for an understanding of adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted eps (all of which are non-gaap financial measures), see the “non-gaap financial measure (adjusted income)” section of this md&a.pfizer does not provide guidance for gaap reported financial measures (other than revenues) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses and potential future asset impairments without unreasonable effort. these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on gaap reported results for the guidance period. for

driven by our ih segment as well as our sterile injectable pharmaceuticals portfolio.revenue deductionsour gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized, and primarily represent chargebacks, rebates and sales allowances to wholesalers, and, to a lesser extent, distributors like mcos, retailers and government agencies with respect to our pharmaceutical products. those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for the reporting period and, as such, knowledge and judgment of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues, and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues. product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.61the following table provides information about revenue deductions:  three months ended six months ended(millions of dollars) july 2, 2017 july 3, 2016 july 2,

maintenance organizations and pbms, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance terms and claims under these contracts. outside the u.s., performance-based contract rebates include rebates to wholesalers/distributors based on achievement of contracted performance for specific products or sales milestones.(c) chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to u.s. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.(d) sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the u.s., discounts and distribution fees.(e) for the three months ended july 2, 2017, associated with the following segments: ih ($2.2 billion) and eh ($2.5 billion). for the three months ended july 3, 2016, associated with

quarter of 2016, and total revenue deductions for the first six months of 2017 increased 11% compared to the first six months of 2016, primarily as a result of:•an increase in performance-based contract rebates primarily due to sales to managed care customers in the u.s., as well as higher rebates in certain markets outside the u.s.;•an increase in sales allowances primarily in markets outside the u.s.;•an increase in medicaid and related state program rebates, primarily as a result of updated estimates of sales related to these programs; and•an increase in chargebacks from certain ih products, partially offset by decreases across several eh products.our accruals for medicare rebates, medicaid and related state program rebates, performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts totaled $4.4 billion as of july 2, 2017, of which approximately $2.9 billion is included in other current liabilities, $369 million is included in

2016.in the u.s., revenues for prevnar 13 decreased 16% in the second quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the unfavorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication and the continued decline in revenues for the adult indication in the u.s. due to a high initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity (i.e., the opportunity to reach adults age 65 and older who have not been previously vaccinated with prevnar 13) compared to the prior-year quarter. given the success since the launch of the adult indication, approximately 52% of the eligible patient pool 65 years and above in the u.s. has already been vaccinated. while the remaining eligible population is large, this cohort is much more difficult to capture. in the u.s., revenues for prevnar 13 decreased 12% in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the aforementioned smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity for the adult indication compared to the same period in 2016, and the unfavorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication.internationally, revenues for prevenar 13 increased 8% operationally in the second quarter of 2017 and 2% operationally in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, primarily due to the favorable timing of government purchases in certain emerging markets for the pediatric indication. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. 64in 2014, the acip voted to recommend prevnar 13 for routine use to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which for adults includes pneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. these acip recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the cdc and u.s. department of health and human services, and were published in the morbidity and mortality weekly report in september 2014 by the cdc. as with other vaccines, the cdc regularly monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations; in this case, however, the cdc announced formally that it will conduct this review in 2018. a potential adverse change in the acip recommendation could negatively impact future prevnar 13 revenues. currently, we are working with a number of u.s. investigators to monitor the proportion of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes included in prevnar 13 and continue to observe trends.•lyrica (eh (revenues from all of europe, russia, turkey, israel and central asia)/ih

had a de minimis impact in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.65•sutent (ih) worldwide revenues were relatively flat operationally in the second quarter of 2017 and decreased operationally in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. the decrease in the first six months of 2017 was primarily due to competitive pressure in the u.s. and europe and cost containment measures in certain developed international markets. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•chantix/champix (ih) worldwide revenues increased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. in the u.s., chantix revenues increased 24% in the second quarter of 2017 and 18% in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016 primarily due to increased promotional activities, educating health care providers on updates to the chantix label, including removal of the boxed warning, the addition of eagles safety and efficacy data, improved patient access and positive price impact.•the premarin family of products (eh) worldwide revenues decreased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. revenues in the u.s. decreased 2% in the second quarter and 7% in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, primarily driven by volume declines and lower market growth, mainly offset by a positive price impact. internationally, premarin revenues decreased 12% operationally in the second quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower volume in brazil. internationally, premarin revenues decreased 8% operationally in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower volumes in mexico and the u.k. foreign exchange had a de minimis impact on international revenues in the second quarter of 2017 and had a favorable impact in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•norvasc (eh) worldwide revenues were relatively flat operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. results for the second quarter of 2017 were impacted by generic competition in japan and pricing pressures in china, offset by strong demand in china and middle eastern markets. results for the first six months of 2017 were impacted by generic competition in japan and pricing pressures in china, offset by strong demand in china. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•celebrex (eh) worldwide revenues were relatively flat operationally in the second quarter of 2017 and increased operationally in the first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. the increase in the first six months of 2017 was primarily driven by volume growth in emerging markets, primarily china and certain middle eastern markets, and favorable rebates in the u.s. this was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition in the u.s. and most developed international markets. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•benefix and refacto af/xyntha (ih)––benefix worldwide revenues decreased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, primarily as a result of erosion of market share in the u.s. and european countries due to increasing adoption of extended half-life treatment options as well as a price decrease in the u.k. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016. refacto af/xyntha worldwide revenues increased operationally in both the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, largely due to increased product demand in certain emerging markets, partially offset by declines in developed markets in europe and the u.s. primarily driven by increasing adoption of extended half-life treatment options. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•xalkori (ih) worldwide revenues increased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, as a result of a steady increase in diagnostic rates for the alk gene mutation across key markets outside the u.s., which has led to more patients being treated. this increase was partially offset by volume declines in the u.s. and japan due to competitive pressure, partially mitigated by the march 2016 fda approval of the supplemental nda to treat patients with metastatic nsclc whose tumors are ros1-positive. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•inlyta (ih) worldwide revenues decreased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, primarily due to increased competition in the u.s. and europe, partially offset by performance in key emerging markets. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•inflectra/remsima (eh) worldwide revenues increased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, due to continued uptake in developed markets in europe, and the u.s. launch in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by pricing pressures in europe. inflectra uptake in the u.s. is being driven by a number of factors including inflectra’s clinical data package, patient support programs, price and the access/reimbursement environment. to date, reimbursement coverage has been mixed. while we achieved 100% medicare coverage, we have experienced access challenges 66among national commercial payers where our lower priced product has not received access at parity to the innovator product and remains in a disadvantaged position despite recent price increases taken by the innovator product. we will look at all relevant factors impacting reimbursement given our extensive experience working with commercial payers to enable greater access for inflectra.•pristiq (eh) worldwide revenues decreased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, primarily due to loss of exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2017 resulting in significant generic competition. foreign exchange had a de minimis impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•zyvox (eh) worldwide revenues decreased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, due to generic competition in developed international markets and the u.s. and corresponding pricing pressures, partially offset by strong volume growth in china. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.•eucrisa (ih) is approved in the u.s. for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis for patients two years of age and older. the fda approved eucrisa on december 14, 2016, and eucrisa was launched in the u.s. late in the first quarter of 2017. eucrisa is a novel non-steroidal topical ointment and is the first topical prescription treatment for atopic dermatitis approved in over 10 years. while there was solid uptake in the demand for eucrisa and sequential prescription demand increased, net revenues have not followed the same pattern of growth. we expect this will normalize with net revenue sequential growth in the third quarter of 2017.•alliance revenues (ih/eh) increased operationally in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, mainly due to:◦an increase in eliquis alliance revenues due to higher demand resulting from increased market penetration of novel oral anticoagulants and market share gains; and◦the inclusion of xtandi alliance revenues of $141 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $272 million in the first six months of 2017 in the u.s. resulting from the september 2016 acquisition of medivation.foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on alliance revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016.◦eliquis (ih) has been jointly developed and is commercialized by pfizer and bms. pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study. profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where pfizer commercializes eliquis and pays bms compensation based on a percentage of net sales. we have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets, beginning in the third quarter of 2015. bms supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers in these markets. eliquis is part of the novel oral anticoagulant (noac) market; the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment options to warfarin in appropriate patients.◦xtandi (ih) is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with astellas. the two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related to u.s. net sales of xtandi. subject to certain exceptions, pfizer and astellas also share equally all xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the u.s. market. pfizer and astellas also share certain development and other collaboration expenses and pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international xtandi net sales (recorded in other (income)/deductions—net). while there has been some displacement in xtandi revenues relative to demand growth in the u.s., reflecting an increase in utilization of patient assistance programs which provide free medicines to patients, we expect patient assistance program utilization as a percentage of total demand to normalize as we move into next year.see the “analysis

with respect to our biologics license application (bla) for retacrit, our proposed biosimilar to epoetin alfa, which was submitted for all indications of the reference product. in december 2016, we completed the resubmission of the bla to the fda for retacrit in response to the “complete response” letter. in may 2017, the fda’s odac voted to recommend retacrit for approval. in june 2017, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda, relating to matters noted in a warning letter issued in february 2017 following a routine inspection of the company’s facility in mcpherson, kansas in 2016. this facility was listed as the potential manufacturing site in the bla for the proposed epoetin alfa biosimilar. the issues noted in the warning letter do not relate specifically to the manufacture of epoetin alfa. no additional clinical data was requested at this time and we continue to work closely with the fda on next steps. (e) in may 2012, the fda’s peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. in june 2012, the fda issued a “complete response” letter with respect to the tafamidis nda. the fda has requested the completion of a second efficacy study, and also has asked for additional information on the data within the current tafamidis nda. pfizer initiated study b3461028 in december 2013, a global phase 3 study to support a potential new indication in transthyretin cardiomypathy, which includes transthyretin familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (ttr-fac) and wild-type cardiomyopathy (wt-cm). we anticipate results from this study in 2018, and continue to work with the fda to identify next steps.68regulatory approvals and filings in the eu and japanproductdescription of eventdate approveddate

related to integrating acquired businesses, and primarily include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes of $50 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $151 million

restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.included in restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are (i) restructuring charges of $141 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $170 million for the first six months of 2016 for employee termination costs, exit costs and asset impairments, which are largely associated with cost-reduction and productivity initiatives not associated with acquisitions; (ii) transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other similar services, of $36 million in the second quarter of 2016, most of which are directly related to our acquisition of anacor, and $60 million for the first six months of 2016, most of which include costs related to the anacor acquisition, as well as the terminated transaction with allergan; and (iii) integration costs, representing external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, and primarily include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, of $139 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $227 million for the first six months of 2016, primarily related to our acquisition of hospira and the terminated transaction with allergan.in connection with our acquisition of hospira, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. we expect to achieve $1 billion of annual cost savings by 2018 in connection with the hospira acquisition, 25% more than our initial cost savings target of $800 million, and have achieved approximately $700 million of cost savings through july 2, 2017. the one-time costs to generate the savings are expected to be approximately $1 billion (not including costs of $215 million for full-year 2015 associated with the return of acquired ipr&d rights), incurred for up to a three-year period post-acquisition.73in 2016, we substantially completed previously disclosed cost-reduction initiatives begun in 2014 associated with our global commercial structure reorganization, manufacturing plant network rationalization and optimization initiatives, and additional cost-reduction/productivity initiatives across the enterprise. through december 31, 2016, we incurred $3.1 billion (pre-tax) in total costs for the 2014-2016 program. the cumulative ongoing annual cost savings associated with the 2014-2016 program (but not including expected cost savings associated with the hospira acquisition), are approximately $3.1 billion. these savings were recognized, for the most part, through the end of 2016. however, savings from costs incurred in the last half of 2016 are expected to largely occur in 2017 and are reflected in our 2017 financial guidance.new cost-reduction/productivity initiatives—2017 through 2019 activitiesas a result of the evaluation performed in connection with our decision in september 2016 to not pursue, at that time, splitting ih and eh into two separate publicly-traded companies, we have identified new opportunities to potentially achieve greater optimization and efficiency to become more competitive in our business. therefore, we have initiated new enterprise-wide cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, which we expect to complete by the end of 2019. these initiatives will encompass all areas of our cost base and will include further centralization of our corporate and platform functions and optimization of our manufacturing plant network to support ih and eh products and pipelines, as well as activities in other areas where opportunities are identified. the action plans related to these new initiatives are underway and, in order to achieve targeted savings of approximately $1.2 billion by 2020, we expect to incur total costs of approximately $900 million over the next three years. of this amount, we expect about 80% to be manufacturing operations related and we expect about a quarter of the total charges will be non-cash. for additional information about these programs and expected and actual total costs, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives. the expected cost savings in 2017 associated with these activities are reflected in our 2017 financial guidance.in addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.other (income)/deductions—net  three months ended six months ended(millions of dollars) july 2, 2017 july 3, 2016 %change july 2,

income is an alternative view of performance used by management. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. because adjusted income is an important internal measurement for pfizer, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted income, certain components of adjusted income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines, vaccines and consumer healthcare (otc) products––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are described below. also, see the “non-gaap financial measure (adjusted income)––general description of non-gaap financial measure (adjusted income)” section of our 2016 financial report for additional information. similarly, we have defined the adjusted income components as cost of sales, selling, informational and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, amortization of intangible assets and other (income)/deductions––net, each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. we have defined adjusted diluted earnings per share as earnings per common share attributable to pfizer inc.––diluted before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure, the adjusted income component measures and the adjusted diluted earnings per share measure are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for u.s. gaap net income, u.s. gaap net income components or u.s. gaap diluted earnings per share. the following are examples of how the adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share measures are utilized:•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share basis;•our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share basis; and•senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share measures. see the “non-gaap financial measure (adjusted income)––general description of non-gaap financial measure (adjusted income)” section of our 2016 financial report for additional information.adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-gaap financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. because of their non-standardized definitions, adjusted income and its components (unlike u.s. gaap net income and its components) and adjusted diluted earnings per share (unlike u.s. gaap diluted earnings per share) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.we also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, the adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted earnings per share measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these metrics. a limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly-traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans.see the accompanying reconciliations of certain gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted information for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 and 2016 below.purchase accounting adjustmentsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with wyeth (acquired in 2009), hospira (acquired in 2015), anacor (acquired in june 2016) and medivation (acquired in september 2016), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets (primarily manufacturing facilities), amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.75acquisition-related costsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.discontinued operationsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. certain significant itemsadjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of their nature. certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. for example, major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs stand on their own as they are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, but we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to loss of exclusivity or economic conditions. legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. unusual items may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under u.s. gaap; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12a. commitments and contingencies: legal proceedings, included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements of and accruals for legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.76reconciliations of gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted information––certain line items  three months ended july 2, 2017in millions, except per common share data gaap reported purchase

items included in gaap reported but excluded from non-gaap adjusted income” below.(b) the effective tax rate on non-gaap adjusted income was 22.9% in the second quarter of 2017, which was comparable to the effective tax rate of 22.7% in the second quarter of 2016. the effective tax rate on non-gaap adjusted income was 22.6% in the first six months of 2017, compared with 23.1% in the first six months of 2016. this decline was primarily due to a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.(c) gaap reported and non-gaap adjusted amounts for the three and six months ended july 3, 2016 have been revised from previously reported amounts to reflect the adoption of a new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016, as of january 1, 2016, requiring: (i) excess tax benefits or deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividend equivalents) of share-based compensation to be recognized as a component of the provision for taxes on income (the net tax benefit was $28 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $50 million in the first six months of 2016) and (ii) in the diluted net earnings per share calculation, when applying the treasury stock method for shares that could be repurchased, the assumed proceeds no longer include the amount of excess tax benefit. for additional information, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1b. adoption of new accounting standards in pfizer’s 2016 financial report.78details of income statement items

organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our ih business until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the ih segment via the gpd organization for possible clinical and commercial development. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. the wrd organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects, including eh r&d projects. wrd is also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities.(ii) gpd––the costs associated with our gpd organization, which is generally responsible for the clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our wrd and innovative portfolios. gpd also provides technical support and other services to pfizer r&d projects.(iii) corporate—the costs associated with corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement) and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments. effective in the first quarter of 2017, corporate also includes the costs associated with our pfizer medical organization (medical), previously reported as part of other business activities. medical is responsible for the provision of medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, transparency and disclosure activities, clinical trial results publication, grants for healthcare quality improvement and medical education, and partnerships with global public health and medical associations. we have reclassified approximately $34 million and $61 million of medical costs from other business activities to corporate in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, to conform to the current period presentation. we recognized a $26 million gain in the second quarter of 2017 and a $71 million gain in the first six months of 2017 as an offset to cost of sales related to foreign currency forward-exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of a portion of our foreign exchange-denominated forecasted intercompany inventory sales.(iv) other unallocated—other unallocated costs, representing overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing and commercial operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs (which include manufacturing variances associated with production).for information purposes only, the following tables present reconciliations of our segment operating results to segment operating results including estimated other costs generally associated with each segment. while we do not manage our segments or have performance goals under such an allocated manner, we believe that some investors may find this information useful in their analyses. 83the estimated other costs generally associated with our operating segments do not purport to reflect the additional amounts that each of our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the period presented. for information purposes only, for the first six months of 2017, we estimate that other costs, as described above, for combined wrd and gpd costs of $1.4 billion, and combined corporate and other unallocated costs of $2.6 billion after excluding (i) net interest-related expense not attributable to an operating segment included in corporate (approximately $470 million for the first six months of 2017 in other (income)/deductions––net); and (ii) net income from investments and other assets not attributable to an operating segment included in corporate (approximately $96 million for the first six months of 2017 in other (income)/deductions––net), are generally associated with our operating segments, as follows:  six

regional or country revenues or global, regional or country headcount, as well as certain cost metrics, as appropriate, such as those derived from research and development and manufacturing costs, and, to a lesser extent, specific identification and estimates. management believes that the allocations of corporate and other unallocated costs are reasonable.the estimated other costs generally

injectable pharmaceuticals portfolio and the legacy established products portfolio, largely offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4%. excluding his in both periods, eh revenues in emerging markets grew 6% operationally.costs and expensesthe changes in eh expenses below reflect, among other things, the favorable impact of the february 2017 sale of his. the operating results of his are included in eh’s operating results through february 2, 2017 and, therefore, operating results for eh for the first six months of 2017 include approximately one month of his domestic operations and approximately two months of his international operations, while operating results for eh for the first six months of 2016 reflect six months of his global operations.•cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased 1.1 percentage points, primarily due to cost increases reflecting the shift to eh of certain legacy hospira costs that were previously unallocated to eh as a result of harmonizing the hospira cost policy, and the impact of product losses of exclusivity, partially offset by the favorable impact of the sale of his, which had a higher cost of sales than the other eh products, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.•the decrease in cost of sales of 8% primarily reflects the favorable impact of the sale of his, which had a higher cost of sales than the other eh products, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by cost increases reflecting the shift to eh of certain legacy hospira costs that were previously unallocated to eh as a result of harmonizing the hospira cost policy.•selling, informational and administrative expenses decreased 8%, primarily due to lower advertising, promotional, field force and certain other expenses related to disputes in the ordinary course of business, as well as the favorable impact of the sale of his and the favorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by increased spending for biosimilars, primarily related to the u.s. launch of inflectra. •research and development expenses decreased 13%, primarily due to the close-out of certain post-marketing clinical trials and the favorable impact of the sale of his.•the unfavorable change in other (income)/deductions––net primarily reflects the non-recurrence of a resolution of a contract disagreement in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by a gain on the redemption of an acquired bond and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.88analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive incomechanges in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 reflect the following: •for foreign currency translation adjustments, net, for the second quarter of 2017, primarily reflects the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the euro and british pound, partially offset by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the australian dollar; for the first six months of 2017, primarily reflects the weakening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, british pound and the swedish krona. for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, also includes the reclassification of amounts related to the agreement to sell our 40% ownership investment in teuto. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2d.

additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 7. financial instruments.•for benefit plans: actuarial gains/(losses), net, for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, primarily reflects (i) the remeasurement gain due to the settlement of the hospira u.s. qualified defined benefit plan; (ii) the amortization of changes in the pension benefit obligation previously recognized in other comprehensive income; and (iii) the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial

generally reflect, among other things, the impact of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition of astrazeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, measurement period adjustments related to the acquisitions of medivation and anacor and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the following explanations exclude the impact of the acquisition of astrazeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, measurement period adjustments related to the acquisitions of medivation and anacor, as well as the sale of his to icu medical (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2. acquisitions, sale of hospira infusion systems net assets, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments and note 9. identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for additional information) and foreign exchange.•for trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, the change reflects the timing of sales and collections in the normal course of business.•for inventories, the change primarily reflects the build of inventory primarily for and in advance of new product launches and to meet targeted levels for certain products, partially offset by inventory reductions in the normal course of business.•for other current assets, the change reflects a decrease in receivables associated with our derivative financial instruments, a decrease in receivables from royalty agreements as a result of contract terminations, as well as the timing of receipts and payments in the normal course of business.•for pp&e, the change reflects depreciation during the period, partially offset by capital additions in the normal course of business.89•for identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, the change primarily reflects amortization for the period, partially offset by intangible assets recorded in connection with the eu approval of besponsa. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 7e. financial instruments: other noncurrent liabilities.•for other noncurrent assets, the change reflects net increases in the normal course of business, partially offset by a decrease in receivables associated with our derivative financial instruments.•for trade accounts payable, the change reflects the timing of purchases and payments in the normal course of business, including the impact of efforts to improve working capital efficiencies.•for accrued compensation and related items, the decrease reflects normal bonus payments made to employees and a reduction related to the termination of a hospira u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plan, partially offset by current year’s accruals. for additional information, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 10. pension and other postretirement benefit plans.•for other current liabilities, the change reflects a decrease in liabilities associated with:◦payment for consideration transferred for medivation;◦payments for restructuring activities, liabilities related to the closeout of bococizumab clinical studies and product liability claims;◦a decrease in liabilities associated with our derivative financial instruments; and◦the timing of payments for accrued interest, partially offset by:◦an accrual for net funds due to icu medical for net economic benefit payments (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2b. acquisitions, sale of hospira infusion systems net assets, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: sale of hospira infusion systems net assets to icu medical, inc. (eh)); and ◦the impact of timing of payments in the normal course of business.•for pension benefit obligations, net, the decrease primarily reflects the $1.0 billion voluntary pension contribution in january 2017 and payments to plan participants.•for other noncurrent liabilities, the change reflects a reduction from: ◦the reversal of a contingent liability as a result of exiting our investment in teuto (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2d. acquisitions, sale of hospira infusion systems net assets, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: equity method investments); ◦a decrease in liabilities associated with our derivative financial instruments; and◦an increase in reclassification of short-term liabilities and accruals in the normal course of business, partially offset by:◦an increase to record an obligation in connection with the eu approval of besponsa (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 7e. financial instruments: other noncurrent liabilities); and◦an increase in deferred revenue from a milestone payment received from merck for the ertugliflozin collaboration agreement (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2c. acquisitions, sale of hospira infusion systems net assets, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: collaboration arrangement).•for treasury stock, the change reflects $5 billion paid to citibank in february 2017 pursuant to the terms of an accelerated share repurchase agreement. see notes to condensed consolidated financial

revised from previously reported amounts to reflect the adoption of a new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016, as of january 1, 2016, that requires that cash flows present (i) excess tax benefits as other tax accounts, net as part of operating activities, rather than financing activities on a prospective basis beginning in the year of adoption, and (ii) cash paid by us when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes as a cash outflow from financing activities, rather than operating activities and is reflected in the year of adoption. the year-to-date excess tax benefit was $51 million in the first six months of 2016. for cash paid by us for withholding purposes, $133 million for the first six months of 2016 is presented as financing activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows (see notes to consolidated financial statements—note 1b. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: adoption of new accounting standards).in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the line item other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures is presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these changes do not reflect actual cash inflows or outflows, and excluding any other significant non-cash movements. accordingly, the amounts shown will not necessarily agree with the changes in the assets and liabilities that are presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.operating activitiesour net cash provided by operating activities was $4.8 billion in the first six months of 2017, compared to $5.4 billion in the same period in 2016. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors in the ordinary course of business, as well as an increase in our net income after adjustments for the non-cash changes.in the first six months of 2017, the line item other adjustments, net primarily reflects, among other items, the decrease in the provision for bad debt expense, an increase in dividends from equity-method investments reclassified to investing activities in 2017 and an increase in net gains on sales of pp&e.in the first six months of 2017 and 2016, the line item other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily reflects changes, in the normal course of business, in trade accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, trade accounts payable, accrued compensation and other current and noncurrent liabilities. for the first six months of 2016, this line item also includes the adjustments necessary to reflect the payments of certain legal claims accrued in prior periods, including for protonix-related matters. for additional information about accounts receivable, see also the “selected measures of liquidity and capital resources: accounts receivable” section of this md&a. for additional information about changes in other assets and liabilities account balances, see also “analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets” in this md&a. investing activitiesour net cash provided by investing activities was $3.0 billion in the first six months of 2017, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $323 million in the same period in 2016. the change in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to:•a decrease in cash used for acquisitions—cash paid of $1.0 billion, net of cash acquired, primarily for the acquisition of astrazeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business in 2017 and substantially all of the remaining consideration for the medivation acquisition, compared to cash paid of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of anacor in 2016 (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2a. acquisitions, sale of hospira infusion systems net assets, collaborative arrangement and equity-method investments: acquisitions); and•an increase in other investing activities, net, including dividends received from equity-method investments,partially offset by:•less net proceeds generated from the sale of investments of $638 million in 2017 for cash needs.financing activitiesour net cash used in financing activities was $7.9 billion in first six months of 2017, compared to $5.3 billion in the same period in 2016. the change in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:•$2.2 billion less proceeds raised from net short-term borrowings in the first six months of 2017, compared to the first six months of 2016,partially offset by:•the issuance of long-term debt of $5.3 billion in the first six months of 2017, compared to $5.0 billion in the same period in 2016 (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 7d. financial instruments: long-term debt).91supplemental schedule of non-cash investing and financing informationfor further details on supplemental cash flow information, see condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resourceswe rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. we continue our efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies. we target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other working capital, which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows. due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:•the working capital requirements of our operations, including our r&d activities;•investments in our business;•dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;•share repurchases;•the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;•paying down outstanding debt;•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and•business-development activities.our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both s&p and moody’s. see the “credit ratings” section below. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified available-for-sale debt securities.selected measures of liquidity and capital

financial instruments for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held.(b) the increase in selected net financial liabilities is primarily driven by (i) our decrease in short-term investments, the proceeds of which were used for various cash needs and (ii) the net increase in long-term debt. we retain a strong financial liquidity position as a result of our net cash provided by operating activities, our high-quality financial asset portfolio and access to capital markets. both moody’s and s&p rating agencies maintained our strong investment-grade corporate debt rating subsequent to the acquisitions of medivation and anacor. for additional information, see the “credit ratings” section of this md&a.(c) the increase in working capital is primarily due to the timing of accruals, cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, an increase in inventory related to new products, and a decline in short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decline in short-term investments used for various cash needs.(d) represents total pfizer inc. shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of common shares outstanding (which excludes treasury stock).for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the “analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets” and the “analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows” sections of this md&a.92on march 17, 2017, we completed a public offering of $1.065 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2047 with an interest rate of 4.20%, and on march 6, 2017, we completed a public offering of €4.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 0.23% (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 7d. financial instruments: long-term debt).domestic and international short-term fundsmany of our operations are conducted outside the u.s., and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. we generally hold up to $10 billion of these short-term funds in u.s. tax jurisdictions. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s. federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided.accounts receivablewe continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. historically, payments from a number of these european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale. specifically, we received delayed payments for 2016 revenues from the greek government; the vast majority of greece government receivables pertain to 2017 revenues. also, the greek government restructured its debt to other third parties in the third quarter of 2016. we determined our allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect these events, and have $29 million in net receivables from the greek government as of july 2, 2017. reported revenues from all customers in greece for the six months ended july 2, 2017 were $121 million. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on an analysis of the following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistency of payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).as of july 2, 2017, we had about $506 million in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in italy, spain, greece and portugal where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $65 million, were as follows: $45 million in italy; $14 million in portugal; $3 million in greece; and $3 million in spain.although certain european governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to appropriately balance repayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.we will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1c. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions included in our 2016 financial report.credit ratingstwo major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s and s&p, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.93the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:name of rating agency pfizer commercial paper

to stable.(b) in april 2016, s&p updated their credit outlook from negative watch to stable.debt capacitywe have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of july 2, 2017, we had access to $7.7 billion of lines of credit, of which $665 million expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $7.7 billion were unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.0 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of our unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2021, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings.global economic conditions––generalthe global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. we monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions. global economic conditions––u.k.in june 2016, the u.k. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the eu, which is commonly referred to as “brexit”. in january 2017, the u.k. prime minister announced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and confirmed that the u.k. government will not seek continued membership in the eu single market. in march 2017, the u.k. government formally notified the european council of its intention to leave the eu after it triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of the exit and outlining the future relationship between the u.k. and the eu. this process is expected to be highly complex and the end result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the u.k. and the eu.we generated approximately 2% of our worldwide revenues from the u.k. in the first six months of 2017. however, except for the foreign currency exchange impact from the weakening u.k. pound relative to the u.s. dollar to date, there are no other immediate-term impacts to our business as there has not yet been a formal change in the relationship between the u.k. and the eu. in addition, because of the significant uncertainties associated with the negotiation process, any potential long-term impacts are not currently determinable.global economic conditions––venezuela operationsour venezuela operations continue to operate with the u.s. dollar as the functional currency due to the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy. in the second quarter of 2015, the venezuelan government identified three official rates of exchange. these are the cencoex rate of 6.3; the sicad rate of 13.5 (as of august 2017); and, after the international quarter end, there was a change in the venezuelan government foreign exchange system resulting in the simadi rate of 2,970 (as of august 2017). effective in march 2016, the cencoex rate was replaced by the dipro rate of 10 (as of february 2017); the sicad rate ceased to be offered; and the simadi rate was planned to be replaced by the dicom rate, but the dicom rate is not published. the venezuelan government continues to publish the simadi rate, which is commonly referred to as the dicom rate, and that rate has grown from 206 in march 2016 to about 2,970 (as of august 2017). based on conditions in venezuela, we resolved that our venezuelan bolivar-denominated net monetary assets that are subject to revaluation are no longer expected to be substantially settled at the venezuelan government cencoex official rate of 6.3 or the dipro official rate of 10, but at a rate of 500 at the end of the second quarter and third quarter of 2016, and 670 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and at the end of the first and second quarter of 2017.94we cannot predict whether there will be further devaluations of the venezuelan currency or whether our use of the dicom rate will continue to be supported by evolving facts and circumstances. further, other potential actions by the venezuelan government in response to economic uncertainties could impact the recoverability of our investment in venezuela, which could result in an impairment charge and, under extreme circumstances, could impact our ability to continue to operate in the country in the same manner as we have historically.on july 11, 2016, the venezuelan government administration announced a new program under a state of emergency decree that is intended to control the use of raw materials, production and distribution of products, specifically for medicines and foods. it is uncertain how this program will be applied to pfizer in venezuela. we continue to operate under adverse conditions in venezuela and have $17 million of net monetary assets and $44 million of non-monetary assets, excluding inventory carried at lower of cost or market, in venezuela at may 28, 2017, our international quarter-end.off-balance sheet arrangementsin the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of july 2, 2017, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications were not significant.certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.share-purchase plans and accelerated share repurchase agreementsour october 2014 $11 billion share-purchase plan was exhausted in the first quarter of 2017. in december 2015, the board of directors authorized an $11 billion share repurchase program, and share repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2017.on february 2, 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with citibank to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock. for additional information, see notes to

standards.recently issued accounting standards, not adopted as of july 2, 2017the following table provides a brief description of recently issued accounting standards, not yet adopted: standard/description effective date  effect on the financial statements or other significant mattersin may 2014, the fasb issued amended guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. the new guidance introduces a new principles-based framework for revenue recognition and disclosure. since its issuance the fasb has issued six asus, amending the guidance and effective date, and the sec has rescinded certain related sec guidance; the most recent of these changes was issued in december 2016. january 1, 2018.  we have made substantial progress in completing our review of the impact of this guidance across our various business arrangements and revenue-related activities, and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements and revenue recognition practices, or our internal controls. we expect that milestone payments received in our collaboration agreements, which are recorded in other (income)/deductions––net, and currently amortized over the life of the agreement, will, for many arrangements, be amortized over the development period. we are reviewing our disclosures for revenue recognition and do not anticipate significant changes will be needed to conform with the disclosure requirements of the new guidance. we continue to monitor additional changes, modifications, clarifications or interpretations undertaken by the fasb, which may impact our current conclusions. in addition, we continue to monitor other changes, such as changes in our business, new collaboration arrangements, business combinations, etc., which may impact our current conclusions prior to the adoption date. in january 2016, the fasb issued an update to its guidance on recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. among other things, the new guidance makes the following targeted changes to existing guidance:1. requires certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. however, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.2. requires a qualitative assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values to identify impairment.3. requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. january 1, 2018. we have substantially completed our review and will continue to assess events which may occur prior to adoption. as of july 2, 2017, we have $488 million in available-for-sale equity securities and approximately $694 million of restricted stock and private equity securities which will be subject to the new rules. further, for the six months ended july 2, 2017, we recognized $170 million of unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale equity securities in other comprehensive income, which would have been recorded to other (income)/deductions––net under the new rules. we expect the adoption of this new accounting standard may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. the impact of adoption will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.in august 2016, the fasb issued new guidance on the classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. january 1, 2018. earlier application is permitted. we have substantially completed our review and will continue to assess events which may occur prior to adoption. upon adoption, we expect to reclassify approximately $362 million of cash outflows related to debt redemption in 2016 from operating activities to financing activities. we also expect to reclassify approximately $32 million of cash inflows from trust-owned life insurance contracts in 2016 from operating activities to investing activities. cash outflows from trust-owned life insurance contracts represent benefit payments and are classified as operating activities. in addition, the new guidance may impact the classification of certain cash flows related to contingent consideration in a business acquisition, depending on the ultimate settlement amount of the contingency.96standard/description effective date  effect on the financial statements or other significant mattersin october 2016, the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. january 1, 2018. earlier application is permitted. we have not yet completed our review of the impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. however, our restricted cash balances as of the end of 2016 were approximately $18.1 million of short-term restricted cash and $45.3 million of long-term restricted cash. our restricted cash balances as of july 2, 2017 were approximately $0.4 million of short-term restricted cash and $51.5 million of long-term restricted cash.in october 2016, the fasb issued an update to its guidance on income tax accounting. the new guidance replaces the prohibition against recognizing current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party with a requirement to do so, unless the asset transferred is inventory.  january 1, 2018.  our analysis of the standard indicates that our estimate of the impact to our consolidated financial statements, using current assumptions, is not material. however, while we currently do not have any specific plans, we cannot predict intercompany asset transfers other than inventory that may occur in the future, as they are dependent on economic and operational factors that may change over time. for example, an acquisition might cause us to realign legal entities and to transfer assets between entities as we integrate an acquired company into pfizer. we anticipate that after adoption, our effective tax rate could be impacted by the immediate recognition of the tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory. the impact of adoption will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings.in january 2017, the fasb issued new guidance to clarify the definition of a business. the new guidance provides a new framework for determining whether business development transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. if the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, the transaction will not qualify for treatment as a business. the new guidance also requires that to be considered a business, a set of integrated activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, without regard as to whether a market participant could replace missing elements. in addition, the new guidance narrows the definition of the term “output” to make it consistent with how outputs are described in the updated revenue recognition guidance. january 1, 2018. earlier application is permitted. we have made substantial progress in completing our review of this guidance. the new accounting standard is applicable on a prospective basis upon adoption and therefore has no impact on completed transactions. we expect that subsequent to our anticipated adoption date of january 1, 2018, fewer transactions will be accounted for as business acquisitions (decreasing the amount of goodwill incurred and potentially increasing ipr&d expense) or disposals of a business. we will continue to monitor for changes in our business, and business combination or other transactions which might close after adoption and be impacted by these new standards.in february 2017, the fasb issued amended guidance related to the derecognition of nonfinancial assets.  january 1, 2018. earlier application is permitted. we have not yet completed our review of the impact of this new guidance on ourconsolidated financial statements. however, we are not expecting a material impact on existing transactions.in march 2017, the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. under the new rules, entities that sponsor defined benefit plans will present net benefit cost as follows:1. service cost will be included in the same income statement line items where other employee compensation costs are reported.2. the other components of net benefit cost will be presented outside of income from operations, if such a subtotal is presented.3. only the service cost component will be capitalized, when applicable (for example, as a cost of inventory, internal-use software, or a self-constructed fixed asset).if a separate line item is used to present the other components of net benefit cost, it should have an appropriate description. if a separate line item or items is not used, the line item or items in the income statement where the other components of net benefit cost are included must be disclosed. january 1, 2018. we have not yet completed our review of the impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements, although we anticipate that after adoption, the net benefit costs other than service costs will be reclassified to other (income)/deductions—net from their current classification within cost of sales, selling, informational and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses. effective january 1, 2018, future accruals under the pfizer consolidated pension plan (our largest u.s. defined benefit plan), will freeze, and the pfizer defined contribution savings plan will provide additional annual contributions to those previously accruing benefits under the pfizer consolidated pension plan. this change will result in elimination of future service costs for the plan.in may 2017, the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards. the new guidance clarifies that changes in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award be accounted for as a modification unless all the following conditions are met:1.the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.2.the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.3.the modification does not change the classification of the award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument. january 1, 2018. early application is permitted, including in interim periods. we have not yet completed our review of the impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. however, any impact will be dependent upon whether we make any future modifications of share-based payment awards, and we have no plans to modify share-based payment awards at this time.97standard/description effective date  effect on the financial statements or other significant mattersin february 2016, the fasb issued an update to its guidance on leases. the new asu provides guidance for both lessee and lessor accounting models. among other things, the new guidance requires that a right of use asset and a lease liability be recognized for leases with a duration of greater than one year. january 1, 2019. earlier application is permitted. we have not yet completed our review of the impact of this guidance. however, we anticipate recognition of at least $2 billion of additional assets and corresponding liabilities on our balance sheet. we are currently assessing the potential impact of embedded leases on our consolidated financial statements, given our manufacturing outsourcing and other agreements. in connection with this guidance we will need to design new processes and technological solutions to provide the appropriate financial accounting and disclosure data.in march 2017, the fasb issued new guidance that shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. the new guidance requires the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. january 1, 2019. early application is permitted, including in interim periods, so long as any adjustments are reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period in which the guidance is applied. we are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.in july 2017, the fasb issued new guidance on accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, and accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features (a feature in a financial instrument that reduces the strike price of an issued financial instrument if the issuer sells shares of its stock for an amount less than the currently stated strike price of the issued financial instrument or issues an equity-linked financial instrument with a strike price below the currently stated strike price of the issued financial instrument). january 1, 2019. earlier application is permitted. we are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.in june 2016, the fasb issued new guidance on accounting for credit losses of financial instruments. the new guidance replaces the incurred losses methodology in current gaap with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses using an allowance account.  january 1, 2020. earlier application is permitted as of fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. we are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.in january 2017, the fasb issued new guidance for goodwill impairment testing. the new guidance eliminates the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. under the new guidance the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, although it cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  january 1, 2020. earlier application is permitted. we have not yet completed our review of the impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. however, we do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.98forward-looking information and factors that may affect future resultsthis report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “likely,” “ongoing,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, our anticipated operating and financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, including anticipated regulatory submissions, approvals, performance and potential benefits of pfizer’s products and product candidates, strategic reviews, capital allocation, business-development plans and plans relating to share repurchases and dividends. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, our acquisitions and other business development activities, the disposition of the his net assets, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans relating to share repurchases and dividends, government regulation and financial results, including, in particular, the financial guidance set forth in the “our financial guidance for 2017” section of this md&a, the anticipated costs and cost savings, including from our acquisition of hospira and our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives set forth in the “costs and expenses––restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a and in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 3. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, the benefits expected from our business development transactions,

drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries; restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising; limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals; or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines; as well as pricing pressures for our products as a result of highly competitive insurance markets;•legislation or regulatory action in markets outside the u.s. affecting pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including, in particular, continued government-mandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs in those markets;•the exposure of our operations outside the u.s. to possible capital and exchange controls, expropriation and
