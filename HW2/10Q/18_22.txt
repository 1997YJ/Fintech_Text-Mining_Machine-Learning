the second quarter of 2011 was another record quarter for revenue as the trends of strength in our
server business, increased demand from the enterprise market segment and emerging markets, offset
by weakness in the mature market consumer segment have continued throughout the first half of 2011.
in the second quarter of 2011 we achieved double digit percentage revenue growth in our data center
group and pc client group compared to the second quarter of 2010. average selling prices for
microprocessors in our pc client group have increased from last year in part from the continued
successful ramp of our 2nd generation intel® coretm processor products
(formerly code-named sandy bridge). our second quarter results also include a full quarter of
revenue for mcafee, inc. and the wireless solutions (wls) business of infineon technologies ag, which we acquired
during the first quarter of 2011. we continue to believe we are on track for another year of
revenue growth over 20 percent.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

gross margin in the second quarter of 2011 was slightly down from the first quarter as start-up
costs for our 22nm process technology reached an expected peak and platform (microprocessor and
chipset) unit costs were higher on the ramp of additional 32nm factories. these negative impacts to
our gross margin were mostly offset by lower charges to repair and replace materials and systems
impacted by a design issue related to our intel® 6 series express chipset family. we
expect our gross margin percentage to increase in the third quarter on seasonally higher volume,
lower start-up costs for our 22nm process technology, lack of charges related to the chipset design
issue, and lower platform unit costs.

we increased our expectation for research and development and marketing and general and
administrative expenses in 2011 from $15.7 billion to $16.2 billion, primarily on expected
investments in areas that we believe will drive future revenue growth. these investments are
focused on redefining the pc category with new form factors, such as ultrabooktm system
designs; strengthening our server product offerings; strengthening our product offerings for
tablets and smartphones; as well as extending our process technology leadership. we also increased
our expectation for capital spending this year from our previous estimate of $10.2 billion to $10.5
billion, as we expect to put capabilities in place that will allow us to re-use capital in
succeeding process technologies.

the cash generation from our business remained strong with cash from operations of $4.0 billion in
the second quarter of 2011. from a financial condition perspective, we ended the second quarter of
2011 with an investment portfolio of $11.5 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. during the
second quarter of 2011, we purchased $2.5 billion in capital assets, repurchased $2.0 billion of
common stock through our common stock repurchase program, and returned $1.0 billion to stockholders
through dividends. in july, the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.21 per common share
for the third quarter of 2011(a per share increase of 16% from the dividend paid in the second
quarter).

strategy

our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital
economy. we believe that the proliferation of the internet and cloud computing have driven
fundamental changes in the computing industry. we are transforming from a company with a primary
focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for pcs and servers to a computing
company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and
supporting services. the number and variety of devices connected to the internet is growing, and
computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience. end users value consistency across
devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the internet and to each other. we will help to
enable this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing: energy-efficient
performance, connectivity, and security.




 
•
 
energy-efficient performance. we are focusing on improved energy-efficient
performance for computing and communications systems and devices. improved energy-efficient
performance involves balancing higher performance with lower power consumption.


 

 
•
 
connectivity. we are positioning our business to take advantage of the growth
in devices that compute and connect to the internet. in the first quarter of 2011, we
acquired the wls business of infineon. this acquisition enables us to offer
a portfolio of products that covers a broad range of wireless connectivity options by
combining the intel® wifi and intel® wimax technologies with wls’ 2g
and 3g technologies, and creates a combined path to accelerate industry adoption of 4g lte.


 

 
•
 
security. our goal is to enhance security features through a combination of
hardware and software solutions. this may include identity protection and fraud deterrence;
detection and prevention of malware; securing data and assets; as well as system recovery
and enhanced security patching. in the first quarter of 2011, we acquired mcafee. we
believe this acquisition accelerates and enhances our hardware and software security
solutions, improving the overall security of our platforms.



to succeed in the changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives:




 
•
 
strive to ensure that intel technology remains the best choice for the pc as well as
cloud computing and the data center. our ultrabooktm system designs will enable
a new user experience by accelerating a new class of mobile computers that use low power
processors. these computers will combine the performance and capabilities of today’s
laptops and tablets in a thin and light form factor that is highly responsive, secure, and
seamlessly connects to the internet and other enabled devices.


 

 
•
 
expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new solutions to the
smartphone, the tablet, the tv, the car, and the embedded world.


 

 
•
 
enable devices that connect to the internet and to each other to create a continuum of
personal computing. this continuum would give consumers a set of secure, consistent, and
personalized computing experiences.


 

 
•
 
positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our
energy-efficient technology.



33



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we will use our core assets to meet these objectives. our core assets include our silicon and
process technology, our architecture and platforms, our global presence, our strong relationships
across the industry, and our brand recognition. we believe that applying these core assets to our
key focus areas provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new
technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly. some of our core assets and key focus areas
are:




 
•
 
silicon and manufacturing technology leadership. we have long been a leader in silicon
process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment
and innovation in this critical area. we drive a regular two-year upgrade
cycle—introducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the
next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. we refer to this as
our “tick-tock” technology development cadence. as we continue to drive moore’s law over
the next several years, we believe that the value of this leadership will increase.
we have accelerated the intel® atomtm processor-based system-on-chip roadmap
for netbooks, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm
within 3 successive years. we expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage, lower active power, and an increase of transistor density to enable more powerful smartphones, tablets, and netbooks with more features and longer battery life.
 additionally, we aim to have the best process technology, and unlike most
semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. this
allows us to optimize performance, reduce our time to market, and scale new products more
rapidly.


 

 
•
 
architecture and platforms. we are now developing a wide range of solutions for
devices that span the computing continuum, from pcs, ultrabook systems, tablets, and
smartphones to smart tvs and in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. users want
computing experiences that are consistent and devices that are interoperable. users and
developers value consistency of architecture, which provides a common framework that allows
for reduced time to market, with the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form
factors. we believe that we can meet the needs of both users and developers by offering
intel® architecture-based computing solutions across the computing continuum. we
continue to invest in improving intel architecture so that we can deliver increased value
to our customers in existing market segments and also expand the capabilities of the
architecture to meet end-user and customer needs in adjacent market segments. increasingly,
we are delivering our architecture in the form of platforms. platforms include not only the
microprocessor, but other critical hardware and software ingredients that are necessary to
create computing solutions. we are expanding our platform capabilities with connectivity
solutions, new types of user interfaces, new features and capabilities, and complementary
software.


 

 
•
 
software. we enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing
development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and
operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. we seek to expedite growth in
various market segments, such as the embedded and handheld market segments, through our
software offerings. additionally, we have collaborated with other companies to develop
software platforms optimized for our intel® atomtm processors and
that support multiple hardware architectures as well as multiple operating systems.


 

 
•
 
customer orientation. our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of
products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. in turn, our products help
enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and
consumers. we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured
to work together to provide an optimized solution compared to components that are used
separately. additionally, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield
innovation and improved technologies for users.


 

 
•
 
strategic investments. we make investments in companies around the world that
we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support
our key business initiatives. our investments, including those made through our intel
capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate
growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for intel, and expand
global markets for our products.


 

 
•
 
stewardship. we are committed to developing energy-efficient technology
solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our
environmental impact. we are also committed to helping transform education globally through
our technology, program, and policy leadership, as well as funding through the intel
foundation. in addition, we strive to cultivate a work environment where engaged, energized
employees can thrive in their jobs and in their communities.



our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen
our competitive position as we enter and expand into new market segments. we believe that these new
market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for
notebook and desktop computers. we also believe that increased internet traffic and use of cloud
computing create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for
energy-efficient performance and virtualization.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

critical accounting estimates

the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial
statements. some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.
our most critical accounting estimates include:




 
•
 
the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments,
net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;


 

 
•
 
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and
equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating
expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;


 

 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including
the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes;


 

 
•
 
the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and


 

 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross
margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for
a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment.



below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.

non-marketable equity investments

we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from
early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature
companies with established revenue streams and business models. the carrying value of our
non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.7 billion as
of july 2, 2011 ($2.6 billion as of december 25, 2010). approximately half of this balance as of
july 2, 2011 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. our flash memory
market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies, llc (imft) and im flash
singapore, llp (imfs) of $1.3 billion ($1.5 billion as of december 25, 2010). for further
information, see “note 11: equity method investments” in the notes to consolidated
condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of
accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable equity
investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance
sheets.

non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product
development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, the ability of the investee companies to
raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile, and other key business factors.
the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive
lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. these events could
cause our investments to become impaired. in addition, financial market volatility could negatively
affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial
public offerings, mergers, and private sales. for further information about our investment
portfolio risks, see “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of this 
form 10-q.

we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure
purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is
recognized. we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market
and income approaches. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of
comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance
multiples. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a
number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, development
stages, and other relevant factors. the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow
model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following
significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed
market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the
risk profile of comparable companies. estimates of market segment size, market segment share,
expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed using historical data and available
market data. the valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account
variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the
investees, the investees’ capital structures, and the terms of the investees’ issued interests.

35



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

for non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment
and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that
impact the fair value of the investment, such as:




 

 
•
 
the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business
prospects;


 
•
 
the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;


 

 
•
 
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area,
including adverse regulatory or economic changes;


 

 
•
 
factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the
investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash;
and


 

 
•
 
the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.



if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is
other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes
assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before
disposal. if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the
investment to its fair value. impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $8 million in
the second quarter of 2011 ($22 million in the first half of 2011). over the past 12 quarters,
including the second quarter of 2011, impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from
$8 million to $896 million per quarter. this range included impairments of $896 million during the
fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in
clearwire communications, llc.

imft/imfs

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand
products to intel and micron technology, inc. at manufacturing cost. we determine the fair value of
our investment in imft/imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business, which requires the use of
unobservable inputs. unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective
judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. changes in management
estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value
determination. we have not had an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in imft/imfs.

long-lived assets

property, plant and equipment

we assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable.
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant
under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative
industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.
we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by
comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future
undiscounted net cash flows. if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the
related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is
measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair
value. property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair
value only if an impairment charge is recognized.

impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable
independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our
semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the
independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective
judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor
manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the
assets’ new, shorter useful lives. over the past 12 quarters, including the second quarter of 2011,
impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $10 million to $75
million per quarter.

goodwill

goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair
value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. goodwill is allocated to our
reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to
our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit.

36



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of
potential impairment exist, to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is
impaired. our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which
goodwill resides to its carrying value. reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an
operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. our reporting units are
consistent with the operating segments identified in “note 27: operating segment information” in
the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned
to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further
testing. if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair
value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order
to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. if the carrying value of a
reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal
to the difference.

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions. our impairment review process uses the income method to estimate the reporting unit’s
fair value and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting
unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and intel’s assumed market
segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’
weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost
of capital of comparable companies. our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment
share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external
sources, and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. the same estimates
are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as
part of our capital budgeting process and for both long-term and short-term business planning and
forecasting. we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow
analysis against available comparable market data. in determining the carrying value of the
reporting unit, we must include an allocation of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets
because of the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity. this
allocation is based on each reporting unit’s relative percentage utilization of our manufacturing
and assembly and test assets.

during the fourth quarter of each of the prior two fiscal years, we completed our annual impairment
reviews and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in either of these years.

identified intangibles

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. recoverability of finite
lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future
undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. we review indefinite lived intangible
assets for impairment quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is
measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the
asset is expected to generate. if it is determined that an individual asset is impaired, the amount
of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of
the impaired asset.

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our
intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by various
factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such
as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. based on our
impairment reviews of our intangible assets, we have not recognized any impairment charges in 2011
or 2010.

income taxes

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement
purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and
deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from
differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement
purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant
changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a
subsequent period.

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery
is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we
will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance
sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our
tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.
recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to
holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect
to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes.

37



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we
determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step
requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to
estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we
re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors
such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively
settled issues. determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires
judgment. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax
benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

inventory

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
inventory that is not of saleable quality. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory
requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. the estimate of future demand is
compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. as of july 2, 2011, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1.5
billion and total finished goods inventory of $2.0 billion. the demand forecast is included in the
development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation
and build decisions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation
process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products,
consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the
selling price in relation to the product cost. if our demand forecast for specific products is
greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be
required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.

in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine
normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings
compared to total available capacity. if the factory loadings are below the established normal
capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of
inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would
negatively impact our gross margin. we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. over the
past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter.

loss contingencies

we are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential
claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as
well as product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the
ordinary course of business. an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to
income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated based on the best information available at that time. a loss contingency is
disclosed when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. the
outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product
warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. significant judgment is
required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is
reasonably estimable. with respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing
parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates,
costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customer’s manufacturing process.
at least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our
estimates as additional information becomes available. these revisions could have a material impact
on our results of operations and financial position.

our net revenue for q2 2011 increased $2.3 billion, or 21%, compared to q2 2010. the increase was
due to higher platform (microprocessor and chipset) average selling prices and $1.0 billion in
revenue from intel mobile communications (formerly the wls business of infineon) and mcafee. we
acquired the wls business of infineon and mcafee in q1 2011. revenue in the americas, europe,
asia-pacific, and japan regions increased by 34%, 21%, 20%, and 3%, respectively, compared to q2
2010.

our overall gross margin dollars for q2 2011 increased $667 million, or 9%, compared to q2 2010.
the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. the increase was partially offset
by approximately $430 million of higher start-up costs compared to q2 2010. to a lesser extent,
higher platform unit costs also offset the increase to our overall gross margin dollars. the
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $137 million reduction to our overall
gross margin dollars in q2 2011, compared to $16 million in q2 2010, primarily due to the
acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon.

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 60.6% in q2 2011 from 67.2% in q2 2010. the
decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage
decrease in the pc client group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin
percentage decrease in the other intel architecture operating segments. we derived a majority of
our overall gross margin dollars in q2 2011 and a substantial majority of our overall gross margin
dollars in q2 2010 from the sale of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group
operating segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by $820 million, or 11%, in q2 2011 compared
to q2 2010. microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those designed for the notebook and
desktop computing market segments. the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly
higher notebook average selling prices. to a lesser extent, higher desktop average selling prices
and slightly higher notebook unit sales also contributed to the increase. the increase in chipset,
motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales.

operating income decreased by $49 million in q2 2011 compared to q2 2010. the decrease in operating
income was due to approximately $400 million of higher start-up costs and, to a lesser extent,
higher platform unit costs and higher inventory write-offs in q2 2011 compared to q2 2010. these
decreases were partially offset by higher revenue compared to q2 2010.

data center group

the revenue and operating income for the data center group (dcg) operating segment for q2 2011 and
q2 2010 were as follows:

net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by $322 million, or 15%, in q2 2011 compared to
q2 2010. the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly higher microprocessor unit
sales and, to a lesser extent, slightly higher microprocessor average selling prices. the increase
in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher revenue from the sale of
wired connectivity products, and slightly higher chipset unit sales.

operating income increased by $143 million in q2 2011 compared to q2 2010. the increase in
operating income was primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses
compared to q2 2010.

other intel architecture operating segments

the revenue and operating income for the other intel architecture (other ia) operating segments,
including intel mobile communications (imc), the embedded and communications group (ecg), the
netbook and tablet group (ntg), the digital home group (dhg), and the ultra-mobility group (umg),
for q2 2011 and q2 2010 were as follows:

net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by $634 million, or 84%, in q2 2011
compared to q2 2010. the increase was primarily due to imc revenue, an operating segment formed
from the acquisition of the wls business of infineon. to a lesser extent, significantly higher ecg
microprocessor unit sales and significantly higher ecg microprocessor average selling prices also
contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by significantly lower ntg
microprocessor unit sales.

operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by $109 million, from an operating
gain of $76 million in q2 2010 to an operating loss of $33 million in q2 2011. the decline in
operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within each of the other ia
operating segments, partially offset by higher revenue.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

software and services operating segments

the revenue and operating income for the software and services operating segments, including
mcafee, wind river software group, and software and services group, for q2 2011 and q2 2010 were as
follows:

(14
)
 
$
(48
)




net revenue for the software and services operating segments increased by $446 million in q2 2011
compared to q2 2010. the increase was primarily due to revenue from the acquisition of mcafee and,
to a lesser extent, significantly higher revenue from the wind river software group. due to the
revaluation of mcafee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value, we excluded $80 million of revenue
that would have been reported in q2 2011 if mcafee’s deferred revenue had not been written down due
to the acquisition.

operating loss for the software and services operating segments decreased by $34 million in q2 2011
compared to q2 2010, primarily due to higher revenue and operating expenses from the acquisition of
mcafee. due to the revaluation of mcafee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value, we excluded
revenue and associated costs that would have created $75 million of operating income in q2 2011.

operating expenses

operating expenses for q2 2011 and q2 2010 were as follows:

research and development. r&d spending increased by $320 million, or 19%, in q2 2011 compared to q2
2010. this increase was primarily due to the expenses of mcafee and intel mobile communications, and
higher compensation expense based on an increase in employees. these increases were partially
offset by lower process development costs as we transition from r&d to manufacturing using our 22nm
process technology.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by
$321 million, or 20%, in q2 2011 compared to q2 2010. this increase was primarily due to the
expenses of mcafee and intel mobile communications, and higher compensation expense based on an
increase in employees.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in q2
2011 and q2 2010.

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. the increase of $72 million was primarily due to
the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of
infineon, both completed in the first quarter of 2011. for further information, see “note 15:
acquisitions” and “note 18: identified intangible assets” in the notes to consolidated condensed
financial statements of this form 10-q.

we recognized lower gains on other equity transactions, partially offset by higher gains on sales
of other equity investments in q2 2011 compared to q2 2010.

“other, net” for q2 2010 was primarily related to fair value gains on the equity interest in
micron we received from the sale of our ownership interest in numonyx and gains on equity options
established prior to the numonyx sale that economically hedged a portion of our micron equity
interest. during q2 2011, we sold our remaining ownership interest in micron and the related equity
options matured.

the effective tax rate for q2 2011 was positively impacted by a higher percentage of profits being
derived from lower tax jurisdictions, the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to the
settlement of an uncertain tax position, and higher domestic manufacturing deductions compared to
q2 2010. additionally, q2 2011 included the u.s. research and development tax credit that was
reinstated in december 2010.

our net revenue for the first half of 2011, which included 27 weeks, increased $4.8 billion, or
23%, compared to the first half of 2010, which included 26 weeks. the increase was primarily due to
higher platform (microprocessor and chipset) average selling prices and, to a lesser extent,
slightly higher microprocessor unit sales. revenue from intel mobile communications (formerly the
wls business of infineon) and mcafee contributed $1.5 billion to q2 2011 revenue. revenue in the
americas, asia-pacific, europe, and japan regions increased by 38%, 22%, 19%, and 7%, respectively,
compared to the first half of 2010.

our overall gross margin dollars increased by $2.0 billion, or 15%, compared to the first half of
2010. the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. the increase was partially
offset by approximately $580 million of higher start-up costs compared to the first half of 2010.
in addition, a charge of $422 million recorded in the first half of 2011 to repair and replace
materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel® 6 series express
chipset family, also offset the increase to our overall gross margin dollars. for further
information, see “note 20: chipset design issue” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q. the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a
$210 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in the first half of 2011, compared to
$32 million in the first half of 2010, primarily due to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls
business of infineon.

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 61.0% in the first half of 2011 from 65.3% in the
first half of 2010. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross
margin percentage decrease in the pc client group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, the
gross margin percentage decrease in the other intel architecture operating segments. we derived a
substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in the first half of 2011 and first half
of 2010 from the sale of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group operating
segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by $2.1 billion, or 14%, in the first half of
2011 compared to the first half of 2010. microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those
designed for the notebook and desktop computing market segments. the increase in microprocessor
revenue was due to significantly higher notebook average selling prices. to a lesser extent, higher
notebook unit sales, higher desktop average selling prices, and slightly higher desktop unit sales
also contributed to the increase. the increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due
to significantly higher chipset unit sales.

operating income increased by $407 million in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of
2010. the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue. the increase was
partially offset by approximately $580 million of higher start-up costs. in addition, a charge of
$422 million recorded in the first half of 2011 to repair and replace materials and systems
impacted by a design issue related to our intel® 6 series express chipset family also
contributed to the offset. to a lesser extent, inventory write-offs and platform unit costs were
higher compared to the first half of 2010, which also contributed to the offset.

data center group

the revenue and operating income for the data center group (dcg) operating segment for the first

net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by $915 million, or 23%, in the first half of
2011 compared to the first half of 2010. the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to
significantly higher microprocessor unit sales and, to a lesser extent, slightly higher
microprocessor average selling prices. the increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was
due to significantly higher revenue from the sale of wired connectivity products and higher chipset
unit sales.

operating income increased by $532 million in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of
2010. the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by
higher operating expenses compared to the first half of 2010.

other intel architecture operating segments

the revenue and operating income for the other intel architecture (other ia) operating segments,
including intel mobile communications (imc), the embedded and communications group (ecg), the
netbook and tablet group (ntg), the digital home group (dhg), and the ultra-mobility group (umg),

net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by $1.1 billion, or 78%, in the first
half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010. the increase was primarily due to imc revenue, an
operating segment formed from the acquisition of the wls business of infineon. to a lesser extent,
significantly higher ecg microprocessor and chipset unit sales and significantly higher ecg
microprocessor average selling prices also contributed to the increase. these increases were
partially offset by significantly lower ntg microprocessor unit sales.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by $171 million from an operating
gain of $102 million in the first half of 2010 to an operating loss of $69 million the first half
of 2011. the decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within
each of the other ia operating segments, partially offset by higher revenue.

software and services operating segments

the revenue and operating income for the software and services operating segments, including
mcafee, wind river software group, and software and services group, for the first half of 2011 and
the first half of 2010 were as follows:

net revenue for the software and services operating segments increased by $628 million in the first
half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010. the increase was primarily due to revenue from the
acquisition of mcafee and, to a lesser extent, significantly higher revenue from the wind river
software group. due to the revaluation of mcafee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value, we
excluded $110 million of revenue that would have been reported in the first half of 2011 if
mcafee’s deferred revenue had not been written down due to the acquisition.

operating loss for the software and services operating segments decreased by $26 million in the
first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010. the impact of higher revenue was mostly
offset by higher operating expenses across each of the software and services operating segments.
due to the revaluation of mcafee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value, we excluded revenue and
associated costs that would have created $103 million of operating income in the first half of
2011.

research and development. r&d spending increased by $672 million, or 21%, in the first half of 2011
compared to the first half of 2010. this increase was primarily due to the expenses of mcafee and
intel mobile communications, and higher compensation expenses based on an increase in employees, as
well as an extra work week in the first half of 2011. these increases were partially offset by
lower process development costs as we transition from r&d to manufacturing using our 22nm process
technology.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by
$582 million, or 19%, in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010. this increase
was primarily due to the expenses of mcafee and intel mobile communications, and higher
compensation expenses based on an increase in employees, as well as an extra work week in the first
half of 2011.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 29% of net revenue in the
first half of 2011 (30% of net revenue in the first half of 2010).

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. the increase of $105 million was primarily due to
the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of
infineon, both completed in the first quarter of 2011. for further information, see “note 15:
acquisitions” and “note 18: identified intangible assets” in the notes to consolidated condensed
financial statements of this form 10-q.

first half of 2010. gains on sales of equity investments in the first half of 2010 included a gain
of $67 million on the sale of shares in micron.

“other, net” in the first half of 2011 primarily related to gains in our micron equity interest
acquired in the sale of numonyx in q2 2010, partially offset by the change in fair value of micron
equity options that economically hedged our equity interest. “other, net” in the first half of 2010
primarily related to fair value gains on our equity interest in micron. during q2 2011, we sold our
remaining ownership interest in micron, and the related equity options matured.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

the effective tax rate for the first half of 2011 was positively impacted by a higher percentage of
profits being derived from lower tax jurisdictions compared to the first half of 2010, as well as
the reversal of previously accrued taxes in the first half of 2011 related to the settlement of an
uncertain tax position. the effective tax rate for the first half of 2011 also included the u.s.
research and development tax credit that was reinstated in december 2010.

status of business outlook

we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately
with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the
“business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q, including any such statements that are
incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. at the same time, we will keep this form 10-q and our
most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at
www.intc.com. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as
representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating
otherwise. the statements in the “business outlook” section and other forward-looking statements in
this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings
releases and securities and exchange commission (sec) filings and at other times.

the forward-looking statements in the “business outlook” section will be effective through the
close of business september 16, 2011 unless earlier updated. from the close of business on
september 16, 2011 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for
october 18, 2011, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet period, the “business outlook”
section and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on july 20,
2011, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be considered historical,
speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period,
our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or
expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we
utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes
in assets and liabilities.

cash from operations for the first half of 2011 was $8.0 billion, an increase of $419 million
compared to the first half of 2010 due to adjustments for non-cash items, primarily depreciation
and amortization of intangibles, and higher net income, partially offset by changes in our working
capital.

changes in assets and liabilities as of july 2, 2011 compared to december 25, 2010 included the
following:




 
•
 
accrued compensation and benefits decreased due to payout of 2010
profit-dependent compensation.


 

 
•
 
income taxes receivable increased due to an increase in income tax prepayments.



for the first half of 2011, our two largest customers accounted for 35% of net revenue (38% for the
first half of 2010) with one of those customers accounting for 19% of our net revenue, and another
customer accounting for 16% of our net revenue. these two largest customers accounted for 30% of
net accounts receivable at july 2, 2011 (44% at december 25, 2010).

investing activities

cash used for investing activities decreased in the first half of 2011, compared to the first half
of 2010, primarily due to net sales and maturities of available-for-sale investments and trading
assets during the first half of 2011 as compared to net purchases of available-for-sale investments
and trading assets during the first half of 2010, partially offset by higher cash paid for
acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, an increase in capital expenditures as we build and equip our
22nm process technology manufacturing capacity.

financing activities

the increase in cash used for financing activities in the first half of 2011, compared to the first
half of 2010, was primarily due to repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock
repurchase program during the first half of 2011.

liquidity

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. as of july 2, 2011, cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets
totaled $11.5 billion ($21.5 billion as of december 25, 2010). the majority of the decrease from
the fourth quarter of 2010 is due to the cash required to fund our acquisition of mcafee in the
first quarter of 2011. in addition to the $11.5 billion, we have $1.9 billion in loans receivable and other
long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. substantially all of
our investments in debt instruments are with a/a2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial
majority of the issuers are rated aa-/aa3 or better.

48



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing
authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the
issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the
first half of 2011 were $200 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of july
2, 2011. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of july 2,
2011. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which
we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next
12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test,
working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions
or strategic investments.

fair value of financial instruments

when determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we
would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
asset or liability. see “note 5: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q.

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at
fair value on a recurring basis. when fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a
discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk or intel’s credit risk is factored into the
calculation of the fair value, as appropriate.

marketable debt instruments

as of july 2, 2011, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included
$12.1 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $1.8 billion was classified as
level 1, $10.0 billion as level 2, and $270 million as level 3.

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable
market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. management judgment was
required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market
to be considered active. our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments
generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a
specified period.

of the $10.0 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on
a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 55% of the balance was classified as
level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 45% due to the use of
non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data.

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to
corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when
observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and
non-binding broker quotes using available  unobservable data.

equity securities

as of july 2, 2011, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $902 million of marketable equity securities. most of these securities were
classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities
in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities
generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades
over a specified period.
