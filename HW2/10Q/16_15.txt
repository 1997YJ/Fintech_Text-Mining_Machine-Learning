follow.      net income attributable to chevron corporation for third quarter 2013 was $5.0 billion ($2.57 per share — diluted), compared with $5.3 billion ($2.69 per share — diluted) in the corresponding 2012 period. net income attributable to chevron corporation for the first nine months of 2013 was $16.5 billion ($8.52 per share — diluted), versus $18.9 billion ($9.62 per share — diluted) in the first nine months of 2012.upstream earnings were $5.1 billion in third quarter 2013 and the comparative 2012 period. higher crude oil realizations and volumes were offset by the absence of a 2012 gain on a wheatstone equity sale and higher operating expenses. earnings for the first nine months of 2013 were $16.0 billion compared with $16.9 billion a year earlier. the decrease between comparative periods was mainly due to lower crude oil realizations, the absence of the 2012 gain on the wheatstone equity sale, and higher operating and depreciation expenses, partially offset by foreign currency effects, higher gas realizations and lower taxes.downstream earnings were $380 million in third quarter 2013, compared with $689 million in the year-earlier period. the decline was mainly due to lower margins on refined products. earnings for the first nine months of 2013 were $1.8 billion, compared with $3.4 billion in the corresponding 2012 period. the decrease was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales, higher operating expenses at the company's refineries and lower gains on asset sales.refer to pages 29 through 32 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for third quarter and first nine months of 2013 versus the same period in 2012.business environment and outlookchevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, cambodia, canada, chad, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, the netherlands, nigeria, norway, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, the philippines, republic of the congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, venezuela, and vietnam.25table of contentsearnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream and downstream business segments. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the company is the price of crude oil. in the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year.to sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the investment required. identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in this effort. projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments.the company’s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the united states. from time to time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the company. governments may attempt to do so in the future. civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may impact the company’s operations or investments. those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses.the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control. external factors include not only the general level of inflation, but also commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.26table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $112 per barrel for the full-year 2012. during 2013, brent averaged $110 per barrel in the third quarter, $108 per barrel for the nine-month period, and ended october at about $107. during third quarter 2013, brent prices strengthened as seasonal demand combined with geopolitical unrest and supply disruptions to tighten markets. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. the wti price averaged $94 per barrel for the full-year 2012. during 2013, wti averaged $106 per barrel in the third quarter, $98 for the nine-month period, and ended october at about $96. wti traded at a discount to brent throughout 2012 due to high inventories and excess crude supply in the u.s. midcontinent market. after narrowing during the first six months of 2013, the wti discount slowly widened during the third quarter as brent prices were generally more impacted by international events.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand, which is a function of the capacity of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light products (motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). the differential strengthened in the second quarter 2013 as global refinery maintenance activities eased, and continued to strengthen through the third quarter as supply disruptions in key producing countries tightened light, sweet crude markets.chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, chad, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 35 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil realizations.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $3.67 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in the first nine months of 2013, compared with $2.51 during the first nine months of 2012. at the end of october 2013, the henry hub spot price was $3.56 per mcf. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. in some locations, chevron is investing in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. international natural gas realizations averaged $5.96 per mcf during the first nine months of 2013, compared with $6.00 in the same period last year. (see page 35 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the u.s. and international regions.)the company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2013 averaged 2.60 million barrels per day. about one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first nine months of 2013 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria, venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for the third quarter or nine-month periods of 2013 or 2012. at their may 2013 meeting, members of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of 30 million barrels per day, which has been in effect since december 2008.27table of contentsproduction in any given year is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by opec, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups or ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the united states.the company estimates that net oil-equivalent production for the full-year 2013 will average about 98 to 99 percent of the previously-announced target of 2.650 million barrels per day. the production shortfall is primarily due to the slower-than-anticipated ramp-up of angola lng, higher-than-planned turnaround activity at several locations, and lightning-related damage to a gas plant in thailand.on november 7, 2011, while drilling a development well in the deepwater frade field about 75 miles offshore brazil, an unanticipated pressure spike caused oil to migrate from the well bore through a series of fissures to the sea floor, emitting approximately 2,400 barrels of oil. the source of the seep was substantially contained within four days and the well was plugged and abandoned. no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impacts related to this seep has emerged. on march 14, 2012, the company identified a small, second seep in a different part of the field. as a precautionary measure, the company and its partners decided to temporarily suspend field production and received approval from brazil’s national petroleum agency (anp) to do so. chevron and its partners are cooperating with the brazilian authorities. on july 19, 2012, anp issued its final investigative report on the november 2011 incident. on april 8, 2013, anp approved a plan for partial restoration of production in the frade field, and production under that approved plan commenced on april 30, 2013. a brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuits seeking $10.7 billion in damages for each of the two seeps. on july 31, 2012, a court presiding over the civil litigation entered a preliminary injunction barring chevron from conducting oil production and transportation activities in brazil pending completion of the legal proceedings commenced by the federal district prosecutor and the ongoing proceedings of anp and the brazilian environment and natural resources regulatory agency. on september 28, 2012, the injunction was modified to clarify that chevron may continue its containment and mitigation activities under supervision of anp, and on appeal, the injunction was revoked in its entirety on november 27, 2012. on october 1, 2013, the court dismissed the two civil lawsuits and approved a settlement under which chevron and its consortium partners agreed to spend approximately $43 million on social and environmental programs. the federal district prosecutor also filed criminal charges against eleven chevron employees. on february 19, 2013, the court dismissed the criminal matter, and on appeal, the appellate court reinstated two of the ten allegations, specifically those charges alleging environmental damage and failure to provide timely notification to the authorities. the company’s ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable, but could be significant to net income in any one period.on october 10, 2013, the company finalized a financing agreement dated may 27, 2013 with petroboscan, a joint stock company owned 39.2 percent by chevron, which operates the boscan field in venezuela. the financing, not to exceed $2 billion, will occur in stages over a limited drawdown period set to expire on december 31, 2018. the loan will support a specific work program to maintain and increase production to an agreed-upon level. the terms are designed to support cash needs for ongoing operations and new development, as well as distributions. refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 29 through 32 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by 28table of contentsinventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 29 through 32 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.all other consists of mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, energy services, alternative fuels, and technology companies.operating developmentsnoteworthy operating developments for the upstream business in recent months included the following:•australia — signed binding long-term sales and purchase agreements with tohoku electric power company, inc. for wheatstone lng. binding long-term agreements now cover 85 percent of chevron’s equity lng offtake from wheatstone.•australia — acquired exploration interests in two blocks located in the deepwater bight basin offshore south australia.•canada — successfully concluded the initial twelve-well exploration drilling program in the liquids-rich portion of the duvernay shale. in the downstream business, chevron phillips chemical company llc, the company's 50 percent-owned affiliate, announced a final investment decision on its u.s. gulf coast petrochemicals project. this project will include an ethane cracker with an annual design capacity of 1.5 million metric tons per year and two polyethylene facilities, each with an annual design capacity of 500,000 metric tons per year.the company purchased $1.25 billion of its common stock in third quarter 2013 under its share repurchase program.results of operationsbusiness segments the following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments — upstream and downstream — as well as for “all other.” (refer to note 5, on page 10, for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments,” as defined

approximately $170 million and $40 million, respectively, and higher crude oil production of about $40 million were more than offset by higher depreciation, exploration and operating expenses of about $170 million, $110 million and $60 million, respectively.29table of contentsearnings for the first nine months of 2013 were approximately $3.2 billion, down $728 million from the corresponding period in 2012. earnings decreased due to higher operating, depreciation and exploration expenses of $280 million, $280 million, and $140 million, respectively. higher natural gas realizations of approximately $190 million were mostly offset by lower crude oil realizations of $160 million.the company’s average realization for u.s. crude oil and natural gas liquids in third quarter 2013 was $97 per barrel, compared with $91 a year earlier. for the nine-month periods, average realizations were $95 in 2013 and $97 in 2012. the average natural gas realization in third quarter 2013 was $3.23 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $2.63 in the year-ago period. the average nine-month realizations were $3.37 per thousand cubic feet in 2013 and $2.43 in 2012.net oil-equivalent production of 655,000 barrels per day in third quarter 2013 was up 18,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, from the third quarter a year earlier. net oil-equivalent production of 659,000 barrels per day in the nine-month period increased 10,000 barrels per day from the corresponding 2012 period. production increases in the delaware basin in new mexico and the marcellus shale in western pennsylvania, along with the absence of weather-related downtime in the gulf of mexico were partially offset by normal field declines elsewhere in both comparative periods.the net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 448,000 barrels per day for third quarter 2013 was up 2 percent from the corresponding 2012 period. net liquids production of 452,000 barrels per day in the nine-month period remained unchanged from the 2012 period. net natural gas production was 1.24 billion cubic feet per day in third quarter 2013 and for the first nine months of 2013, an increase of 5 percent from the comparative 2012 periods. three months endedseptember 30 nine months endedseptember 30 2013 2012 2013 2012 (millions of dollars)     international upstream

quarter 2013 increased $49 million from the corresponding period in 2012. the increase between quarters was primarily due to higher volumes and realizations for crude oil of $360 million and $330 million, respectively, largely offset by the absence of a 2012 gain of approximately $600 million from the sale of an equity interest in the wheatstone project, and higher operating expenses of about $110 million in the current period. foreign currency effects decreased earnings by $188 million in the 2013 quarter, compared with a decrease of $252 million a year earlier.earnings for the first nine months of 2013 were $12.7 billion, down $245 million from the same period in 2012. the decrease was mainly due to lower crude oil prices of $450 million, absence of the wheatstone equity sale of $600 million and higher operating expense of $330 million. partially offsetting these effects were lower exploration expenses of $370 million and lower tax items of $330 million. foreign currency effects increased earnings by $259 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared with a decrease of $241 million a year earlier.the average realization per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in third quarter 2013 was $104 compared with $98 a year earlier. for the nine-month periods, average crude oil and natural gas liquids realizations per barrel were $100 and $103 for 2013 and 2012, respectively. the average natural gas realization per thousand cubic feet in third quarter 2013 was $5.88 compared with $6.03 in the corresponding 2012 period. between the nine-month periods, the average natural gas realization was $5.96 per thousand cubic feet, compared to $6.00 in 2012. international net oil-equivalent production of 1.93 million barrels per day in third quarter 2013 was up 51,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, from third quarter a year ago. production increased primarily due to lower maintenance-related downtime at tengizchevroil and project ramp-ups in nigeria and angola, partially offset by normal field declines. international net oil-equivalent production of 1.95 million barrels per day for the nine months of 2013 was essentially flat with the prior year period.30table of contentsthe net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 1.28 million barrels per day in the third quarter 2013 and the first nine months of 2013 increased 2 percent from third quarter 2012 and decreased 2 percent from the first nine months of 2012. net natural gas production totaled 3.91 billion cubic feet per day in third quarter 2013 and 3.98 billion cubic feet per

nine months of 2013 were $522 million compared to $1.7 billion in the corresponding 2012 period. the decrease in both comparative periods was mainly due to lower margins on refined product sales of $160 million and $750 million, respectively. higher operating expenses, mainly reflecting repair and maintenance activities at the company's refineries, also decreased earnings by $160 million and $540 million, respectively. for both periods, the decrease was partially offset by higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned chevron phillips chemical company llc of $90 million and $130 million, respectively.refinery crude-input of 831,000 barrels per day in third quarter 2013 was up 52,000 barrels per day from the corresponding 2012 period. the increase was primarily due to the absence of effects of an august 2012 incident at the refinery in richmond, california that shut down the crude unit, partially offset by planned maintenance activities at the refinery in el segundo, california in the current period. for the first nine months of 2013, crude-input was 742,000 barrels per day, down from 877,000 barrels per day in the corresponding 2012 period. the decline was largely due to the august 2012 incident at the refinery in richmond that shut down the crude unit until april 2013. planned maintenance activities at the el segundo refinery and a planned turnaround at the pascagoula, mississippi refinery also contributed to the decrease.  refined product sales of 1.19 million barrels per day in the third quarter were up 12,000 barrels per day from a year ago, mainly reflecting higher gasoline sales. sales of 1.17 million barrels per day in the nine-month period declined 62,000 barrels per day, mainly due to lower gas oil, kerosene and gasoline sales. branded gasoline sales in the third quarter were up 2 percent to 529,000 barrels per day from a year earlier. for the first nine months, branded gasoline sales were essentially flat with the same period a year ago. three months endedseptember 30 nine months endedseptember 30 2013 2012 2013 2012 (millions of dollars) (millions of dollars)     international downstream

30 2013 2012 2013 2012 (millions of dollars)   income tax expense$3,839 $4,624 $11,068 $15,317effective income tax rates for the 2013 and 2012 quarters were 44 percent and 47 percent, respectively. for the year-to-date period, the effective tax rates were 40 percent and 45 percent for 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate between the quarterly periods primarily resulted from a lower effective tax rate in international upstream operations. the lower international upstream effective tax rate was driven by a lower proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, a greater proportion of equity income in 2013 than in 2012 (equity income is included as part of before-tax income, but is generally recorded net of income taxes), and the effects of non-recurring tax items between periods. these were partially offset by the impact from asset sales on the effective tax rate in the comparative 2012 period. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine-month comparative period was primarily due to lower earnings in higher tax rate international upstream operations, a greater proportion of equity income in 2013 than in 2012, and foreign currency remeasurement impacts.34table of contentsselected operating datathe following table presents a comparison of selected operating data:selected operating data (1)(2)  three months

contentsliquidity and capital resourcescash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled $18.6 billion at september 30, 2013, down $3.3 billion from year-end 2012. cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2013 was $24.6 billion, compared with $26.0 billion in the year-ago period. the decline in the current period primarily reflected lower earnings. cash capital expenditures increased $5.9 billion between periods as work progressed on a number of major capital projects, particularly two australian lng projects and two deepwater gulf of mexico projects. in addition, the company acquired new resource opportunities in australia, the permian basin and the kurdistan region of iraq, along with interests in the kitimat lng project in canada. dividends the company paid dividends of $5.6 billion to common shareholders during the first nine months of 2013. in october 2013, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.00 per common share, payable in december 2013.debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $18.6 billion at september 30, 2013, up from $12.2 billion at december 31, 2012. the $6.4 billion increase in total debt and capital lease obligations in the first nine months of 2013 included a $6 billion bond issuance in june 2013, timed in part to take advantage of historically low interest rates. the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the authorized borrowing limit under this program is $12.0 billion and the outstanding balance at september 30, 2013 was $3.2 billion. the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $6.5 billion at september 30, 2013 and $6.0 billion at december 31, 2012. of these amounts, $6.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at september 30, 2013 and $5.9 billion at december 31, 2012, respectively. at september 30, 2013, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at september 30, 2013, the company had $6.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, expiring in december 2016, which enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at september 30, 2013. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in november 2015 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation, chevron corporation profit sharing/savings plan trust fund and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa by standard and poor’s corporation and aa1 by moody’s investors service. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. the company also can modify capital spending plans during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the company’s high-quality debt ratings.common share repurchase program in july 2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. the company expects to repurchase between $500 million and $2 billion of its common shares per quarter, through open market purchases or in negotiated transactions at 36table of contentsprevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. during third quarter 2013, the company purchased 10.2 million common shares for $1.25 billion. from the inception of the program through third quarter 2013, the company has purchased 129.0 million shares for $13.8 billion.noncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $1.3 billion at september 30, 2013 and december 31, 2012, respectively. distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $93 million during the first nine months of 2013.current ratio — current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. the current ratio was 1.6 at both september 30, 2013 and  december 31, 2012. the current ratio is adversely affected by the fact that chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. at september 30, 2013, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement cost.debt ratio — total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. this ratio was 11.4 percent at september 30, 2013, and 8.2 percent at year-end 2012.pension obligations information related to pension plan contributions is included on pages 14 and 15 in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.capital and exploratory expenditures total expenditures, including the company’s share of spending by affiliates, were $28.9 billion in the first nine months of 2013, compared with $22.7 billion in the corresponding 2012 period. the amounts included the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion in the 2013 and 2012 periods, respectively, which did not require cash outlays by the company. capital expenditures increased between periods as work progressed on a number of major capital projects, particularly two australian lng projects and two deepwater gulf of mexico projects. in addition, the company acquired new resource opportunities in australia, the permian basin and the kurdistan region of iraq, along with interests in the kitimat lng project in canada. expenditures for upstream projects in the first nine months of 2013 were $26.5 billion, representing 92 percent of the company wide total.capital and
