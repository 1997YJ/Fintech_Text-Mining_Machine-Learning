overview

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital economy. our primary component-level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash
memory.

net revenue, gross margin, operating income, and net income for the first quarter of 2009, the
fourth quarter of 2008, and the first quarter of 2008 were as follows:

our first quarter results were impacted by the weak worldwide economy, reduced pc demand, and a
supply chain inventory correction. revenue for the first quarter of 2009 was down 13% from the
fourth quarter of 2008 and 26% from the first quarter of 2008. the sequential decline was larger
than normal seasonal patterns and we experienced declines in all geographic regions. although
revenue declined sequentially for both the mobility group (mg) and digital enterprise group (deg),
the decline in deg was less than the decline in mg due to a shorter overall supply chain for deg
products. as the market adapted to a supply chain inventory correction and demand level
adjustments, the shorter supply chain contributed to more normal order patterns earlier in the
quarter for deg compared to mg. we have executed well in adjusting to these new lower demand levels
and our quarterly results were stronger than anticipated. we have reduced our employees by 1,400 as
we close older generation manufacturing facilities and consolidate assembly and test facilities. we
believe that we have turned the corner from the significant revenue declines of the past two
quarters and established a new baseline, and we expect the industry to return to seasonal patterns
during the second half of 2009. however, there is still significant macroeconomic uncertainty that
could impact demand.

our gross margin for the first quarter was negatively impacted by factory underutilization charges
due to maintaining reduced factory loadings, and start-up costs on our new 32nm process technology.
this reduced level of factory loadings directly contributed to a $699 million reduction in
inventory in the first quarter. we began to increase factory loadings at the end of the first
quarter and as a result we expect factory underutilization charges to be reduced in the second
quarter and positively impact our gross margin. we expect this positive impact to gross margin in
the second quarter to be largely offset by the expected mix of products sales; higher unit costs on
sales of products built in the fourth and first quarter when factories were loaded at lower levels;
and higher start-up costs associated with our new 32nm process technology. the start-up costs
associated with the 32nm process technology should decline in the second half of 2009 as we expect
to begin shipping the first products based on the 32nm process technology later in 2009.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our tax rate decreased from prior periods due to the first quarter settlement of various federal
and state tax matters related to prior years and as a result of a higher percentage of our profits
coming from lower tax jurisdictions. we expect the concentration of profits in lower tax
jurisdictions to continue in 2009 and expect our tax rate to be approximately 24% for the second,
third, and fourth quarters of 2009.

our product lineup is extremely well positioned across the spectrum of computing. in the first
quarter we extended our competitive advantage in the enterprise market segment with the release of
the intel® xeontm processor 5500 series (part of our nehalam family of
processors). this family of products represents the largest increase in server performance from one
generation to the next. although the server business remains a challenge in the near term, we
believe this family of products provides a strong value proposition for enterprise customers as it
can lower the cost of computing while increasing performance.

from a financial condition perspective, we ended the first quarter of 2009 with an investment
portfolio valued at $12.8 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments
included in trading assets, and short- and long-term investments. the credit quality of our
investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment, with
other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to $7 million
in the first quarter of 2009 and $51 million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008. in addition,
we continue to be able to invest in high-quality investments. however, we have seen a reduction in
the volume of available commercial paper from certain market segments. as a result, our investments
in short-term government funds have increased, which will reduce our average investment return.
despite the continued tightness of the credit markets, we continue to be able to access funds
through the credit markets, including through the issuance of commercial paper. with the exception
of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments,
we have not seen significant liquidation delays, and for those that have matured we have received
the full par value of our original debt investments. for additional details on our investment
portfolio, see “liquidity and capital resources.”

during the first quarter of 2009, we paid $779 million to stockholders as dividends, and in march,
our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.14 per common share to be paid in june.

strategy

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital economy. as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use
our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our
financial resources, global presence, and brand recognition. we believe that we have the scale,
capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly.

some of our key focus areas are listed below:



 
•
 
customer orientation. our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products
based on the needs and expectations of our customers. in turn, our products help enable the
design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers.
we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work
together to provide an optimized user computing solution, compared to components that are
used separately.


 
•
 
architecture and platforms. we are developing integrated platform solutions by moving
the memory controller and graphics functionality from the chipset to the microprocessor.
this platform repartitioning is designed to provide improved performance due to higher
integration, lower power consumption, and reduced platform size. in addition, we are
focusing on improved energy-efficient performance for computing and communications systems
and devices. improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing improved performance
with lower power consumption. we continue to develop multi-core microprocessors with an
increasing number of cores, which enable improved multitasking and energy efficiency. we
are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many-core architecture aimed
at parallel processing. this architecture will initially be used in developing discrete
graphics processors designed for gaming and media creation. over time, this architecture
may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations
as well as high-performance computing applications.


 
•
 
silicon and manufacturing technology leadership. our strategy for developing
microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new
microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. we plan to introduce a
new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon
process technology in the intervening years. this coordinated schedule allows us to develop
and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for
the next generation of silicon process technology. we refer to this as our “tick-tock”
technology development cadence.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)



 
•
 
strategic investments. we make equity investments in companies around the world that we
believe will generate returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business
initiatives. our investments, including those made through our intel capital program,
generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital
economy, create new business opportunities for intel, and expand global markets for our
products. our current investments focus on the following areas: advancing flash memory
products, enabling mobile wireless devices, advancing the digital home, enhancing the digital
enterprise, advancing high-performance communications infrastructures, and developing the
next generation of silicon process technologies. our focus areas and investment activities
tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in
the economic climate.


 
•
 
business environment and software. we believe that we are well positioned in the
technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote industry
standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. we plan to
continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer products
that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. we frequently participate
in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and
other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting
organizations. in addition, we work collaboratively with other companies to protect digital
content and the consumer. lastly, through our software and services group (ssg), we help
enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to
help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take
advantage of our platforms.


we believe that the proliferation of the internet, including user demand for premium content and
rich media, drives the need for greater performance in pcs and servers. a growing number of older
pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users demand, such as streaming video,
uploading photos, and online gaming. as these tasks become even more demanding and require more
computing power, we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks
on the internet. we also believe that increased internet traffic creates a need for greater server
infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance.

while in the first quarter of 2009 sales declined more significantly for mg versus deg, we believe
that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor
units will eventually resume. we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in
the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power
microprocessors.

our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors
for new uses and form factors. we believe that these low-power microprocessors give us the ability
to extend intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including a growing number of
products that require processors specifically designed for embedded solutions, mobile internet
devices (mids), consumer electronics devices, nettops, and netbooks. we believe that the common
elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to
access the internet.

to meet the demands of new and evolving mobile markets segments, we also offer, and are continuing
to develop, system on chip (soc) products that integrate core processing functionality with
specific components, such as graphics, audio, and video, onto a single chip to form a purpose-built
solution. this integration reduces cost, power consumption, and size. in the first quarter of 2009,
we announced plans to collaborate with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, ltd. (tsmc), a
large semiconductor foundry, in an effort to broaden the market opportunities for intel®
atomtm processors in soc products by integrating our intel atom processor cores
with tsmc’s process technology platform.

strategy by operating segment

the strategy for our digital enterprise group (deg) is to offer computing and communications
products for businesses, service providers, and consumers. deg products are incorporated into
desktop and nettop computers, enterprise computer servers and workstations, and products that make
up the infrastructure for the internet. we also offer products for embedded designs, such as
industrial equipment, point-of-sale systems, telecommunications, panel pcs, in-vehicle
information/entertainment systems, and medical equipment. our strategy for the desktop computing
market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and
energy-efficient performance while at the same time lowering total cost of ownership for
businesses. for consumers in the desktop computing market segment, we also focus on the design of
components for high-end enthusiast pcs and mainstream pcs with rich audio and video capabilities.
our strategy for the nettop computing market segment is to offer products that enable affordable,
internet-focused devices with small form factors. our strategy for the enterprise computing market
segment is to offer products that provide energy-efficient performance and virtualization
technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. we are also increasing our focus on
products designed for high-performance computing, data centers, and blade server systems. our
strategy for the embedded computing market segment is to drive intel architecture as an embedded
solution by delivering long life cycle support, architectural scalability, and platform
integration.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

the strategy for our mobility group is to offer notebook pc products designed to improve
performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of
smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. we are also increasing our focus on products designed
for the business and consumer environments by offering technologies that provide increased
manageability and security, and we continue to invest in the build-out of wimax. we also offer, and
are continuing to develop, products that enable mobile devices to deliver digital content and the
internet to users in new ways, including products for mids and netbooks.

the strategy for our nand solutions group is to offer advanced nand flash memory products, focusing
on system-level solutions for intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives.
additionally, we offer nand products used in memory cards. in support of our strategy to provide
advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development of innovative products
designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non-volatile, low-cost, high-density
memory.

the strategy for our digital home group is to offer products and solutions, including soc designs,
for use in consumer electronics devices designed to access and share internet, broadcast, optical
media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home. we are
focusing on the design of components for consumer electronics devices, such as digital tvs,
high-definition media players, and set-top boxes, which receive, decode, and convert incoming data
signals.

the strategy for our digital health group is to design and deliver technology-enabled products and
explore global business opportunities in healthcare information technology and healthcare research,
as well as personal healthcare. in support of this strategy, we are focusing on the design of
technology solutions and platforms for the digital hospital and consumer/home health products.

the strategy for our software and services group is to promote intel architecture as the platform
of choice for software and services. ssg works with the worldwide software and services ecosystem
by providing software products, engaging with developers, and driving strategic software
investments.

critical accounting estimates

the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. some of our
accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the
need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical
accounting estimates include:



 
•
 
the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments,
net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;


 
•
 
the valuation of investments in debt instruments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact our investment portfolio balance when we
assess fair value, and interest and other, net when we record impairments of
available-for-sale debt instruments;


 
•
 
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which primarily impacts gross
margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their
depreciation;


 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the
measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and


 
•
 
the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin.


below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. we also
have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as those for revenue
recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors; however, these policies
typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

non-marketable equity investments

the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives,
totaled $3.8 billion as of march 28, 2009 ($4.1 billion as of december 27, 2008). the majority of
this balance as of march 28, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment.
our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies, llc
(imft) of $1.6 billion ($1.7 billion as of december 27, 2008), our investment in im flash
singapore, llp (imfs) of $316 million ($329 million as of december 27, 2008), and our investment in
numonyx b.v. of $461 million ($484 million as of december 27, 2008). in addition, we regularly
invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage
companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with
established revenue streams and business models. for additional information, see “note 8: equity
method investments” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

32



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method
of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable
equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance
sheets.

non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of the companies in which we
invest are likely to fail. their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance,
operational efficiency, and other key business factors. depending on their future prospects, the
companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive
lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our
investments would likely become impaired. additionally, the current financial markets are extremely
volatile and there has been a tightening of the credit markets, which could negatively affect the
prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the
likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as
initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. for further information about our investment
portfolio risks, including those specific to our investments in the flash memory market segment, see “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q.

we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment. for non-marketable equity
investments, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or
circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment. the indicators that
we use to identify those events or circumstances primarily include:



 
•
 
the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall
business prospects;


 
•
 
the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;


 
•
 
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including
adverse regulatory or economic changes;


 
•
 
factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the investee’s
liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and


 
•
 
the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.


investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis
to determine if the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value. if the fair value of
the investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other than
temporarily impaired based on the severity and duration of the impairment. if the investment is
considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value.
the assessment of fair value for non-marketable investments is based on the provisions of statement
of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 157, “fair value measurements” (sfas no. 157), as
amended. with the exception of clearwire communications, llc (clearwire llc), the fair value of our
non-marketable investments are classified as level 3 when impaired, as we use unobservable inputs
to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement, and the valuation
requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of
liquidity. if impaired, the fair value of our investment in clearwire llc would be classified as
level 2, as the unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology are not significant to the fair
value measurement.

impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $79 million in the first quarter of 2009.
over the past 12 quarters, including the first quarter of 2009, impairments of non-marketable
equity investments have ranged from $10 million to $896 million per quarter. this range includes
impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, which were primarily related to a
$762 million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire llc.

the following is a discussion of the methods, estimates, and judgments that management uses in our
analysis to determine if our non-marketable equity investments are other than temporarily impaired.

imft/imfs

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand
products to intel and micron technology, inc. at manufacturing cost. our nand solutions group
operating segment purchases 49% of these nand products from imft and sells them to our customers.
as a result, we generate cash flows from our investments in imft, imfs, and our intangible assets
related to the nand product designs through our nand solutions group business. therefore, we
determine the fair value of our investments in imft and imfs using the income approach, based on a
weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business.

33



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

the discounted cash flow scenarios require the use of unobservable inputs, including assumptions of
projected revenues (including product volume, product mix, and average selling prices), expenses,
capital spending, and other costs, as well as a discount rate. estimates of projected revenues,
expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by imft, imfs, and intel using historical
data and available market data. management also determines how multiple discounted cash flow
scenarios are weighted in the fair value determination. additionally, the development of several
inputs used in our income model (such as discount rate) requires the selection of comparable
companies within the nand flash memory market segment. the selection of comparable companies
requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including nand products and
services lines within the flash memory market segment, comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates,
and other relevant factors.

changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs would change the fair value of the
investment. the estimates for the projected revenue and discount rate are the assumptions that most
significantly affect the fair value determination. we did not have an other-than-temporary
impairment on our investments in imft and imfs in the first quarters of 2009 and 2008. it is
reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the
near term and result in an impairment of our investment.

numonyx

we determine the fair value of our investment in numonyx using a combination of the income approach
and the market approach. the income approach includes the use of a weighted average of multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios of numonyx, which requires the use of unobservable inputs, including
assumptions of projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs, as well as a
discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment. estimates of
projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by numonyx and intel.
the market approach includes using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies,
such as projected revenues, expenses, and other costs. the selection of comparable companies used
in the market approach requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including
nor products and services lines within the flash memory market segment, comparable companies’
sizes, growth rates, and other relevant factors.

changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs in our valuation models would change the
fair value of the investment. the estimated projected revenue is the assumption that most
significantly affects the fair value determination. management judgment is also involved in
determining how the income approach and the market approach are weighted in the fair value
determination. we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in numonyx in
the first quarter of 2009. it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value
determination could change in the near term and result in an impairment of our investment.

other non-marketable equity investments

we determine the fair value of these non-marketable equity investments using the market approach
and/or the income approach. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of
comparable public companies. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and
is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, products and
services lines, development stage, and other relevant factors. the income approach includes the use
of a discounted cash flow model, which requires the following significant estimates for the
investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; estimated
costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. estimates
of market segment size, market segment share, and costs are developed by the investee and/or intel
using historical data and available market data. the valuation of our other non-marketable
investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets, recent
financing activities by the investees, changes in the interest rate environment, the investee’s
capital structure, liquidation preferences for the investee’s capital, and other economic
variables.

investments in debt instruments

fair value

in the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be
difficult and subjective. the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined,
and the rapid changes occurring in today’s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value
of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time. sfas no. 157 establishes three levels
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to
consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q). each level of input has different
levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value.

34



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

level 1 instruments represent quoted prices in active markets. therefore, determining fair value
for level 1 instruments does not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not
difficult.

level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for
identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active
markets), issuer credit ratings, non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with
observable market data, model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or
can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities, or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. these
level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level 1
instruments, including:



 
•
 
determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced requires
management to identify a sample of similar securities based on the coupon rates, maturity,
issuer, credit rating, and instrument type, and subjectively select an individual security
or multiple securities that are deemed most similar to the security being priced.


 
•
 
determining whether a market is considered active requires management judgment. our
assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into
consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date
of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument
trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of
the issued instrument.


 
•
 
determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining fair value requires
management judgment. when observable market prices for identical securities or similar
securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding
market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data or pricing
models, such as discounted cash flow models, with all significant inputs derived from or
corroborated with observable market data.


level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant
to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. the determination of fair value for
level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. most of our marketable
debt instruments classified as level 3 are valued using a non-binding market consensus price or a
non-binding broker quote, both of which we corroborate with unobservable data. non-binding market
consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers.
these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker
quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and the internal
assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs, and to a lesser
degree non-observable market inputs. adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using
non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes, and classified as level 3, were
not significant in the first quarter of 2009.

other-than-temporary impairment

after determining the fair value of our available-for-sale debt instruments, gains or losses on
these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the investment is sold
or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. determining whether the decline
in fair value is other-than-temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and
circumstances of each investment. for investments in debt instruments, these judgments primarily
consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer, the issuer’s credit rating, and any
specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid
in full; and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity. given the current market
conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit
ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.

as of march 28, 2009, our investments included $10.1 billion of available-for-sale debt
instruments. during the first quarter of 2009, we recognized $7 million in other-than-temporary
impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments ($51 million cumulatively since the
beginning of 2008). as of march 28, 2009, our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt
instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $230 million (approximately $215
million as of december 27, 2008). as of march 28, 2009, this amount included approximately $180
million of unrecognized losses that could be recognized in the future if our other-than-temporary
assessment changes.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

long-lived assets

we assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. factors that we
consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of
a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic
trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. we measure the
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying
value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash
flows. if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted
cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is measured by
comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value, based on
the best information available, including use of the market approach or the income approach,
including the use of discounted cash flow models. long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible
assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are carried at
fair value only when an impairment charge is recorded.

impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of
identifiable independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of
our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the
independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective
judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor
manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the
assets’ new, shorter useful lives. over the past 12 quarters, including the first quarter of 2009,
impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $15 million to $320
million per quarter. for further discussion on asset impairment charges, see “note 13:
restructuring and asset impairment charges” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q.

income taxes

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial
statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits,
benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise
from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial
statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision
in a subsequent period.

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery
is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we
will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated
condensed balance sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred
tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery
was not likely. changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments
could affect our future provision for taxes.

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we
determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step
requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to
estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we
reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors
including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively
settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement
would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

inventory

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
inventory that is not of saleable quality. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory
requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. the estimate of future demand is
compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. as of march 28, 2009, we had total work-in-process inventory of
$1,448 million and total finished goods inventory of $1,217 million. the demand forecast is
included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between
inventory valuation and build decisions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the
inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life
cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an
assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. if our demand forecast for
specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output
accordingly, or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately, we could be required to write off
inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

our net revenue for q1 2009 was $7.1 billion, a decrease of 26% compared to q1 2008. the decrease
was primarily due to lower unit sales of microprocessors and chipsets. revenue from the sale of nor
flash memory products and communications products declined approximately $400 million, primarily as
a result of the divestiture of these businesses. revenue in all four geographic regions declined
significantly.

our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2009 were $3.2 billion, a decrease of $2.0 billion, or 38%,
compared to q1 2008. our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 45.3% in q1 2009, from 53.8%
in q1 2008. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin
percentage decrease in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments. this was
partially offset by the positive impact on gross margin due to the divestiture of our nor flash
memory business. we derived substantially all of our overall gross margin dollars and operating
profit in q1 2009 and q1 2008 from the sales of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and
mobility group operating segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin
expectations.

digital enterprise group

the revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group (deg) operating segment for q1
2009 and q1 2008 were as follows:

net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased by $1.4 billion, or 26%, in q1 2009 compared to
q1 2008. microprocessors within deg include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise
computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors. the decrease in microprocessor
revenue was primarily due to lower enterprise and desktop unit sales. higher enterprise average
selling prices were partially offset by lower desktop average selling prices. the decrease in
chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset and motherboard unit
sales and lower revenue from the sale of communications products.

operating income decreased by $1.1 billion, or 60%, in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008. the decrease in
operating income was primarily due to the lower revenue. in addition, during the first quarter of
2009 we recorded approximately $250 million of factory underutilization charges, primarily relating
to chipsets and microprocessors. this was partially offset by lower microprocessor unit costs.

mobility group

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group (mg) operating segment for q1 2009 and q1
2008 were as follows:

net revenue for the mg operating segment decreased by $755 million, or 21%, in q1 2009 compared to
q1 2008. the decrease in microprocessor revenue was due to lower microprocessor average selling
prices and lower microprocessor unit sales. the lower average selling prices were due to the
increase in unit sales of intel atom processors. the decrease in chipset and other revenue was
primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products and lower chipset
unit sales.

operating income decreased by $922 million, or 79%, in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008. the decrease
was primarily due to lower microprocessor revenue. in addition, during the first quarter of 2009 we
recorded approximately $420 million of factory underutilization charges, primarily related to
microprocessors and chipsets. this was partially offset by lower microprocessor unit costs.

research and development. r&d spending decreased $150 million, or 10%, in q1 2009 compared to q1
2008. this decrease was primarily due to lower process development costs as we transition from
research and development to manufacturing using our 32nm manufacturing process technology, and to a
lesser extent, lower profit-dependent compensation.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased
$149 million, or 11%, in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008. this decrease was primarily due to lower
advertising expenses, including lower cooperative advertising expenses, and to a lesser extent,
lower profit-dependent compensation.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 35% of net revenue in q1
2009 (29% of net revenue in q1 2008).

we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit

2009 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of $115 million.

2009 restructuring program

in the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing
and assembly and test operations, and align our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity to
current market conditions. these actions have included closing two assembly and test facilities in
malaysia, one facility in the philippines, and one facility in china; stopping production at a
200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication
facility in california. restructuring and asset impairment charges were as follows:

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment
charges. these charges include $54 million that relate to employee severance and benefit
arrangements for approximately 5,400 employees, of which 100 employees have
left the company as of march 28, 2009. most of these employee actions occurred within
manufacturing. the remaining accrual as of march 28, 2009 was
related to severance benefits that are recorded within accrued compensation and benefits.

we estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings
of approximately $240 million. the substantial majority of these savings will be realized within
cost of sales.

2006 efficiency program

in the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan
designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. restructuring and asset
impairment charges were as follows:

during q1 2008, we incurred $275 million in additional asset impairment charges related to assets
that we sold in q2 2008 in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business. we
determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable
that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs. the lower fair value was
primarily a result of a decline in the outlook for the flash memory market segment. we had
previously incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges in 2007 related to assets that we sold
in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business. we determined the impairment
charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of
the divestiture.

recorded within accrued compensation and benefits.

from q3 2006 through q1 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset
impairment charges related to this plan. these charges included a total of $683 million related to
employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 11,300 employees, of which 10,900
employees had left the company as of march 28, 2009. a substantial majority of these employee
actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. we paid
$648 million of the employee severance and benefit charges incurred as of march 28, 2009. the
restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset impairment charges.

net losses on equity method investments were $72 million in q1 2009 compared to $52 million in q1
2008. we recognized higher equity method losses and higher impairment charges in q1 2009 compared
to q1 2008. our equity method losses include losses related to numonyx ($23 million in q1 2009) and

recognized lower interest income and lower gains on divestitures (none in q1 2009 and $39 million
in q1 2008) in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008. these decreases were partially offset by approximately
$25 million of fair value gains in q1 2009 on our trading assets, compared to approximately $60
million of fair value losses in q1 2008. interest income was lower in q1 2009 compared to q1 2008
as a result of lower interest rates and, to a lesser extent, lower average investment balances.

provision for taxes

our effective income tax rate for q1 2009 was zero compared to 33.5% in q1 2008. our estimated
annual effective tax rate in q1 2009 was 9.8% lower than the estimated annual effective tax rate in
q1 2008, primarily as a result of a higher percentage of profits in lower tax jurisdictions. the
impact of discrete items in q1 2009 reduced our effective tax rate by 23.7% compared to the impact
of discrete items of q1 2008, primarily due to the q1 2009 settlement of various federal and state
matters related to prior years.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

the current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict
product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could
differ materially from our expectations. in addition to the various important factors discussed
above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations. see the risks described in “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q. in
our april 14, 2009 earnings release we stated that we were not providing a revenue forecast as part
of our business outlook, but we indicated at that time that for our internal purposes, we were
planning for revenue to be approximately flat to the first quarter. our revenue plan is a statement
made as of april 14, 2009, is not a part of business outlook, and is not subject to updating by the
company in the period prior to the “quiet period.”

our expectations for the remainder of 2009 are as follows:



 
q2 2009


 
•
 
gross margin percentage: expected to be in the mid-40s.


 
•
 
depreciation: approximately $1.2 billion.


 
•
 
total spending (research and development plus marketing, general and administrative
expenses): approximately flat compared to the first quarter of 2009 of $2.5 billion.


 
•
 
restructuring and asset impairment charges: approximately $115 million.


 
•
 
net gains (losses) from equity investments and interest and other: net loss of
approximately $150 million.




 
full year 2009


 
•
 
capital spending: slightly down from 2008 of $5.2 billion.


 
•
 
depreciation: approximately $4.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million.


 
•
 
total spending (research and development plus marketing, general and administrative
expenses): between $10.4 billion and 10.6 billion.


 
•
 
tax rate: approximately 24% for the second, third, and fourth quarters. the estimated
effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of march 28, 2009 and current expected
income.


status of business outlook

we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with
investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking
statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q, including
any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. at the same time, we will
keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor
relations web site at www.intc.com. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook
published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we
publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the “business outlook” and other
forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year
in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times.

from the close of business on may 29, 2009 until our quarterly earnings release is published,
presently scheduled for july 14, 2009, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet period,
the “business outlook” and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed
on april 14, 2009, as reiterated or updated as applicable, in this form 10-q, should be considered
historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the
quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results
or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we
utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes
in assets and liabilities.

cash from operations for the first quarter of 2009 was $378
million, a decrease of $1.8 billion compared to the first quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower
net income and changes in our working capital such as lower accounts payable and lower income
taxes payable, partially offset by lower inventories.

inventories as of march 28, 2009 decreased compared to december 27, 2008, due to lower
microprocessor, chipset, and raw material inventories. accounts payable as of march 28, 2009
decreased compared to december 27, 2008 on lower production spending. accrued compensation and
benefits liabilities decreased compared to december 27, 2008 primarily due to the payout of 2008
year-end profit dependent compensation during the first quarter of 2009.

as of march, 28, 2009, our other accrued liabilities included $264 million in customer credit
balances ($447 million as of december 27, 2008). accounts receivable as of march 28, 2009 increased
compared to december 27, 2008, despite decreased revenue, due to a higher proportion of sales
occurring at the end of the first quarter of 2009. for the first quarter of 2009, our two largest
customers accounted for 40% of net revenue (38% for the first quarter of 2008) with one of those
customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue, and another customer accounting for 19% of our net
revenue. these two largest customers accounted for 40% of net accounts receivable at march 28, 2009
(46% at december 27, 2008).

investing activities

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases,
maturities, and disposals.

in the first quarter of 2009, our investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of $409
million compared to a net cash outflow of $921 million in the first quarter of 2008. this was
driven primarily by a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments which was
partially offset by an increase in capital spending.

financing activities

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock, payment of
dividends to stockholders, and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive
plans.

the decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the
first quarter of 2008, was primarily due to the absence of repurchases and retirement of common
stock during the first quarter of 2009. in the first quarter of 2008, we repurchased 121.9 million
shares of common stock at a cost of $2.5 billion. as of march 28, 2009, $7.4 billion remained
available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. we base our
level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. our
dividend payment was $779 million in the first quarter of 2009, slightly higher than the $739
million paid in the first quarter of 2008. proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee
equity incentive plans totaled $247 million for the first quarter of 2009 compared to $468 million
for the first quarter of 2008, as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock
options.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

liquidity

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. as of march 28, 2009, we
also had an investment portfolio valued at $12.8 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents,
debt instruments included in trading assets, and short- and long-term investments.

our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities at the time of investment
of up to 6 months to be rated at least a-1/p-1 by standard & poor’s/moody’s, and specifies a higher
minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. for instance, investments with maturities of
greater than three years require a minimum rating of aa-/aa3 at the time of investment. government
regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-u.s. subsidiaries, or the absence of a
rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. substantially all of
our investments in debt instruments are with a/a2 or better rated issuers, and the majority of the
issuers are rated aa-/aa2 or better. additionally, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any
one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty’s relative credit standing. as of march
28, 2009, the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $500 million.

credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. the
amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the
amounts, if any, by which a counterparty’s obligations exceed our obligations with that
counterparty, because we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible
to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions subject to international swaps and derivatives
association, inc. (isda) agreements.

the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit
environment, with other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments
limited to $7 million in the first quarter of 2009 and $51 million cumulatively since the beginning
of 2008. in addition, we continue to be able to invest in high-quality investments. however, we
have seen a reduction in the volume of available commercial paper from certain market segments. as
a result, our investments in short-term government funds have increased, which has reduced our
average investment return. with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have
recognized other-than-temporary impairments, we have not seen significant liquidation delays, and
for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments.
we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the
principal amounts invested, which may occur at or near the maturity of those investments.

as of march 28, 2009, $8.8 billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than one year.
as of march 28, 2009, our cumulative unrealized losses, net of corresponding hedging activities,
related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were approximately $120 million
(approximately $145 million as of december 27, 2008). as of march 28, 2009, our cumulative
unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately
$230 million (approximately $215 million as of december 27, 2008). substantially all of our
unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment
that resulted in a decrease in the market liquidity for debt instruments.

we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate
exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors. we intend to continue
to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our
investment policy as deemed necessary. based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio
and our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result
of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations.

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing
authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the
issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the
first quarter of 2009 were approximately $610 million, although no commercial paper remained
outstanding as of march 28, 2009. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1
by moody’s as of march 28, 2009. despite the tightening of the credit markets, we continue to be
able to access funds through the credit markets, including through the issuance of commercial
paper. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to
which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next
12 months, including capital expenditures for manufacturing
and assembly and test, working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock
repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

fair value of financial instruments

the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the provisions of sfas no.
157. sfas no. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. observable
inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas
unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset
or liability. a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at
fair value on a recurring basis. when fair value is determined using observable market prices, the
credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument. when fair value is
determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk
and/or intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate.
during the first quarter of 2009, the valuation of our liabilities measured and recorded at fair
value as well as our derivative instruments in a current or potential net liability position were
not impacted by changes in our credit risk. the credit ratings of certain counterparties have
deteriorated. however, the deterioration of these credit ratings did not have a significant impact
on the valuation of either our marketable debt instruments or derivative instruments in a current
or potential net asset position.

when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of
the instruments being measured, we classify those instruments as level 3 under the sfas no. 157
hierarchy. as of march 28, 2009, our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis included $13.4 billion of assets, of which $1.2 billion (9%) were classified as
level 3. in addition, our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $382 million of liabilities, of which $165 million (43%) were classified as level 3.
during the first quarter of 2009, we transferred approximately $260 million of assets from level 3
to level 2. these assets primarily consisted of floating-rate notes that were transferred from
level 3 to level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and/or non-binding
market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of our instruments. during the first
quarter of 2009, we recognized an insignificant amount of losses on the assets that were
transferred from level 3 to level 2.

during the first quarter of 2009, the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded
at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value gains totaling $15
million. of this amount, gains of $36 million were recognized in our consolidated condensed
statements of income and losses of $21 million were included in other comprehensive income. we
believe the losses included in other comprehensive income represent a temporary decline in the fair
value of available-for-sale investments. during the first quarter of 2009, we did not experience
any significant realized gains (losses) related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our
portfolio.

marketable debt instruments

as of march 28, 2009, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included
$12.6 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, approximately $1.0 billion was
classified as level 1, approximately $10.4 billion as level 2, and approximately $1.2 billion as
level 3.

when available, we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable
debt instruments. if observable market prices are not available, we use non-binding market
consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data, if available, or
non-observable market data. when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument,
we use observable market quotes to price our instruments, in lieu of prices from other sources.

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable
market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. marketable debt
instruments in this category generally include certain of our floating-rate notes, corporate bonds,
and money market fund deposits. management judgment was required to determine our policy that
defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to
be considered active. our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments
generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the
valuation date of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual
instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount
of the issued instrument.

45



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

approximately 10% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at
fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage
of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. when
observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt
instruments using: non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market
data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash
flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.
non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing
providers or brokers. these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding
and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and
the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a
lesser degree non-observable market inputs. we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices
with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exist. the
discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as libor-based yield curves,
currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. approximately 50% of our balance of marketable
debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified
as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are
corroborated with observable market data and approximately 40% due to the usage of a discounted
cash flow model. marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 generally include commercial
paper, bank time deposits, municipal bonds, certain of our money market fund deposits and
corporate bonds, and a
majority of floating-rate notes.



our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to
corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when
observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and
non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. marketable debt instruments in
this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our floating-rate notes and
corporate bonds. all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3, and
substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not
able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for
asset-backed securities.

equity securities

as of march 28, 2009, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $412 million of marketable equity securities. of these securities, $392 million was
classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities
in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities
generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the
valuation date for each individual security, including the number of days each individual equity
security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares
of that security. the fair values of our investments in clearwire corporation ($183 million) and
vmware, inc. ($130 million) constituted the substantial majority of the fair values of the
marketable equity securities that we classified as level 1. the remaining marketable equity
securities ($20 million) were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on
quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific
restrictions.

as of march 28, 2009, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $286 million of equity securities offsetting deferred compensation. all of these
securities were classified as level 1, because their valuations were based on quoted prices for
identical securities in active markets.
