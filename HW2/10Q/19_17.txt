quarter of fiscal 2013, we reported net earnings of $1.2 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.83 compared to net earnings of $1.0 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.68 for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.  net sales increased 7.4% to $19.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 from $17.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, the first quarter of fiscal 2013 benefited from a seasonal timing change that added approximately $574 million, or approximately 320 basis points, of growth to net sales. our comparable store sales increased 4.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, driven by a 4.2% increase in our comparable store average ticket and a 0.1% increase in our comparable store customer transactions. comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 4.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives:customer service – our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first and simplifying the business. we continue to work toward and expect to achieve our goal of having 60% of our store labor hours dedicated to customer-facing activity by the end of fiscal 2013.product authority – our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering innovation, assortment and value. as part of this effort, we introduced innovative new products and great values for both our professional and do-it-yourself customers in a variety of departments.disciplined capital allocation, productivity and efficiency – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement, incremental supply chain benefits, disciplined capital allocation and expense control and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. our inventory turnover ratio was 4.4 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 4.3 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012. during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. we received an initial delivery of approximately 18 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 under the $1.5 billion asr agreement. we also repurchased approximately 9 million additional shares through the open market during the first quarter of fiscal 2013.11table of contentsinterconnected retail – our focus on interconnected retail is based on building a competitive platform across all commerce channels. during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed the roll out of buy online, ship to store ("boss"), which allows customers access to over 300,000 items available for pickup in our stores. we also continued to improve the shopping experience for our customers by simplifying our online checkout process and implementing electronic receipts on our website, on our mobile applications and in our stores. we opened one new store in mexico during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, for a total store count of 2,257 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013, a total of 281 of our stores, or 12.5%, were located in canada and mexico.we generated $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. this cash flow, along with $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, was used in part to fund $2.2 billion of share repurchases, pay $577 million of dividends and fund $278 million in capital expenditures.our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 17.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 15.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.12table of contentswe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. % of net sales   three months ended   may 5, 2013 april 29,

billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. the increase in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales and the benefit from a seasonal timing change. total comparable store sales increased 4.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to an increase of 5.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, the first quarter of fiscal 2013 included one additional week of spring, and this seasonal timing change added approximately $574 million, or approximately 320 basis points, of growth to net sales.the positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives and an improved u.s. housing market. all of our departments except two posted positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, and comparable store average ticket increased 4.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. comparable store sales for our kitchen, lumber, tools, plumbing, décor, electrical, bath, flooring, lighting and hardware product categories were above the company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. comparable store sales for our paint, millwork and building materials product categories were positive for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. comparable store sales for our indoor garden and outdoor garden product categories were negative for the first quarter of 2013, reflecting the impact of cooler weather and difficult year-over-year comparisons due to last year's unusually warm spring weather.gross profit increased 8.0% to $6.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 from $6.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 34.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, an increase of 20 basis points. the increase in gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by our recently acquired businesses, which are gross margin accretive, and improved shrink performance partially offset by a change in mix of products sold. selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 2.4% to $4.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 from $4.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 21.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 22.9% for the same period last year. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of sales reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls.depreciation and amortization increased 5.0% to $402 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 from $383 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 2.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 2.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment offset by higher depreciation related to our capital expenditures in recent years being more heavily weighted toward technology assets that have shorter depreciable lives.operating income increased 22.2% to $2.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 from $1.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. operating income as a percent of net sales was 10.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 9.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we recognized $161 million of interest and other, net, compared to $84 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 0.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. interest and other, net, for the first quarter of 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of hd supply, inc.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 36.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.diluted earnings per share were $0.83 for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to $0.68 for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 reflect $0.03 of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended may 5, 2013.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion compared to $2.5 billion for the same period of fiscal 2012. this increase is primarily due to a $191 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls. the amount of cash flow generated in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 from working capital and other, including merchandise inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses, was consistent with the same period last year.14table of contentsnet cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $276 million compared to $221 million for the same period of fiscal 2012. this change was primarily due to a $50 million increase in capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the same period last year.net cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $589 million compared to $1.1 billion for the same period of fiscal 2012. this change was primarily the result of $2.0 billion in net proceeds from long-term borrowings, partially offset by $1.1 billion more in repurchases of common stock and $348 million less in proceeds from the sale of common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2012.in april 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.70% senior notes due april 1, 2023 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 4.20% senior notes due april 1, 2043 at a discount of $4 million (together, the "april 2013 issuance"). interest on these senior notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2013. the net proceeds of the april 2013 issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.5 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 18 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.5 billion asr agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement.in the the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 9 million additional shares of our common stock for $650 million through the open market. as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013, $14.9 billion remained under the $17.0 billion share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in february 2013. we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. as of may 5, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. the credit facility expires in july 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. as of may 5, 2013, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.as of may 5, 2013, we had $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.15table of contents
