reported segments are described below:•google – google includes our main internet products such as search, ads, commerce, maps, youtube, apps, cloud, android, chrome, google play as well as hardware products we sell, such as chromecast, chromebooks and nexus. our technical infrastructure and newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in google. google generates revenues primarily from advertising, sales of digital content, apps and cloud offerings for enterprise, as well as sales of google branded hardware.•other bets – other bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. other bets includes businesses such as access/google fiber, calico, nest, verily, gv, google capital, x, and other initiatives. revenues from the other bets are

regarding the number of "paid clicks" and "cost-per-click" for our google websites and google network members websites. management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.paid clicks for our google websites represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including gmail, finance, maps, and google play; and viewed youtube engagement ads like trueview (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad). paid clicks for our google network members' websites include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on google network members' properties participating in our adsense for search, adsense for content and admob businesses. in some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our revenue base. cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenue divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average cost we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.the rate of change in revenue and revenue growth, as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google websites and google network members' websites and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including:30table of contentsalphabet inc.•growth rates of our revenues from google websites, including youtube, compared to those of our revenues from google network members' websites;•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•seasonality;•the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;•a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenue generated in google websites and google network members' websites, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and•general economic conditions.our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.google websitesthe following table presents our google websites revenues (in millions) and changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage) for the periods presented: three months

websites revenues consist primarily of:•adwords revenue that is generated on google.com. this includes revenue from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.;•advertising revenue generated on youtube, including, but not limited to youtube trueview and google preferred; and•advertising revenue generated from other google owned and operated properties like gmail, finance, maps, and google play.our google websites revenues increased $2,396 million from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 and also increased as a percentage of google segment revenues. our google websites revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search due to ongoing improvements in ad formats and delivery, growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as growth in youtube video advertising across trueview and google preferred, with a growing contribution from app promotions, partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs increased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 due to growth in the adoption of youtube engagement ads, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base across all platforms, particularly mobile. the positive impact on our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. the decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other platforms, as well as changes in property and device mix, product mix, geographic mix, and ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.31table of contentsalphabet

websites revenues increased $116 million from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. the increase was primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying, offset by our traditional network businesses and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. the decrease in network members' websites revenues as a percentage of google segment revenues is due to relatively slower growth of network members' websites revenues compared to that of google websites revenues as well as google other revenues.the increase in paid clicks and decrease in cost-per-click paid by our advertisers resulted from ongoing product and policy changes, changes in property and device mix, product mix, and geographic mix, and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.google other revenuesthe following table presents our google other revenues (in millions) for the periods

and•licensing-related revenue.google other revenues increased $401 million from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 and increased as a percentage of google segment revenues.  these increases were primarily due to the growth of our sales of digital content products in the google play store, primarily apps (revenues which we recognize net of payout to partners) as well as growth in revenues from cloud and apps offerings for enterprise.  in addition, there was an increase in revenues from hardware sales.32table of contentsalphabet inc.other betsthe

consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q.use of constant currency and constant currency growththe impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons.  our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current period.constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.33table of contentsalphabet inc.the following table

primarily of traffic acquisition costs which are the advertising revenues shared with our google network members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website.additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:•the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs); •content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we share the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);•credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; •stock-based compensation expense;•revenue share payments to mobile carriers;•inventory costs for hardware we sell; and34table of contentsalphabet inc.•amortization of certain intangible assets. the following tables present our cost of revenues as well as our traffic acquisition costs for the periods presented (in

ads placed through our adsense program on the websites of our google network members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on google websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on google network members’ websites are shared with our google network members. for the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from google websites has generally exceeded that from our google network members’ websites. this had a positive impact on our income from operations during this period.cost of revenues increased $1,292 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of $443 million, resulting from more fees paid to our distribution partners for additional traffic directed to google websites, as well as more advertiser fees generated through our adsense program driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues. the remaining increase was driven by increases in data center costs, content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube and digital content, and hardware inventory costs. the decrease in aggregate traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix from google network members' websites revenue to google websites revenue, partially offset by the impact of the increase in mobile and programmatic advertising buying, which generally carry higher traffic acquisition costs.we expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the remainder of 2016 and future periods, based on a number of factors, including the following:•the relative growth rates of revenues from google websites and from our google network members’ websites;•the growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory costs;•increased proportion of non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues;•whether we are able to enter into more revenue share arrangements with google network members and distribution partners that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential google network members and distribution partners results in less favorable revenue share arrangements;•whether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on google websites and our google network members' websites;•the relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated.35table of

percentage of revenues from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $342 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $130 million, both largely as a result of an 11% increase in r&d headcount. in addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $73 million and an increase in professional service fees of $62 million primarily due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services. we expect that r&d expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in the remainder of 2016 and future periods.sales and marketingthe following table presents our sales and

relatively flat as a percentage of revenues from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. the increase in dollar amount was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $120 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $37 million, largely resulting from a 10% increase in sales and marketing headcount. in addition, there was an increase in advertising and promotion expense of $91 million and an increase in professional service fees of $31 million due to additional expenses incurred for temporary services, consulting, and outsourced services.we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in the remainder of 2016 and future periods.36table of contentsalphabet inc.general and administrativethe following table presents our general and administrative expenses (in millions) for the periods presented: three months ended march

compensation expense.general and administrative expenses decreased $124 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in professional services fees of $300 million due to lower legal-related costs. this was partially offset by an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $74 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $49 million, largely resulting from a 16% increase in general and administrative headcount, as well as an increase in miscellaneous general and administrative expenses of $57 million.we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in the remainder of 2016 and in future periods.stock-based compensationthe following table presents stock-based compensation expense for awards we expect to settle in equity (in millions) for the

to awards we expect to settle in equity increased $291 million from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. the increase was primarily driven by headcount growth. additionally, we recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with awards expected to be ultimately settled in cash of $0 million and $6 million in the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.we estimate stock-based compensation expense related to awards we expect to settle in equity to be approximately $5.5 billion in 2016 and $8.1 billion thereafter related to stock-based awards outstanding as of march 31, 2016. this estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to stock-based awards granted after march 31, 2016. 37table of

months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. this decrease was primarily related to increased losses recorded related to marketable and non-marketable securities combined with increased losses from our foreign currency hedging program due to the volatility in foreign currency markets. these losses were partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result of increased cash and fixed income investments.the costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income (expense), net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, and the volatility of foreign exchange rates.we expect that other income (expense), net, will fluctuate in dollar amount in the remainder of 2016 and future periods as it is largely driven by market dynamics.consolidated provision for income

taxes decreased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes as a result of the early adoption of asu 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2016. refer to note 1 of part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for further details. the decrease was also due to the recognition of the federal research and development credit, which became permanent in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was not reflected in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015.our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, tax effects related to stock-based compensation, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.capital resources and liquidityas of march 31, 2016, we had $75.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the u.s. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the u.s., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. from time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.38table of contentsalphabet inc.as of march 31, 2016, $45.4 billion of the $75.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations.our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. as of march 31, 2016, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.5% that matures at various dates through july 2016. in conjunction with this program, we have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in february 2021. the interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. as of march 31, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. in addition, we may make acquisitions, increase our capital expenditures, or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund these activities.in may 2011, google issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2011 notes) in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021. the net proceeds from the sale of the 2011 notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. in february 2014, google issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2014 notes) due in 2024, which was used to repay $1.0 billion of the first tranche of our 2011 notes that matured in may 2014 and for general corporate purposes. as of march 31, 2016, the outstanding notes had a total carrying value of $3.0 billion and a total estimated fair value of $3.2 billion. we are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes.  in april 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of google’s 3.625% notes due 2021 and 3.375% notes due 2024. an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the google notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of alphabet notes.in august 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028. we intend to exercise the option to purchase the property in 2016 with an estimated payment of $223 million as of march 31, 2016. the effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate.in october 2015, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of its class c capital stock,

repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of 10b5-1 plans. the repurchase program does not have an expiration date. for the three months ended march 31, 2016, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 3.2 million shares of alphabet class c capital stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.3 billion, of which $2.1 billion was paid in cash as of march 31, 2016.for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2016, our cash flows were as follows (in millions): three months ended march 31, 2015 2016 (unaudited)net cash provided by operating activities$6,722 $7,658net cash

service fees received for cloud and apps and our maps api. our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our google network members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. in addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.39table of contentsalphabet inc.net cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for non cash adjustments, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital.cash used in investing activitiescash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment,  purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio, investments in reverse repurchase agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program, as well as acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and intangible assets.cash used in investing activities decreased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. this was primarily due to decreases in activities related to securities lending, purchases of non-marketable investments, and purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by net increases in purchases of marketable securities.cash used in financing activitiescash used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities.cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 primarily driven by repurchases of capital stock and an increase in net payments related to stock-based award activities.contractual obligationswe had long-term taxes payable of $3.8 billion as of march 31, 2016 primarily related to uncertain tax positions. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.critical accounting policies and estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. in some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. in some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.please see note 1 of part i,

metricswhen assessing our advertising revenue performance, we present information regarding the number of "paid clicks" and "cost-per-click" for our google websites and google network members websites. management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.paid clicks for our google websites represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including gmail, finance, maps, and google play; and viewed youtube engagement ads like trueview (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad). paid clicks for our google network members' websites include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on google network members' properties participating in our adsense for search, adsense for content and admob businesses. in some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our revenue base. cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenue divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average cost we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.the rate of change in revenue and revenue growth, as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google websites and google network members' websites and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including:30table of contentsalphabet inc.•growth rates of our revenues from google websites, including youtube, compared to those of our revenues from google network members' websites;•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•seasonality;•the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;•a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenue generated in google websites and google network members' websites, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and•general economic conditions.our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.google websitesthe following table presents our google websites revenues (in millions) and

a percentage of google segment revenues69.5% 71.3 %paid clicks change  38 %cost-per-click change  (12)%google websites revenues consist primarily of:•adwords revenue that is generated on google.com. this includes revenue from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.;•advertising revenue generated on youtube, including, but not limited to youtube trueview and google preferred; and•advertising revenue generated from other google owned and operated properties like gmail, finance, maps, and google play.our google websites revenues increased $2,396 million from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 and also increased as a percentage of google segment revenues. our google websites revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search due to ongoing improvements in ad formats and delivery, growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as growth in youtube video advertising across trueview and google preferred, with a growing contribution from app promotions, partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs increased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 due to growth in the adoption of youtube engagement ads, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base across all platforms, particularly mobile. the positive impact on our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. the decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other platforms, as well as changes in property and device mix, product mix, geographic mix, and ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.31table of contentsalphabet inc.google network members' websitesthe following table presents

from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. the increase was primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying, offset by our traditional network businesses and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. the decrease in network members' websites revenues as a percentage of google segment revenues is due to relatively slower growth of network members' websites revenues compared to that of google websites revenues as well as google other revenues.the increase in paid clicks and decrease in cost-per-click paid by our advertisers resulted from ongoing product and policy changes, changes in property and device mix, product mix, and geographic mix, and the general strengthening of the u.s.

revenues increased $401 million from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 and increased as a percentage of google segment revenues.  these increases were primarily due to the growth of our sales of digital content products in the google play store, primarily apps (revenues which we recognize net of payout to partners) as well as growth in revenues from cloud and apps offerings for enterprise.  in addition, there was an increase in revenues from hardware sales.32table of contentsalphabet inc.other betsthe following table presents our other bets

statements included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q.use of constant currency and constant currency growththe impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons.  our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current period.constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.33table of contentsalphabet inc.the following table presents our foreign exchange impact

shared with our google network members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website.additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:•the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs); •content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we share the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);•credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; •stock-based compensation expense;•revenue share payments to mobile carriers;•inventory costs for hardware we sell; and34table of contentsalphabet inc.•amortization of certain intangible

acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues21.6% 21.0%the cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed through our adsense program on the websites of our google network members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on google websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on google network members’ websites are shared with our google network members. for the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from google websites has generally exceeded that from our google network members’ websites. this had a positive impact on our income from operations during this period.cost of revenues increased $1,292 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of $443 million, resulting from more fees paid to our distribution partners for additional traffic directed to google websites, as well as more advertiser fees generated through our adsense program driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues. the remaining increase was driven by increases in data center costs, content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube and digital content, and hardware inventory costs. the decrease in aggregate traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix from google network members' websites revenue to google websites revenue, partially offset by the impact of the increase in mobile and programmatic advertising buying, which generally carry higher traffic acquisition costs.we expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the remainder of 2016 and future periods, based on a number of factors, including the following:•the relative growth rates of revenues from google websites and from our google network members’ websites;•the growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory costs;•increased proportion of non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues;•whether we are able to enter into more revenue share arrangements with google network members and distribution partners that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential google network members and distribution partners results in less favorable revenue share arrangements;•whether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on google websites and our google network members' websites;•the relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated.35table of contentsalphabet inc.research and developmentthe following table presents our

months ended march 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $342 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $130 million, both largely as a result of an 11% increase in r&d headcount. in addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $73 million and an increase in professional service fees of $62 million primarily due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services. we expect that r&d expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage

hedging program due to the volatility in foreign currency markets. these losses were partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result of increased cash and fixed income investments.the costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income (expense), net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, and the volatility of foreign exchange rates.we expect that other income (expense), net, will fluctuate in dollar amount in the remainder of 2016 and future periods as it is largely driven by market dynamics.consolidated provision for income taxesthe following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions) and effective tax rate for the periods presented: three months ended march 31, 2015 2016 (unaudited)provision for income taxes$1,089 $922effective tax rate(1)23.7% 18.0%(1) early adoption of asu 2016-09 resulted in a favorable etr impact of 4% in the first quarter of 2016.our effective tax rate and provision for income taxes decreased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes as a result of the early adoption of asu 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2016. refer to note 1 of part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for further details. the decrease was also due to the recognition of the federal research and development credit, which became permanent in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was not reflected in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015.our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, tax effects related to stock-based compensation, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.capital resources and liquidityas of march 31, 2016, we had $75.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the u.s. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the u.s., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. from time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.38table of contentsalphabet inc.as of march 31, 2016, $45.4 billion of the $75.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations.our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. as of march 31, 2016, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.5% that matures at various dates through july 2016. in conjunction with this program, we have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in february 2021. the interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. as of march 31, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. in addition, we may make acquisitions, increase our capital expenditures, or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund these activities.in may 2011, google issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2011 notes) in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021. the net proceeds from the sale of the 2011 notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. in february 2014, google issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2014 notes) due in 2024, which was used to repay $1.0 billion of the first tranche of our 2011 notes that matured in may 2014 and for general corporate purposes. as of march 31, 2016, the outstanding notes had a total carrying value of $3.0 billion and a total estimated fair value of $3.2 billion. we are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes.  in april 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of google’s 3.625% notes due 2021 and 3.375% notes due 2024. an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the google notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of alphabet notes.in august 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028. we intend to exercise the option to purchase the property in 2016 with an estimated payment of $223 million as of march 31, 2016. the effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate.in october 2015, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of its class c capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015. in january 2016, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares. the repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of 10b5-1 plans. the repurchase program does not have an expiration date. for the three months ended march 31, 2016, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 3.2 million shares of alphabet class c capital stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.3 billion, of which $2.1 billion was paid in cash as of march 31, 2016.for the three months ended march 31, 2015 and 2016, our cash flows were as follows (in millions): three months ended march 31, 2015 2016 (unaudited)net cash provided by operating activities$6,722 $7,658net cash used in investing activities(7,304) (6,245)net cash used in financing activities(496) (2,911)cash provided by operating activitiesour largest source of cash provided by our operations is advertising revenues generated by google websites and google network members' websites. additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and digital content, hardware products, licensing arrangements, and service fees received for cloud and apps and our maps api. our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our google network members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. in addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.39table of contentsalphabet inc.net cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for non cash adjustments, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital.cash used in investing activitiescash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment,  purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio, investments in reverse repurchase agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program, as well as acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and intangible assets.cash used in investing activities decreased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016. this was primarily due to decreases in activities related to securities lending, purchases of non-marketable investments, and purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by net increases in purchases of marketable securities.cash used in financing activitiescash used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities.cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended march 31, 2015 to the three months ended march 31, 2016 primarily driven by repurchases of capital stock and an increase in net payments related to stock-based award activities.contractual obligationswe had long-term taxes payable of $3.8 billion as of march 31, 2016 primarily related to uncertain tax positions. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.critical accounting policies and estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. in some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. in some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.please see note 1 of part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for the summary of significant accounting policies. in addition, please see part i, item 7, "critical accounting policies and estimates" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015. there have
