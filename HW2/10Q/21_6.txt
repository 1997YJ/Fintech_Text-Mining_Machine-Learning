item 2.  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe following supplements management's discussion and analysis of mastercard incorporated for the year ended december 31, 2015 as contained in the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 12, 2016.  it also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated (together, “mastercard” or the “company”), included elsewhere in this report.  percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.  currency-neutral growth rates exclude the impacts from both translational and transactional foreign currency.  columns labeled “foreign currency” within the tables included within represent the impacts from both translational and transactional foreign currency.    overview mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  as the operator of what we believe is the world’s fastest payments network, we facilitate the processing of payment transactions, including authorization, clearing and settlement, and deliver related products and services.  we make payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including mastercard, maestro and cirrus.  we also provide value-added offerings such as loyalty and reward programs, information services and consulting.  our network is designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.  a typical transaction on our network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder (an individual who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), merchant, issuer (the cardholder’s financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).  we do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our branded cards.  in most cases, cardholder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution customers.we generate revenue by charging fees primarily to issuers and acquirers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services, as well as by assessing these customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or gross dollar volume (“gdv”), on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.our strategyour ability to grow our business is influenced by personal consumption expenditure growth, driving cash and check transactions toward electronic forms of payment, increasing our share in electronic payments and providing value-added products and services.  we drive growth by growing, diversifying and building our business.grow.  we focus on growing our core businesses globally, including growing our credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions and increasing the number of payment transactions we process.diversify.  we look to diversify our business by focusing on:•diversifying our customer base in new and existing markets by working with partners such as governments, merchants, large digital companies and other technology companies, mobile providers and other businesses;•encouraging use of our products and solutions in areas that provide new opportunities for electronic payments, such as transit and person-to-person transfers;•driving acceptance at small merchants and merchants who have not historically accepted mastercard products; and •broadening financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked.build.  we build our business by:•taking advantage of the opportunities presented by evolving ways consumers interact and transact as physical and digital payments converge; and 23table of contents•using our safety and security products and solutions, data analytics and loyalty solutions to add value.we grow, diversify and build our business through a combination of organic growth and strategic investments, including acquisitions.  strategic partners.  we work with a variety of stakeholders.  we provide financial institutions with solutions to help them increase revenue and increase preference for their mastercard-branded products.  we help merchants by delivering data-driven insights and other services to help them grow and create better and secure purchase experiences for consumers across physical and digital channels.  we partner with large digital companies and other technology companies, mobile providers and telecommunication companies  to support their digital payment solutions with our technology, expertise and security protocols.  we help national and local governments drive increased financial inclusion and efficiency, reduce costs, increase transparency to reduce crime and corruption and advance social programs.  for consumers, we provide better, safer and more convenient ways to pay.special items and non-gaap financial informationnon-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (“gaap”).  see “financial results overview” for the table that provides a reconciliation of the non-gaap operating results and growth to the most directly comparable gaap measures.  these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of the following special items (“special items”): •in the second quarter of 2016, the company recorded a provision for litigation of $107 million ($78 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to a judgment issued against the company in a litigation with a merchant in the u.k.•in the second quarter of 2015, the company recorded a provision for litigation of $61 million ($44 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) related to a settlement with a merchant in the u.k. •in the third quarter of 2015, the company recorded a settlement charge of $79 million ($50 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share) relating to the termination of its qualified u.s. defined benefit pension plan in general and administrative expenses (the “u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge”).the provisions for litigation for both years discussed above, relate to separate merchant litigations in the u.k. (collectively the “u.k. merchant litigation provision”).  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item i of this report for further discussion.  mastercard excluded the u.k. merchant litigation provision because its management monitors material litigation judgments and settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts.  the company also excluded the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge because its management monitors significant one-time items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts.  for additional discussion regarding the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge, see note 11 (pension, postretirement and savings plans) in part ii, item 8 of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015.in addition, mastercard presents growth rates on a currency-neutral basis, which is a non-gaap financial measure.  currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results.  the impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.  the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  mastercard’s management believes the presentation of certain currency-neutral growth rates provides relevant information.mastercard’s management believes that the non-gaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of mastercard’s operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods.  mastercard’s management uses non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.  the presentation of non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap.24table of

of 21% and 7%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in the prior year.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, earnings per diluted share was $1.08 and $2.83, up 26% and 11%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in the prior year. excluding the impact of special items, adjusted net income increased 15% and 6%, or 15% and 8% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015.  in addition, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 19% and 10%, or 19% and 12% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015.  key highlights for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016 are as follows:•for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, our net revenue increased 14% and 12%, respectively, or 14% for both periods on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable periods in 2015, primarily driven by increases across our revenue categories, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives.  our processed transactions increased 18% and 15% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015.  on a local currency basis, our worldwide gdv increased 7% and 11%, respectively, and cross border volumes increased 12% for both periods, versus the comparable periods in 2015. •for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, operating expenses increased 4% and 14%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015.  for those same periods, adjusted operating expenses, which excludes the impact of special items, increased 12% and 16%, or 12% and 17% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015.  these increases are primarily due to higher personnel costs due to continued investment in our strategic initiatives, as well as higher data processing expenses.  in addition, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, the impact from foreign exchange derivative contracts and balance sheet remeasurement increased operating expense growth by 2 and 4 percentage points, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015. •for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was 27.5% and 27.9%, respectively.  the effective tax rate decreased 0.2 percentage points for the three months ended september 30, 2016 versus the comparable period in 2015, due to various discrete benefits recognized in the period, which were partially offset by a lower repatriation benefit.  the effective tax rate increased 2.1 percentage points for the nine months ended september 30, 2016 versus the comparable period in 2015, due to the lapping of foreign tax credits recorded in 2015 and a lower repatriation benefit in the current year, which were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings in 2016.  other financial highlights for the nine months ended september 30, 2016 were as follows:•we generated net cash flows from operations of $3.5 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the comparable period in 2015.•we repurchased 26.3 million shares and paid dividends of $630 million.business environment we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies.  net revenue generated in the united states was 38% of total net revenue for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016 and 39% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2015.  no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total net revenue in each period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time.  while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate.  certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  in addition, further political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  as a result, our 26table of contentsrevenue may be negatively impacted, or the company may be impacted in several ways.  mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry.  the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business.  for a full discussion see, “risk factors - business risks” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015.in addition, our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries.  regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry.  for further discussion, see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report and our risk factors in “risk factors - legal and regulatory risks” in part i, item 1a (risk factors) of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015.  further, information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years.  although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future.  see our risk factor in “risk factors - business risks” in part i, item 1a of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015 related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks. impact of foreign currency ratesour overall operating results can be impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency.  the impact of transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives.  in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currencies.  for example, our billing in australia is in the u.s. dollar, however, consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar.  the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our u.s. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated.  the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, gdv on a u.s. dollar-converted basis increased 5% and 7%, respectively, while gdv on a local currency basis grew 7% and 11%, respectively.  further, the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency. the following table provides a summary of the foreign currency translational and transactional impact on growth for the following items in operating results for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, versus the comparable periods in 2015: positive (negative) impact from foreign currency 1 three months ended september 30, 2016 nine months ended september 30, 2016net revenueless than (1%) (2)%operating expenses1% 2%net incomeless than 1% (2)%1 excludes the impact from special items.in addition, the company incurs foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts (collectively “foreign exchange activity”).  the impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results (see “non-gaap financial information”) and is recorded in general and administrative expenses.  the company attempts to manage the impact of transactional foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this 27table of contentsreport.  since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize.  financial resultsrevenuerevenue descriptionmastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders’ financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions).  our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services.  our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers.  our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers.  our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following:•domestic or cross-border transactions;•signature-based or pin-based transactions;•geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs;•volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates;•processed or not processed across the mastercard network;•amount of usage of our other products or services; and•amount of rebates and incentives provided to customers.the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories:1.domestic assessments: domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same.  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.2.cross-border volume fees: cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different.  in general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.3.transaction processing fees: transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions.  transaction processing fees include charges for the following:•switching fees for the following products and services:øauthorization is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval.  in certain circumstances such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, mastercard or others, on behalf of the issuer approve in accordance with either the issuer’s instructions or applicable rules (also known as “stand-in”).øclearing is the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.28table of contentsøsettlement is facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.•connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages.  these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company’s network.•other processing fees: we extend our processing capabilities in the payment value chain for issuer and acquirer solutions; payment gateways for e-commerce merchants; and mobile gateways for mobile initiated transactions.  4.other revenues: other revenues consist of other payment-related products and services and are primarily associated with the following:•consulting, data analytic and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company’s professional advisory services group.•safety and security services fees are for products and services we offer to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and to ensure the safety of transactions made on mastercard products.  we work with issuers, merchants and governments to help deploy standards for safe and secure transactions for the global payments system. •loyalty and rewards solution fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with mastercard-branded cards, such as  access to a global airline lounge network, global and local concierge services, individual insurance coverages, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advance services and a 24-hour cardholder service center.  for merchants, we provide targeted offers and rewards campaigns and management services for publishing offers, as well as opportunities for holders of co-brand or loyalty cards and rewards program members to obtain rewards points faster.•program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.•the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related products and services, including account and transaction enhancement services, rules compliance and publications.5.rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue.revenue analysisin the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, gross revenue increased 16% and 14%, respectively, or 16% for both periods on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable periods in 2015.  gross revenue growth in the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016 was driven by an increase in transactions, dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, and other payment-related products and services.  rebates and incentives, in the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, increased 20% for both periods, or 21% and 22%, on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015, primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.  our net revenue for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, increased 14% and 12%, respectively, or 14% for both periods on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable periods in 2015. 29table of contentsthe following

eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments, that became effective june 9, 2016 (“article 8”), states that a network can no longer collect fees on domestic european economic area payment transactions that do not use its payment brand.  prior to that, mastercard collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries, particularly france, on transactions with mastercard co-badged cards if the brands of domestic networks (as opposed to mastercard) were used.  as a result, the non-mastercard co-badged volume is no longer being included.  the following table reflects gdv growth rates for europe and worldwide mastercard.  for comparability purposes, we adjusted growth rates for the impact of article 8 to exclude the prior period co-badged volume processed by other

administrative, advertising and marketing, depreciation and amortization and provision for litigation settlements.  operating expenses increased 4% and 14%, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015.  excluding the impact of special items, adjusted operating expenses increased 12% and 16%, or 12% and 17% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015.  these increases are primarily due to increased personnel costs in the current year due to our continued investment in the areas of digital, services, data analytics and geographic expansion, as well as higher data processing expenses.  in addition, foreign exchange derivative contracts and balance sheet remeasurement increased operating expense growth by 2 and 4 percentage points for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015. the components of operating expenses for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  three months ended september 30, percent increase

amount include the impact of the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge of $79 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015, which decreased personnel expense growth by 15 and 6 percentage points for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, respectively.  excluding the impact of the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge, adjusted personnel expense grew 13% for both the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016 versus the comparable periods in 2015. 33table of contentsthe primary drivers of changes in general and administrative expenses for three and nine months ended september 30, 2016 versus the comparable periods in 2015 were:•personnel expenses decreased 2% for the three months ended september 30, 2016 and increased 7% for the nine months ended september 30, 2016 versus the comparable periods in 2015.  excluding the impact of the special item for the u.s. employee pension plan settlement charge of $79 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015, adjusted personnel expenses increased 13%, or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, for both the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016 versus the comparable periods in 2015.  the increase was driven by a higher number of employees to support our continued investment in the areas of digital, services, data analytics and geographic expansion, along with wage increases. •professional fees consist primarily of third-party services, legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and the evaluation of regulatory developments that impact our industry and brand.  the increase is primarily due to higher legal costs to defend litigation.•data processing and telecommunication expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other telecommunication systems.  the increase is due to capacity growth of our business and higher third-party processing costs.  •foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  during the three months ended september 30, 2016, foreign exchange activity negatively impacted general and administrative expense growth by 3 percentage points versus the comparable period in 2015, due to the impact from foreign exchange  derivative contracts, partially offset by lower balance sheet remeasurement losses versus the prior year.  during the nine months ended september 30, 2016, foreign exchange activity negatively impacted general and administrative expense growth by 6 percentage points versus the comparable period in 2015, due to the impact from foreign exchange derivative contracts and the lapping of balance sheet remeasurement gains in the prior year.•other expenses include costs to provide loyalty and rewards programs, travel and meeting expenses and rental expense for our facilities.  other expenses increased primarily due to costs related to a customer dispute in the second quarter of 2016, as well as higher cardholder services and loyalty costs.advertising and marketingour brands, principally mastercard, are valuable strategic assets that drive acceptance and usage of our products and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally.  our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotions, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale.  we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences.  for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, advertising and marketing expenses were relatively flat for both periods, or increased 1% and 2% on a currency-neutral basis, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015, mainly due to the timing of promotions.depreciation and amortizationfor the three months ended september 30, 2016,  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 2%, or less than 1% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized.  for the nine months ended september 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization expenses increased 3%, or 4% on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs associated with our acquisitions, partially offset by lower amortization for certain fully amortized intangibles.provision for litigation settlementduring the nine months ended september 30, 2016, the company recorded a provision for litigation of $107 million related to a judgment issued against the company in a litigation with a merchant in the u.k.  during the nine months ended september 30, 2015, the company entered into a settlement with a merchant in the u.k. and recorded a provision for litigation of $61 million.  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion.34table of contentsother income (expense)other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses.  total other expense increased $20 million and $25 million for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2016, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015, primarily due to an impairment charge taken on an investment and higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in december 2015, partially offset by higher investment income.income taxes the effective income tax rates were 27.5% and 27.7% for the three months ended september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  the effective income tax rates were 27.9% and 25.8% for the nine months ended september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  for the three months ended september 30, 2016, the reduction in the effective tax rate versus the comparable period in 2015 was due to various discrete benefits recognized in the period, which were partially offset by a lower repatriation benefit.  for the nine months ended september 30, 2016, the increase in the effective tax rate versus the comparable period in 2015 was due to the lapping of discrete benefits recognized in 2015 relating to certain foreign taxes becoming eligible to be claimed as credits in the united states and a lower repatriation benefit in the current year, which were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of taxable earnings in 2016.liquidity and capital resourceswe believe that our cash, cash equivalents, investments, credit available and access to capital markets, together with cash flow generated from our operations, are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.  we need liquidity to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, investments in our business, current and potential obligations, share repurchases, and dividend payments.  the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to the company at september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2015: september 30, 2016 december 31, 2015 (in billions)cash, cash equivalents and investments 1$7.0 $6.7unused line of credit 23.8 3.81 investments include available-for-sale securities and short-term held-to-maturity securities.  at september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2015, this amount excludes restricted cash related to the u.s. merchant class litigation settlement of $543 million and $541 million, respectively, and long-term held-to-maturity securities of $62 million at september 30, 2016.2 the company had no borrowings outstanding under its line of credit as of september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2015.cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $4.3 billion and $3.3 billion at september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively, or 61% and 48% of our total as of such dates.  it is our present intention to indefinitely reinvest historic undistributed accumulated earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings.  if these earnings are needed for u.s. operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states, the company would be required to record a liability for such u.s. taxes for the historic undistributed accumulated earnings at that time.  such taxes would be due upon repatriation of such earnings to the united states.our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers.  see note 12 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part i, item 1 of this report for a description of these guarantees.  historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of the future.  the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see part i, item 1a - risk factors 35table of contentsof the company’s

lower net proceeds from investment securities in the current year, partially offset by the impact of prior year acquisitions.net cash used in financing activities decreased by $248 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2016, versus the comparable period in 2015, due to lower repurchases of the company’s class a common stock in the current year, partially offset by higher dividends.the

amount of notes due 2030 (collectively the “euro notes”).  in march 2014, the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2019 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes due 2024 (collectively the “usd notes”).  the company is not subject to any financial covenants under the euro notes and the usd notes (collectively the “notes”).  interest on the euro notes is payable annually on december 1.  interest on the usd notes is payable semi-annually on april 1 and october 1.  the notes may be redeemed in whole, or in part, at the company’s option at any time for a specified make-whole amount.  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and would rank equally with any future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. in november 2015, the company established a commercial paper program (the “commercial paper program”).  under the commercial paper program, the company is authorized to issue up to $3.75 billion in outstanding notes, denominated in u.s. dollars, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.  in conjunction with the commercial paper program, the company entered into a committed unsecured $3.75 billion revolving credit facility (the “credit facility”) in october 2015.  the 36table of contentscredit facility amended and restated the company’s prior credit facility.  borrowings under the credit facility are available in u.s. dollars and/or euros.  in october 2016, the company extended the credit facility for an additional year to october 2021.  there were no material changes to the terms and conditions of the credit facility.  the facility fee and borrowing cost under the credit facility are dependent upon the company’s credit rating.  currently, the applicable facility fee is 8 basis points on the average daily commitment (whether or not utilized).  in addition to the facility fee, interest on borrowings under the credit facility would be charged at the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus an applicable margin of 79.5 basis points, or an alternative base rate. the credit facility contains customary representations, warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the maximum level of consolidated debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda), which are substantially similar to the prior credit facility.  mastercard was in compliance in all material respects with the covenants of the credit facility as of september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2015.  the majority of credit facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of mastercard.borrowings under the credit facility and the commercial paper program are used for general corporate purposes.  mastercard had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility or the commercial paper program at september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2015. dividends and share repurchases mastercard has historically paid quarterly dividends on its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock.  subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend.  however, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.on december 8, 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share paid on february 9, 2016 to holders of record on january 8, 2016 of

and $548 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.shares in the company's common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock.  the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions.  in december 2015, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to $4 billion of our class a common stock.  this program became effective in february
