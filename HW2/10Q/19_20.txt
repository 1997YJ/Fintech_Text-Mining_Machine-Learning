("hd supply guarantee"). excluding this benefit, net earnings were $992 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.65 for the first quarter of fiscal 2012.net sales increased 5.9% to $17.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 from $16.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. our comparable store sales increased 5.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, driven by a 3.8% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and an increase in our comparable store average ticket. comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 6.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives:customer service – our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of putting customers first, taking care of ourassociates and simplifying the business. in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we began the roll out of our "first phone junior" to all of our stores. this version of our first phone combines the communication features of a phone with the product and inventory lookup features of our first phone, but without the complex business analytics and product ordering features of the first phone. this allows us to spread the basic functionality and customer service benefits of the first phone throughout the store at a lower cost.product authority – our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy,which is aimed at delivering innovation, assortment and value. as part of this effort, we are introducing innovative new products and great values for both our professional and do-it-yourself customers in a variety of departments, including electrical, hardware and décor.productivity and efficiency – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through building best-in-classcompetitive advantages in information technology and supply chain, as well as building shareholder value through higherreturns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we saw continued benefits from our supply chain investments, which improved our gross profit margin 11table of contentsand asset efficiency. our inventory turnover ratio was 4.3 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 3.9 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011. during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into a $1.0 billion accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement. we received an initial delivery of approximately 17 million shares of our common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 under the asr agreement and approximately 3 million additional shares upon completion of the asr agreement in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. also during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 2 million additional shares of our common stock through the open market. interconnected retail – our focus on interconnected retail is based on the view that providing a seamless shoppingexperience across multiple channels will be a critical enabler for future success. our multiple channel focus is allowing us togreatly expand our assortment of merchandise, and as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we have over 500,000 products available online, including our home decorators collection website. we also rolled out a significant upgrade of our website during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, which enhanced the layout, visual appearance and responsiveness of the site.we opened two new stores in the u.s. during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, for a total store count of 2,254 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012, a total of 278 of these stores, or 12.3%, were located in canada, mexico and china compared to 272 stores, or 12.1%, as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011.we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. we used a portion of this cash flow to fund $1.1 billion of share repurchases, pay $444 million of dividends and fund $228 million in capital expenditures.at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012, our long-term debt-to-equity ratio increased to 60.0% from 58.9% at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2011. our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 15.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 13.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.12table of contentswe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. % of net

accepted accounting principles.n/a – not applicable13table of contentsresults of operationsnet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 increased 5.9% to $17.8 billion from $16.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. the increase in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. total comparable store sales increased 5.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to a decrease of 0.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. the positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 reflect a number of factors. our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was driven by strength in our core departments as well as unusually warm weather. all of our departments, except for two, posted positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. comparable store sales for our indoor garden, lumber, outdoor garden, electrical, décor, paint and hardware product categories were above the company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. comparable store sales for our lighting, tools, millwork, building materials, bath and flooring product categories were positive for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. comparable store sales for our plumbing product category were flat and for our kitchen product category were slightly negative for the first quarter of 2012. gross profit increased 6.1% to $6.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 from $5.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 8 basis points to 34.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 34.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. the increase in gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by benefits arising from our supply chain transformation in the u.s.selling, general and administrative expense (“sg&a”) increased 1.9% to $4.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 from $4.0 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 22.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 23.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment. depreciation and amortization decreased 3.5% to $383 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 from $397 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 2.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 2.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and an increase in fully depreciated assets that are still utilized in the business.operating income increased 20.5% to $1.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 from $1.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. operating income as a percent of net sales was 9.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 8.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we recognized $84 million of interest and other, net, compared to $139 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 0.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. interest and other, net, for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 reflects a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our hd supply guarantee. excluding this benefit, interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2011.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 36.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.diluted earnings per share were $0.68 for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to $0.50 for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, an increase of 36.0%. excluding the $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our hd supply guarantee from the first quarter of fiscal 2012 results, diluted earnings per share increased 30.0% to $0.65 for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 14table of contentsto provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with non-gaap financial measures to reflect certain adjustments. the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our hd supply guarantee as described more fully in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. there were no adjustments for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 for events of unusual nature or frequency. we believe these non-gaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. the following reconciles the non-gaap financial measures to the

significant source of liquidity. during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the same period of fiscal 2011. this increase was primarily a result of increased net earnings and changes in net working capital items.net cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $221 million compared to $184 million for the same period of fiscal 2011. this change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures. net cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was $1.1 billion compared to $664 million for the same period of fiscal 2011. this change was primarily the result of $1.0 billion in net proceeds from long-term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, partially offset by $378 million more in proceeds from sales of common stock due to increased stock option exercises and $170 million less in repurchases of common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the same period of fiscal 2011.in march 2012, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. under the agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and received an initial delivery of approximately 17 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. the transaction was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, at which time we received approximately 3 million additional shares. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the asr agreement. also in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 2 million additional shares of our common stock for $100 million through the open market. as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012, $5.3 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. as of april 29, 2012, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. the credit facility expires in july 2013 and contains various restrictive covenants. as of april 29, 2012, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.as of april 29, 2012, we had $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.15table of contents
