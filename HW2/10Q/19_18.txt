("ushs"). ushs is an exclusive provider of kitchen and bath refacing products and services as well as closet and garage organizational systems to the home depot. this acquisition will allow us to create more effective interconnection between our stores and the ushs in-home selling platform, similar to what we have done with our roofing, siding and windows businesses.we opened three new stores, including two new stores in mexico and one relocation in the u.s., and closed seven stores in china during the third quarter of fiscal 2012, for a total store count of 2,250 at the end of the quarter.

to $18.1 billion from $17.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. for the first nine months of fiscal 2012, net sales increased 3.9% to $56.5 billion from $54.4 billion for the comparable period of fiscal 2011. the increase in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. total comparable store sales increased 4.2% for the third quarter of both fiscal 2012 and 2011. for the first nine months of fiscal 2012, total comparable store sales increased 3.9% compared to an increase of 2.7% for the same period of fiscal 2011.the positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 reflect a number of factors. all of our departments except for one posted positive comparable store sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012, and comparable store average ticket increased 2.9% and 2.2% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012, respectively. comparable store sales for our lumber, décor, paint, kitchen, outdoor garden, bath, lighting, electrical, indoor garden, hardware and flooring product categories were above the company average for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. comparable store sales for our plumbing, tools and millwork product categories were positive for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. comparable store sales for our building materials product category were negative for the third quarter of 2012, reflecting the impact of weather and difficult year-over-year comparisons in roofing due to storm and repair activity that drove sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. gross profit increased 5.1% to $6.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 from $6.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. gross profit increased 4.3% to $19.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 from $18.7 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2011. gross profit for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a $10 million charge related to the china store closings. gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 34.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. excluding the charge related to the china store closings, gross profit margin increased 22 basis points for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 driven primarily by lower shrink and our supply chain transformation in the u.s. for the first nine months of fiscal 2012, gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.5% compared to 34.3% for the comparable period of fiscal 2011. the increase in gross profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by a change in mix of products sold and our supply chain transformation in the u.s. selling, general and administrative expenses (“sg&a”) increased 4.6% to $4.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 from $4.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2011, and increased 1.2% to $12.3 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 from $12.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2011. sg&a for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a $155 million charge related to the china store closings. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 22.8% for the third quarter of both fiscal 2012 and 2011. excluding the charge related to the china store closings, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 22.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first nine months of fiscal 2012, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 21.8% compared to 22.3% for the same period last year. excluding the charge related to the china store closings, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 21.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2012. sg&a as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and lower credit card and natural disaster expense offset by the charge related to the china store closings.depreciation and amortization increased 1.3% to $395 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 from $390 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. depreciation and amortization was $1.2 billion for the first nine months of both fiscal 2012 and 2011. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was

fiscal 2011. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment and an increase in fully depreciated assets that are still utilized in the business.operating income increased 7.3% to $1.7 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 from $1.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. operating income increased 12.8% to $6.0 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 from $5.3 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2011.

effective income tax rate was 37.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 compared to 36.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2011. the effective income tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was higher than the same period of fiscal 2011 as we were unable to realize any tax benefit from the $165 million of charges related to the china store closings. excluding the charges related to the china store closings, our combined effective income tax rate was 36.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2012.diluted earnings per share were $0.63 and $2.32 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012, respectively, compared to $0.60 and $1.97 for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2011, respectively. excluding the charges related to the china store

share for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 reflect $0.02 and $0.10, respectively, of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended october 28, 2012.to provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with non-gaap financial measures to reflect certain adjustments. the results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a $165 million charge, net of tax, related to the china store closings as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, the results for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our hd supply guarantee as described more fully in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. there were no adjustments for the third quarter or first nine months of fiscal 2011 for events of unusual nature or frequency. we believe these non-gaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures.

months of fiscal 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.4 billion compared to $5.7 billion for the same period of fiscal 2011. this change was primarily a result of $481 million less in cash provided by a change in merchandise inventories as a result of increased inventory purchases in support of increased sales and $226 million less in cash provided by a change in income taxes payable driven by the timing of tax payments, partially offset by a $405 million increase in net earnings.net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $987 million compared to $683 million for the same period of fiscal 2011. this change was primarily due to payments for businesses acquired, net, of $121 million related to purchases of a flooring measurement company and a provider of kitchen and bath refacing products and services in the first nine months of fiscal 2012, proceeds from sale of business, net, of $101 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 related to the sale of a non-core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business, and a $67 million increase in capital expenditures in the first nine months of fiscal 2012 compared to the same period of fiscal 2011.net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 was $3.8 billion compared to $3.3 billion for the same period of fiscal 2011. this change was primarily the result of $1.0 billion in net proceeds from long-term borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2011 and $274 million more in repurchases of common stock in the first nine months of fiscal 16table of contents2012 than in the same period of fiscal 2011, partially offset by $606 million more in proceeds from sales of common stock due to increased stock option exercises in the first nine months of fiscal 2012 compared to the same period of fiscal 2011.in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.0 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and received an initial delivery of approximately 17 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. the transaction was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, at which time we received approximately 3 million additional shares. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.0 billion asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement. in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.4 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.4 billion to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and received an initial delivery of approximately 22 million shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. the transaction was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, at which time we received approximately 5 million additional shares. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.4 billion asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement. in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $650 million of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $650 million to the financial institution, using cash on hand, and received an initial delivery of approximately 9 million shares in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $650 million asr agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement.in the first nine months of fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 5 million additional shares of our common stock for $250 million through the open market. as of the end of the first nine months of fiscal 2012, $3.1 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we replaced our back-up credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in july 2013, with a new, substantially identical $2.0 billion credit facility. as of october 28, 2012, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. the new credit facility expires in july 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. as of october 28, 2012, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.as of october 28, 2012, we had $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.17table of contents
