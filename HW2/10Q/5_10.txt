item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a. "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.certain revenue information in the section entitled "—three and six months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014—revenue—foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.executive overview of second quarter resultsour key user metrics and financial results for the second quarter of 2015 are as follows:user growth:•daily active users (daus) were 968 million on average for june 2015, an increase of 17% year-over-year.•mobile daus were 844 million on average for june 2015, an increase of 29% year-over-year.•monthly active users (maus) were 1.49 billion as of june 30, 2015, an increase of 13% year-over-year.•mobile maus were 1.31 billion as of june 30, 2015, an increase of 23% year-over-year.financial results:•revenue was $4.04 billion, up 39% year-over-year (or 50% year-over-year on a constant currency basis), and ad revenue was $3.83 billion, up 43% year-over-year (or 55% year-over-year on a constant currency basis).•total costs and expenses were $2.77 billion.•income from operations was $1.27 billion.•net income was $719 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.25.•capital expenditures were $549 million.•effective tax rate was 44%.•cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $14.13 billion as of june 30, 2015.•headcount increased to 10,955 as of june 30, 2015.in the second quarter of 2015, we continued to focus on three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, especially small- and medium-sized businesses around the world, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through new ad formats and tools for marketers. in addition, we invested, and will continue to invest, across three priorities: (i) our current generation of services by improving the speed and reliability of our apps and building new infrastructure, such as the recently announced data center project in texas, and connecting people with the content they want such as more engaging videos, (ii) our next generation of services, including new features on messenger, whatsapp and search, and (iii) our long-term innovation efforts such as internet.org, which provides free basic internet services in certain countries, and the consumer version of the oculus rift. we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will continue to drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2014, driven primarily by increased headcount-related expenses as well as our capital expenditures, which we expect to be between $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion for 2015.20trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), mobile daus, maus, mobile maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram or whatsapp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated. trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our messenger app (and is also a registered facebook user), or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with facebook, on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 21worldwide daus increased 17% to 968 million on average during june 2015 from 829 million during june 2014. we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india, the united states, and brazil. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in june 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.•mobile daus. we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger app (and is also a registered facebook user) on a given day. we define a mobile-only dau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day, whereas a mobile dau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer on that day. worldwide mobile daus increased 29% to 844 million on average during june 2015 from 654 million during june 2014. in all regions, an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during june 2015 as compared to the same period during 2014, with users in brazil, india, and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during june 2015. on average during june 2015, there were 688 million mobile-only daus, increasing 41% from 488 million mobile-only daus during the same period in 2014. the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.22•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our messenger app (and is also a registered facebook user), or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.    as of june 30, 2015, we had 1.49 billion maus, an increase of 13% from june 30, 2014. users in india, thailand, and the united states represented key sources of growth in the second quarter of 2015 relative to the same period in 2014. overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in june 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.23•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger app (and is also a registered facebook user) during the period of measurement. we define a mobile-only mau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement, whereas a mobile mau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement.worldwide mobile maus increased 23% to 1.31 billion as of june 30, 2015 from 1.07 billion as of june 30, 2014. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth in the second quarter of 2015. there were 655 million mobile-only maus as of june 30, 2015, increasing 64% from 399 million mobile-only maus during the same period in 2014. the remaining 659 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during june 2015. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.24trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users. for example, arpu for an average user in the second quarter of 2015 in the united states & canada region was more than seven times higher than for an average user in the asia-pacific region.note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 25during the second quarter of 2015, worldwide arpu was $2.76, an increase of 23% from the second quarter of 2014. over this period, arpu increased by 44% in united states & canada, 19% in asia-pacific, 18% in europe, and 5% in rest of world. the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the second quarter of 2014 to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on the growth rate of our arpu outside the united states and canada region. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia-pacific and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.26components of results of operationsrevenuewe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers.advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties, including our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action.payments and other fees. we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include people-, marketer-, and developer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include professional and legal services. general and administrative expenses also include depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets we have acquired.27results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of income

first six months of 2015 increased $1.13 billion or 39%, and $2.17 billion, or 40%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2014. the increases were primarily due to increases in advertising revenue.the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices. news feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement, and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. for the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented 76% and 74%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with 62% and 60% in the same periods in 2014.other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) certain product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads, and (iii) an increase in user growth and engagement. during the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, the average price per ad increased by 220% and 251%, respectively, and the number of ads delivered decreased by 55% and 59%, respectively. the 29increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-news feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed. the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.payments and other fees revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015 decreased $19 million, or 8%, and $29 million, or 6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2014. the decreases were primarily due to decreases in payments revenue from games played on personal computers. facebook usage on personal computers has been declining and will continue to decline in the future, resulting in a decline in our payments revenue. these decreases were partially offset by increases in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.foreign exchange impact on revenuethe general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the euro) from the second quarter and the first six months of 2014 to the same periods in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue would have been $4.37 billion and $8.11 billion, respectively, and our advertising revenue would have been $4.16 billion and $7.66 billion, respectively, which are $332 million and $520 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, respectively.cost of revenue three months ended june 30,   six months ended june

to increases in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure of $118 million and $240 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively, and to a lesser extent, increased amortization of our intangible assets of $36 million and $71 million in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in

and $769 million in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2014. in addition, other payroll and benefits expenses in both periods increased as a result of a 62% growth in employee headcount from june 30, 2014 to june 30, 2015 in engineering and other technical functions. 30marketing and sales three months ended june 30,   six months ended

expenses in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, respectively. payroll and benefits expenses also increased as a result of a 41% increase in employee headcount from june 30, 2014 to

higher return on our marketable securities. this increase was partially offset by decreases in other income/(expense), net in both periods, primarily due to increases in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances.31provision for income taxes  three months ended june 30,   six months ended june 30,   2015 2014 % change 2015 2014 %

first six months of 2015 decreased $41 million and $53 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2014, primarily due to decreases in income before provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate in the second quarter was flat, compared to the same period in 2014. our effective tax rate increased in the first six months of 2015 compared, to the same period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in non-deductible share-based compensation related to acquisitions.our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the effect of non-deductible share-based compensation and the impact of acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions. our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing, size, and integration of any acquisitions we make.32liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $14.13 billion as of june 30, 2015, an increase of $2.93 billion from december 31, 2014, primarily due to $3.58 billion of cash generated from operations and $809 million in excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, partially offset by $1.05 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $282 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets.  in august 2013, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 revolving credit facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15, 2018. as of june 30, 2015, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. as of june 30, 2015, $1.52 billion of the $14.13 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary. these subsidiaries have historically incurred losses; as such, repatriating the funds will likely incur no residual tax liability. we have provided for residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary, however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant. we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2015 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $1.46 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $916 million. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was mostly due to an increase in net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above. cash used in investing activitiescash flow from investing activities during the first six months of 2015 primarily consisted of purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets. the increase in cash used in investing activities during the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to $679 million increase in net purchases of marketable securities, and to a lesser extent, an increase in acquisition of businesses and purchases of intangible assets. in addition, there was an increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of server network infrastructure, data center construction, and office buildings. we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2015 of approximately $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion. cash provided by financing activitiescash flow from financing activities during the first six months of 2015 primarily consisted of excess tax benefits from share-based award activity and principal payments on capital lease obligations. the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was mostly due to decreased excess tax benefit from stock award activities and $12 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement of whatsapp's vested merger consideration, partially offset by lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions.off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2015.contractual obligationsthere were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2014.33contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 9 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding these contingencies.recent accounting pronouncementin may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. in july 2015, the fasb decided to delay the effective date of asu 2014-09 by one year. the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. as such, the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. we are still evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2014. 34item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a. "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.certain revenue information in the section entitled "—three and six months ended june 30, 2015 and 2014—revenue—foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.executive overview of second quarter resultsour key user metrics and financial results for the second quarter of 2015 are as follows:user growth:•daily active users (daus) were 968 million on average for june 2015, an increase of 17% year-over-year.•mobile daus were 844 million on average for june 2015, an increase of 29% year-over-year.•monthly active users (maus) were 1.49 billion as of june 30, 2015, an increase of 13% year-over-year.•mobile maus were 1.31 billion as of june 30, 2015, an increase of 23% year-over-year.financial results:•revenue was $4.04 billion, up 39% year-over-year (or 50% year-over-year on a constant currency basis), and ad revenue was $3.83 billion, up 43% year-over-year (or 55% year-over-year on a constant currency basis).•total costs and expenses were $2.77 billion.•income from operations was $1.27 billion.•net income was $719 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.25.•capital expenditures were $549 million.•effective tax rate was 44%.•cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $14.13 billion as of june 30, 2015.•headcount increased to 10,955 as of june 30, 2015.in the second quarter of 2015, we continued to focus on three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, especially small- and medium-sized businesses around the world, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through new ad formats and tools for marketers. in addition, we invested, and will continue to invest, across three priorities: (i) our current generation of services by improving the speed and reliability of our apps and building new infrastructure, such as the recently announced data center project in texas, and connecting people with the content they want such as more engaging videos, (ii) our next generation of services, including new features on messenger, whatsapp and search, and (iii) our long-term innovation efforts such as internet.org, which provides free basic internet services in certain countries, and the consumer version of the oculus rift. we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will continue to drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2014, driven primarily by increased headcount-related expenses as well as our capital expenditures, which we expect to be between $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion for 2015.20trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), mobile daus, maus, mobile maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram or whatsapp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated. trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our messenger app (and is also a registered facebook user), or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with facebook, on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 21worldwide daus increased 17% to 968 million on average during june 2015 from 829 million during june 2014. we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india, the united states, and brazil. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in june 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.•mobile daus. we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger app (and is also a registered facebook user) on a given day. we define a mobile-only dau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day, whereas a mobile dau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer on that day. worldwide mobile daus increased 29% to 844 million on average during june 2015 from 654 million during june 2014. in all regions, an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during june 2015 as compared to the same period during 2014, with users in brazil, india, and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during june 2015. on average during june 2015, there were 688 million mobile-only daus, increasing 41% from 488 million mobile-only daus during the same period in 2014. the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.22•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our messenger app (and is also a registered facebook user), or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.    as of june 30, 2015, we had 1.49 billion maus, an increase of 13% from june 30, 2014. users in india, thailand, and the united states represented key sources of growth in the second quarter of 2015 relative to the same period in 2014. overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in june 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.23•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger app (and is also a registered facebook user) during the period of measurement. we define a mobile-only mau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement, whereas a mobile mau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement.worldwide mobile maus increased 23% to 1.31 billion as of june 30, 2015 from 1.07 billion as of june 30, 2014. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth in the second quarter of 2015. there were 655 million mobile-only maus as of june 30, 2015, increasing 64% from 399 million mobile-only maus during the same period in 2014. the remaining 659 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during june 2015. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.24trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users. for example, arpu for an average user in the second quarter of 2015 in the united states & canada region was more than seven times higher than for an average user in the asia-pacific region.note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 25during the second quarter of 2015, worldwide arpu was $2.76, an increase of 23% from the second quarter of 2014. over this period, arpu increased by 44% in united states & canada, 19% in asia-pacific, 18% in europe, and 5% in rest of world. the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the second quarter of 2014 to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on the growth rate of our arpu outside the united states and canada region. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia-pacific and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.26components of results of operationsrevenuewe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers.advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties, including our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action.payments and other fees. we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include people-, marketer-, and developer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include professional and legal services. general and administrative expenses also include depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets we have acquired.27results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of income

first six months of 2015 increased $1.13 billion or 39%, and $2.17 billion, or 40%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2014. the increases were primarily due to increases in advertising revenue.the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices. news feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement, and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. for the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented 76% and 74%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with 62% and 60% in the same periods in 2014.other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) certain product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads, and (iii) an increase in user growth and engagement. during the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, as compared to the same periods in 2014, the average price per ad increased by 220% and 251%, respectively, and the number of ads delivered decreased by 55% and 59%, respectively. the 29increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-news feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed. the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.payments and other fees revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015 decreased $19 million, or 8%, and $29 million, or 6%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2014. the decreases were primarily due to decreases in payments revenue from games played on personal computers. facebook usage on personal computers has been declining and will continue to decline in the future, resulting in a decline in our payments revenue. these decreases were partially offset by increases in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.foreign exchange impact on revenuethe general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the euro) from the second quarter and the first six months of 2014 to the same periods in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2015 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue would have been $4.37 billion and $8.11 billion, respectively, and our advertising revenue would have been $4.16 billion and $7.66 billion, respectively, which are $332 million and $520 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2015, respectively.cost of revenue three months ended june 30,   six months ended june

first six months of 2015 decreased $41 million and $53 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2014, primarily due to decreases in income before provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate in the second quarter was flat, compared to the same period in 2014. our effective tax rate increased in the first six months of 2015 compared, to the same period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in non-deductible share-based compensation related to acquisitions.our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the effect of non-deductible share-based compensation and the impact of acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions. our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing, size, and integration of any acquisitions we make.32liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $14.13 billion as of june 30, 2015, an increase of $2.93 billion from december 31, 2014, primarily due to $3.58 billion of cash generated from operations and $809 million in excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, partially offset by $1.05 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $282 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets.  in august 2013, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 revolving credit facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15, 2018. as of june 30, 2015, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. as of june 30, 2015, $1.52 billion of the $14.13 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary. these subsidiaries have historically incurred losses; as such, repatriating the funds will likely incur no residual tax liability. we have provided for residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary, however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant. we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2015 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $1.46 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $916 million. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was mostly due to an increase in net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above. cash used in investing activitiescash flow from investing activities during the first six months of 2015 primarily consisted of purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets. the increase in cash used in investing activities during the first six months of 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to $679 million increase in net purchases of marketable securities, and to a lesser extent, an increase in acquisition of businesses and purchases of intangible assets. in addition, there was an increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of server network infrastructure, data center construction, and office buildings. we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2015 of approximately $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion. cash provided by financing activitiescash flow from financing activities during the first six months of 2015 primarily consisted of excess tax benefits from share-based award activity and principal payments on capital lease obligations. the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was mostly due to decreased excess tax benefit from stock award activities and $12 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement of whatsapp's vested merger consideration, partially offset by lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions.off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2015.contractual obligationsthere were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2014.33contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 9 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding these contingencies.recent accounting pronouncementin may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. in july 2015, the fasb decided to delay the effective date of asu 2014-09 by one year. the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. as such, the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. we are still evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2014. 34
