the factors that are important to you. our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update our forward-35table of contentslooking statements.in this report, references to the “company,” “mastercard,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to the mastercard brand generally, and to the business conducted by mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including our operating subsidiary, mastercard international incorporated (d/b/a mastercard worldwide).overviewmastercard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a critical economic link among financial institutions, businesses, merchants, cardholders and governments worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. we provide a variety of services in support of the credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs of approximately 21,000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers. we primarily:•offer a wide range of payment solutions, which enable our customers to develop and implement credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs for their customers (which include cardholders, businesses and government entities),•manage a family of well-known, widely accepted payment card brands, including mastercard, maestro and cirrus, which we license to our customers for use in their payment programs,•process payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network,•provide support services to our customers and, depending upon the service, merchants and other clients, and•as part of managing our brands and our franchise, establish and enforce a common set of standards for adherence by our customers for the efficient and secure use of our payment card network.we generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands. cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands.we believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper-based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment, such as payment card transactions, creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business over the longer term. our focus is on continuing to:•grow our offerings by extending our strength in our core businesses globally, including credit, debit, prepaid and processing payment transactions over the mastercard worldwide network,•diversify our business by seeking new areas of growth in markets around the world, expanding points of acceptance for our brands in new geographies, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance, and working with new business partners such as merchants, government agencies and telecommunications companies, and•build new businesses through continued strategic efforts with respect to innovative payment methods, such as electronic commerce (e-commerce) and mobile capabilities.see “-business environment” for a discussion of environmental considerations related to our long-term strategic objectives.we recorded net income of $717 million, or $5.63 per diluted share, and $1,887 million, or $14.66 per diluted share, for the three months and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus net income of $518 million, or $3.94 per diluted share, and net income of $1,431 million, or $10.89 per diluted share, for the three months and nine months ended september 30, 2010, respectively. as of september 30, 2011, our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and current available-for-sale securities and $6.0 billion in equity. in addition, we generated cash flows from operations of $1,900 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2011.our net revenues increased 27.3% and 21.6% for the three months and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2010, primarily due to the increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions. the net foreign currency impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real had a favorable impact on net revenues of approximately 4 and 3 percentage points for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively.our revenues depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. changes in cardholder spending behavior, influenced by economic conditions, impact our ability to grow our revenues. our revenues are 36table of contentsprimarily based on transactions and volumes, which are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction. for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, volume-based revenues (domestic assessments and cross-border volume fees) and transaction-based revenues (transaction processing fees) increased compared to the three and nine months ended september 30, 2010. for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, our processed transactions increased 20.5% and 16.5%, respectively, and on a local currency basis our volumes increased 18.1% and 16.0%, respectively. this compares to increased processed transactions of 0.6% and 1.7% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2010, respectively, and increased volumes of 8.1% and 8.4% on a local currency basis for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2010, respectively. the net effects of pricing actions contributed approximately 1 and 3 percentage points to our net revenue growth for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively. overall, net revenue growth for the three and nine months months ended september 30, 2011 was moderated by an increase in rebates and incentives relating to customer and merchant agreement activity.our operating expenses increased 23.1% and 18.0% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2010. the increase was primarily due to greater general and administrative expenses, due to personnel expenses and professional fees, including expenses related to recent acquisitions. the net foreign currency impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and the brazilian real unfavorably impacted expenses by approximately 2 percentage points for each of the three and nine month periods ended september 30, 2011.our ratios of operating income as a percentage of net revenues, or operating margins, were 55.1% and 54.6% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus 53.6% and 53.2% for the comparable periods in 2010.the effective income tax rates were 30.5% and 31.6% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus 32.3% and 34.2% for the comparable periods in 2010.on december 9, 2010, mastercard entered into an agreement to acquire the prepaid card program management operations of travelex holdings ltd., since renamed access prepaid worldwide (“access”). pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, the company acquired access on april 15, 2011, at a purchase price of 295 million u.k. pound sterling, or $481 million, including adjustments for working capital, with contingent consideration (an “earn-out”) of up to an additional 35 million u.k. pound sterling, or approximately $57 million, if certain performance targets are met. see note 2 (acquisition of card program management operations) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for an earn-out performance target estimate as of september 30, 2011.access manages and delivers consumer and corporate prepaid travel cards through business partners around the world, including financial institutions, retailers, travel agents and foreign exchange bureaus. the acquisition of access is an expansion of our business into program management services. the acquisition is intended to enable us to offer end-to-end prepaid card solutions encompassing branded switching, issuing, processing and program management services, initially focused on the travel sector and in markets outside the united states.business environmentwe process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. net revenue generated in the united states was 38.4% and 39.4% of total net revenue for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus 41.1% and 41.8%, in the comparable periods in 2010. no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period, but differences in market maturity, economic health, price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time. while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. unprecedented events which began during 2008 impacted the financial markets around the world, including continued distress in the credit environment, continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention. in particular, the economies of the united states and the united kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil, and it has also impacted other economies around the world. countries that have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies include several in europe and the united states. some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments. many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence, including potential further changes in laws and regulations. many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted.37table of contentsmastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to an economic crisis and the state of economic environments. the severity of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present. as a result, our revenue growth may be negatively impacted, or the company may be impacted in several ways, including but not limited to the following:•declining economies, foreign currency fluctuations and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors; for example, a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on cross-border travel patterns, which may continue to change.•constriction of consumer and business confidence, such as in recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high unemployment, may cause decreased spending by cardholders.•our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults.•uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our customers’ businesses may make estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives and realization of prepaid assets less predictable.•our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability.•our customers may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services.•government intervention, including the effect of laws, regulations and/or government investments in our customers, may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products.•tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility.•our customers may default on their settlement obligations. see note 20 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 for further discussion of our settlement exposure.•our business and prospects, as well as our revenue and profitability, could be materially and adversely affected by consolidation of our customers. see “additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers, resulting in lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability” in part i, item 1a (risk factors) of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2010 for further discussion.in addition, our business and our customers’ businesses are subject to regulation in many countries. regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. see note 19 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report and part i, item 1a (risk factors) of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2010 for further discussion. in particular, in july 2010, the united states enacted into law the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the “dodd-frank act”), in accordance with which the united states federal reserve board promulgated rules related to debit cards and interchange fees in june 2011, portions of which became effective on october 1, 2011. the rules revised earlier proposed rules provided by the federal reserve board in december 2010. see “risk factors – legal and regulatory risks – the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue, our prospects for future growth and our overall business, financial condition and results of operations” in part i, item 1a (risk factors) of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2010 for further discussion on the context of the dodd-frank act and both effective and pending regulations, including with respect to: (1) regulation providing for limitations on debit and prepaid “interchange transaction fees” and (2) regulation prohibiting exclusive debit network arrangements and routing restrictions for debit, as well as the creation of independent regulatory bodies (such as the financial stability oversight council) with the authority to regulate consumer financial products and, potentially, broader aspects of payment card network operations (e.g., the ability to deem mastercard “systemically important”). see also “risk factors – legal and regulatory risks – new regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products” in part i, item 1a, of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2010.mastercard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. for example, in our asia/38table of contentspacific and latin american regions, we have now experienced several quarters of significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the u.s. we have observed mixed economic indicators, including retail spending and unemployment rates. notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business.financial resultsour operating results for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011 and 2010 were as

overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real. the functional currency of mastercard europe, our principal european operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real. accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the u.s. dollar. during the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, the u.s. dollar weakened against both the euro and the brazilian real, versus the comparable periods in 2010. accordingly, the net foreign currency impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real had a favorable impact on net revenues by approximately 4 and 3 percentage points for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, while operating expenses were unfavorably impacted by approximately 2 percentage points for each of the three and nine month periods ended september 30, 2011.in addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives. in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. in europe, gev is calculated based on local 39table of contentscurrency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus most non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies. the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis. for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, gdv increased 23.4% and 20.9%, respectively, when measured on a u.s. dollar converted basis and increased 18.1% and 16.0%, respectively, when measured on a local currency basis, versus the comparable period in 2010.revenuesrevenue descriptionsmastercard’s business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders’ banks) and acquirers (the merchants’ banks). our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands, the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment-related services we provide to our customers. our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.we process transactions denominated in more than 150 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders with the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, mastercard cards across multiple country borders. we process most of the cross-border transactions using mastercard, maestro and cirrus-branded cards and, among our largest markets, process the majority of mastercard-branded domestic transactions in the united states, united kingdom, canada and brazil.our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes, types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers. a combination of the following factors determines the pricing:•domestic or cross-border•signature-based (credit and off-line debit) or pin-based (on-line debit, including automated teller machine (“atm”) cash withdrawals and retail purchases)•tiered pricing, with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume/transaction hurdles•geographic region or country•retail purchase or cash withdrawalcross-border transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees. we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and pricing may impact revenue growth in the future. in addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements.the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories:1.domestic assessments: domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the merchant country and the cardholder country are the same. a portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price. in addition, domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs. acceptance development fees are charged primarily to u.s. issuers based on components of volume, and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale.2.cross-border volume fees: cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the merchant country and the cardholder country are different. cross-border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage (purchases and cash disbursements) from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price. cross-border volume fees also include fees charged to issuers for performing currency conversion services.3.transaction processing fees: transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions. these fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service. transaction processing fees include charges 40table of contentsfor the following:•transaction switching – authorization, clearing and settlement.a.authorization refers to a process in which a transaction is approved by the issuer or, in certain circumstances such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer’s instructions or applicable rules. mastercard’s rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers.b.clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed. fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers.c.settlement refers to facilitating the exchange of funds between parties. fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers.•connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company’s network.4.other revenues: other revenues for other payment-related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors, such as contractual agreements. examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following:•fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions. this includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants.•cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with mastercard-branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines.•consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company’s professional advisory services group. the company’s business agreements with certain customers and merchants may include consulting services as an incentive. the contra-revenue associated with these incentives is included in rebates and incentives.•program management services provided to prepaid card issuers. this primarily includes foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees, and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards. see note 2 (acquisition of card program management operations) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 for further discussion.•the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related services, including rules compliance, account and transaction enhancement services, holograms and publications.5.rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue in the same period that performance occurs. performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive, including commitments to the agreement term, hurdles for volumes, transactions or issuance of new cards, launch of new programs, or the execution of marketing programs. rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance, the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements.revenue analysisgross revenues increased $432 million and $1,035 million, or 22.2% and 18.7%, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2010, primarily due to increased dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands and increased transactions. rebates and incentives increased $42 and $150 million, or 8.1% and 10.6%, for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2010. our net revenues increased 27.3% and 21.6% for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2010.our revenues are primarily based on transactions and volumes, which are impacted by the number of transactions and the dollar amount of each transaction. for the three months ended september 30, 2011, our processed transactions increased 20.5% and our volumes increased 18.1% on a local currency basis. for the nine months ended september 30, 2011, our processed 41table of contentstransactions increased 16.5% and our volumes increased 16.0% on a local currency basis. the effects of pricing actions implemented in 2010 and 2011 contributed approximately 1 and 3 percentage points to our net revenue growth for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2011, respectively. the pricing structure for our acquirer revenues from cross-border transactions was simplified in the fourth quarter of 2010. pursuant to the previous structure, mastercard charged a cross-border volume fee but provided a rebate if mastercard was allowed to perform the currency conversion. beginning in october 2010, if mastercard performs the currency conversion, the cross border volume fee charged is lower and no rebate is provided. this change had no impact to net revenues. recent acquisitions contributed approximately 4 and 3 percentage points to our net revenue growth for the three and nine month periods ended september 30, 2011, respectively.the significant components of our net revenues were as follows for the three and nine months ended september 30: for the threemonths endedseptember 30, dollarincrease2011 vs. 2010 percentincrease2011 vs. 2010 for

2010, respectively. the rate for the three months ended september 30, 2011 was lower than the rate for the three months ended september 30, 2010 primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings for the three months ended september 30, 2011. other tax benefits and charges in each period collectively had a minimal impact on the tax rate.the rate for the nine months ended september 30, 2011 was lower than the rate for the nine months ended september 30, 2010 primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings for the nine months ended september 30, 2011 and the recognition of discrete adjustments for the nine months ended september 30, 2010.in 2010, in connection with the expansion of the company's operations in the asia pacific, middle east and africa region, the company's subsidiary in singapore, mastercard asia pacific pte. ltd. (“mappl”) received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance, at the recommendation of the singapore economic development board. the incentive had provided mappl with, among other benefits, a 5% income tax rate for the 10-year period commencing january 1, 2010 on taxable income in excess of a base amount.  the company continued to explore business opportunities in this region, resulting in an expansion of the incentives being granted by the ministry of finance, including an income tax rate of 1% on taxable income in excess of a revised fixed base amount commencing july 1, 2011 and continuing through december 31, 2025.   liquidity and capital resourceswe need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures, to make continued investments in our business and to service our potential litigation obligations. at september 30, 2011 and december 31, 2010, we had $4.4 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and current available-for-sale securities to use for our operations. total equity was $6.0 billion and $5.2 billion as of september 30, 2011 and december 31, 2010, respectively.on december 9, 2010, mastercard entered into an agreement to acquire access. pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, the company acquired access on april 15, 2011 at a purchase price of 295 million u.k. pound sterling, or $481 million, including adjustments for working capital, with contingent consideration of up to an additional 35 million u.k. pound sterling, or approximately $57 million, if certain performance targets are met. see note 2 (acquisition of card program management operations) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.in september 2010, the company’s board of directors authorized a plan for the company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its class a common stock in open market transactions. the company did not repurchase any shares under this plan during 2010. in april 2011, the company’s board of directors amended the existing share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase an incremental $1 billion of its class a common stock in open market transactions. the incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization increases the class a share repurchase program to an aggregate of $2 billion. during the three months ended september 30, 2011, mastercard repurchased a total of approximately 0.3 million shares for $77 million at an average price of $308.01 per share of class a common stock. during the nine months ended september 30, 2011, mastercard repurchased a total of approximately 4.3 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average price of $257.12 per share of class a common stock. these repurchased shares are considered treasury stock. the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions.the company believes that its existing cash balances, its cash flow generating capabilities, its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential litigation obligations. cash and cash equivalents and current available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion  at september 30, 2011 and december 31, 2010, respectively, or 41% and 28% of our total cash and cash equivalents and current available-for-sale investment securities as of such dates. it is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated 45table of contentswith our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2010 outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 21 (income tax) to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2010), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings. if these earnings are needed for u.s operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states, the company would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation.our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. see item 1a (risk factors) in part 1 of the company’s annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2010. see also notes 17 (obligations

business continuity planning and related purposes, we may borrow and repay amounts under the credit facility from time to time. the facility fee and borrowing cost under the credit facility are contingent upon our credit rating. at september 30, 2011, the applicable facility fee was 20 basis points on the average daily commitment (whether or not utilized). in addition to the facility fee, interest on borrowings under the credit facility would be charged at the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus an applicable margin of 130 basis points or an alternate base rate plus 30 basis

property. our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements.3. amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the mastercard brand. the amounts included are fixed and non-cancelable. in addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing, computer hardware maintenance, software licenses and other service agreements. future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. mastercard has accrued $790 million as of september 30, 2011 related to customer and merchant agreements.4. includes current liability of $4 million relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the non-current liabilities for uncertainties in income taxes, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlements with the respective taxing authority.5. represents amounts due in accordance with litigation and regulatory settlements.recent accounting pronouncementsrevenue arrangements with multiple deliverables - in september 2009, the accounting standard for the allocation of revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables was amended. previous accounting standards required companies to allocate revenue based on the fair value of each deliverable, even though such deliverables may not be sold separately either by 47table of contentsthe company itself or other vendors. the new accounting standard eliminates (i) the residual method of revenue allocation and (ii) the requirement that all undelivered elements must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered. the company adopted the revised accounting standard effective january 1, 2011 via prospective adoption. the adoption did not have an impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations.fair value measurement - the company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when valuing liabilities, the company also considers the company's creditworthiness. the company classifies these recurring fair value measurements into a three-level hierarchy ("valuation hierarchy") and discloses the significant assumptions utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. in january 2010, fair value disclosure requirements were amended to require detailed disclosures about transfers to and from level 1 and 2 of the valuation hierarchy effective january 1, 2010 and disclosures regarding purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a "gross" basis within the level 3 (of the valuation hierarchy) reconciliation effective january 1, 2011. the company adopted the new guidance for disclosures about transfers to and from level 1 and 2 of the valuation hierarchy effective january 1, 2010. the adoption did not have an impact on the company's financial position or results of operations. the company adopted the guidance that requires disclosure of a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a "gross" basis within level 3 (of the valuation hierarchy) effective january 1, 2011, as required, and the adoption did not have an impact on the company's financial position or results of operations. in may 2011, the fair value accounting standard was amended to change fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements. the key changes in measurement principles include limiting the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise to nonfinancial assets, providing a framework for considering whether a premium or discount can be applied in a fair value measurement, and aligning the fair value measurement of instruments classified within an entity's shareholders' equity with the guidance for liabilities. disclosures will be required for all transfers between levels 1 and 2 within the valuation hierarchy, the use of a nonfinancial asset measured at fair value if its use differs from its highest and best use, the level in the valuation hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but for which fair value is required to be disclosed, and for level 3 measurements, quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements. the company will adopt the revised accounting standard effective january 1, 2012 via prospective adoption, as required, and does not anticipate that this adoption will have an impact on the company's financial position or results of operations. impairment testing for goodwill - in december 2010, a new accounting standard was issued. this standard requires step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to be performed for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. the provisions for this pronouncement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2010, with no early adoption permitted. the company adopted this accounting standard on january 1, 2011, and the adoption had no impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.in september 2011, a new accounting standard was issued.  this standard is intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment.  entities are permitted to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.  this standard is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.  the company plans to adopt the revised accounting standard effective october 1, 2011.  the adoption is not expected to have an impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.business combinations - in december 2010, a new accounting standard was issued. this standard requires a company to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period, only when comparative financial statements are presented. the disclosure provisions are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. the company adopted this accounting standard on january 1, 2011 for prospective application. the adoption had no impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.48table of contentscomprehensive income - in june 2011, a new accounting standard was issued. this standard amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income: (1) in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income. also, items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements. this standard requires retrospective application, and it is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. the company will adopt the revised accounting standard effective january 1, 2012, and does not anticipate that this adoption will have an impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations.
