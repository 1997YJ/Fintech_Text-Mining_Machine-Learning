references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement.  unless otherwise
indicated, references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate
and financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share
after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of third quarter 2014 results 
 
earnings
in the period rose 3 percent from the third quarter of 2013, driven by higher
margins and improved operations in the downstream and chemical businesses,
partially offset by the impact of lower upstream realizations. 
 
exxonmobil’s quarterly results
demonstrate the strength of our integrated business model. integration across
upstream, downstream and chemical gives us competitive advantages in scale,
efficiency, technical and commercial capabilities, regardless of market
fluctuations over the business cycle.



 


 


 



 
earnings
of $25,950 million in the first nine months of 2014 increased $1,720 million
from 2013.  
 
earnings per share – assuming
dilution for the first nine months of 2014 increased 11 percent to $6.04. 

 
capital and exploration
expenditures for the first nine months of 2014 were $28.1 billion, down
14 percent from 2013.
 
through the first nine months of
2014, the corporation distributed $17.6 billion to shareholders through
dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

upstream
earnings were $6,416 million in the third quarter of 2014, down
$297 million from the third quarter of 2013. lower realizations decreased
earnings by $670 million. favorable volume mix effects increased earnings
by $340 million. all other items increased earnings by $30 million.
 
on an oil‑equivalent basis,
production decreased 4.7 percent from the third quarter of 2013. excluding
the impact of the expiry of the abu dhabi onshore concession, production
decreased 1 percent, with liquids up 0.6 percent and gas down
2.9 percent.
 
liquids production totaled
2,065 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 134 kbd from the third
quarter of 2013. the abu dhabi onshore concession expiry reduced volumes by
148 kbd. excluding this impact, liquids production was up slightly as
project ramp‑up and work programs more than offset field decline,
divestment impacts and higher downtime.
 
third quarter natural gas
production was 10,595 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), down
319 mcfd from 2013. field decline and lower entitlement volumes were
partly offset by new production from papua new guinea and work programs.
 
earnings from u.s. upstream
operations were $1,257 million, $207 million higher than the third
quarter of 2013. non‑u.s. upstream earnings were $5,159 million,
down $504 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings in the first nine months of 2014 were $22,080 million, up
$2,025 million from 2013. lower prices and volumes were more than offset
by favorable mix effects, increasing earnings by a net $470 million. all
other items, primarily asset sales, increased earnings by $1.6 billion.
 
on an oil‑equivalent basis,
production was down 5.3 percent compared to the same period in 2013.
excluding the impact of the expiry of the abu dhabi onshore concession,
production decreased 2 percent.
 
liquids production of
2,087 kbd decreased 105 kbd compared to 2013.  the abu dhabi onshore
concession expiry reduced volumes by 137 kbd. excluding this impact,
liquids production was up 1.5 percent, driven by project ramp‑up and
work programs.
 
natural gas production of
11,115 mcfd decreased 703 mcfd from 2013, as expected u.s. field
decline and lower european demand were partially offset by project ramp‑up
and work programs.
 
earnings from u.s. upstream
operations were $3,694 million, up $689 million from 2013. non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $18,386 million, up $1,336 million from the
prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s entitlement
volume effects.  these descriptions are provided to facilitate understanding of
the terms.
 
production sharing
contract (psc) net interest reductions are contractual reductions in exxonmobil’s share of production
volumes covered by pscs. these reductions typically occur when cumulative
investment returns or production volumes achieve thresholds as specified in the
pscs. once a net interest reduction has occurred, it typically will not be
reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
price and spend
impacts on volumes are fluctuations in exxonmobil’s share of production volumes
caused by changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to
another.  for example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for
exxonmobil to recover its costs. according to the terms of contractual
arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can
increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil.
these effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns
or market prices for crude oil or natural gas.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2014 was $12.5 billion,
including asset sales of $0.1 billion, and decreased $1.1 billion from the
comparable 2013 period primarily due to working capital changes.
 
cash provided by operating
activities totaled $37.7 billion for the first nine months of 2014, $3.0
billion higher than 2013. the major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $26.8 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion from the prior year
period.  the adjustment for the noncash provision of $12.8 billion for
depreciation and depletion was flat with 2013.  changes in operational working
capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2014 primarily due to increase
in inventory offset by payable balances.  changes in operational working
capital decreased cash flows by $2.7 billion in 2013, primarily due to an
increase in inventory.  all other items net decreased cash by $1.5 billion in
2014 and by $0.2 billion in 2013.  for additional details, see the condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2014 used net cash of $18.1 billion, a decrease of
$9.4 billion compared to the prior year.  spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $24.1 billion was $1.2 billion lower than 2013.  proceeds
from asset sales of $3.8 billion increased $2.9 billion.  additional investment
and advances decreased $2.4 billion to $1.3 billion reflecting the absence of
the 2013 acquisition of celtic exploration ltd.  other investing activities –
net increased $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion primarily reflecting the collection
of advances.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales for the first nine months of 2014 was $41.5 billion,
including asset sales of $3.8 billion, and increased $5.9 billion from the
comparable 2013 period due to higher proceeds from asset sales and the absence
of unfavorable 2013 working capital impacts.  
 
during the first
quarter of 2014, the corporation issued $5.5 billion of long-term debt and used
the proceeds to reduce short-term debt.  net cash used in financing activities
of $19.1 billion in the first nine months of 2014 was $7.8 billion higher than
2013 reflecting total debt reduction in 2014 and short-term debt issuance in
2013, partially offset by a lower level of purchases of shares of exxonmobil
stock in 2014.  
 
during the third
quarter of 2014, exxon mobil corporation purchased 30 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $3.0 billion.  these purchases
were to reduce the number of shares outstanding.  shares outstanding decreased
from 4,265 million at the end of the second quarter to 4,235 million at the end
of the third quarter 2014.  purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.


17  



 

the corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $5.9
billion in the third quarter of 2014 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.0 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2014 compared to
$5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2013.
 
total debt of $21.8
billion compared to $22.7 billion at year-end 2013.  the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 10.4 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2014
compared to 11.2 percent at year-end 2013.  
 
while the corporation issues long-term debt from time to time, the
corporation currently expects to cover its near-term financial requirements
predominantly with internally generated funds, supplemented by its revolving
commercial paper program.  
 
the corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program,
continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.  because of the
ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time
to time which will result in either gains or losses.  additionally, the
corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business
portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such
transactions from time to time.  key criteria for evaluating acquisitions
include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. 
acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s common stock,
or both.  
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

primarily to the absence of the $3.1 billion celtic exploration ltd.
acquisition. the corporation anticipates an average investment profile of about
$37 billion per year for the next several years. actual spending could vary
depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.
 
as noted
in item 1a of exxonmobil’s form 10-k for 2013, the corporation’s results can be
adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our
operations. these include restrictions on doing business in certain countries,
or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. as noted in
exxonmobil’s form 10-q for the quarter ended june 30, 2014, both the european
union (eu) and the united states (u.s.) have imposed sanctions against russia
relating to the situation in the ukraine. on september 12, 2014, the eu and
u.s. imposed additional sanctions relating to the russian energy sector. in
compliance with the sanctions and all general and specific licenses, prohibited
activities involving offshore russia in the black sea, arctic regions, and
onshore west siberia have been wound down.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the
financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue from
contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2017. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual results, including project plans, costs, timing, and
capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource recoveries; and
share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors including:
changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions affecting
the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of economic
recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts; changes in law
or government regulation, including tax and environmental requirements; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "factors
affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our website and in
item 1a of exxonmobil's 2013 form 10-k. we assume no duty to update these
statements as of any future date.
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.

references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement.  unless otherwise
indicated, references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate
and financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share
after excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of third quarter 2014 results 
 
earnings
in the period rose 3 percent from the third quarter of 2013, driven by higher
margins and improved operations in the downstream and chemical businesses,
partially offset by the impact of lower upstream realizations. 
 
exxonmobil’s quarterly results
demonstrate the strength of our integrated business model. integration across
upstream, downstream and chemical gives us competitive advantages in scale,
efficiency, technical and commercial capabilities, regardless of market
fluctuations over the business cycle.



 


 


 



 
earnings
of $25,950 million in the first nine months of 2014 increased $1,720 million
from 2013.  
 
earnings per share – assuming
dilution for the first nine months of 2014 increased 11 percent to $6.04. 

 
capital and exploration
expenditures for the first nine months of 2014 were $28.1 billion, down
14 percent from 2013.
 
through the first nine months of
2014, the corporation distributed $17.6 billion to shareholders through
dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding.

upstream
earnings were $6,416 million in the third quarter of 2014, down
$297 million from the third quarter of 2013. lower realizations decreased
earnings by $670 million. favorable volume mix effects increased earnings
by $340 million. all other items increased earnings by $30 million.
 
on an oil‑equivalent basis,
production decreased 4.7 percent from the third quarter of 2013. excluding
the impact of the expiry of the abu dhabi onshore concession, production
decreased 1 percent, with liquids up 0.6 percent and gas down
2.9 percent.
 
liquids production totaled
2,065 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 134 kbd from the third
quarter of 2013. the abu dhabi onshore concession expiry reduced volumes by
148 kbd. excluding this impact, liquids production was up slightly as
project ramp‑up and work programs more than offset field decline,
divestment impacts and higher downtime.
 
third quarter natural gas
production was 10,595 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per day), down
319 mcfd from 2013. field decline and lower entitlement volumes were
partly offset by new production from papua new guinea and work programs.
 
earnings from u.s. upstream
operations were $1,257 million, $207 million higher than the third
quarter of 2013. non‑u.s. upstream earnings were $5,159 million,
down $504 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings in the first nine months of 2014 were $22,080 million, up
$2,025 million from 2013. lower prices and volumes were more than offset
by favorable mix effects, increasing earnings by a net $470 million. all
other items, primarily asset sales, increased earnings by $1.6 billion.
 
on an oil‑equivalent basis,
production was down 5.3 percent compared to the same period in 2013.
excluding the impact of the expiry of the abu dhabi onshore concession,
production decreased 2 percent.
 
liquids production of
2,087 kbd decreased 105 kbd compared to 2013.  the abu dhabi onshore
concession expiry reduced volumes by 137 kbd. excluding this impact,
liquids production was up 1.5 percent, driven by project ramp‑up and
work programs.
 
natural gas production of
11,115 mcfd decreased 703 mcfd from 2013, as expected u.s. field
decline and lower european demand were partially offset by project ramp‑up
and work programs.
 
earnings from u.s. upstream
operations were $3,694 million, up $689 million from 2013. non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $18,386 million, up $1,336 million from the
prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s entitlement
volume effects.  these descriptions are provided to facilitate understanding of
the terms.
 
production sharing
contract (psc) net interest reductions are contractual reductions in exxonmobil’s share of production
volumes covered by pscs. these reductions typically occur when cumulative
investment returns or production volumes achieve thresholds as specified in the
pscs. once a net interest reduction has occurred, it typically will not be
reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
price and spend
impacts on volumes are fluctuations in exxonmobil’s share of production volumes
caused by changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to
another.  for example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for
exxonmobil to recover its costs. according to the terms of contractual
arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can
increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil.
these effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns
or market prices for crude oil or natural gas.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the third quarter of 2014 was $12.5 billion,
including asset sales of $0.1 billion, and decreased $1.1 billion from the
comparable 2013 period primarily due to working capital changes.
 
cash provided by operating
activities totaled $37.7 billion for the first nine months of 2014, $3.0
billion higher than 2013. the major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling
interests of $26.8 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion from the prior year
period.  the adjustment for the noncash provision of $12.8 billion for
depreciation and depletion was flat with 2013.  changes in operational working
capital decreased cash flows by $0.5 billion in 2014 primarily due to increase
in inventory offset by payable balances.  changes in operational working
capital decreased cash flows by $2.7 billion in 2013, primarily due to an
increase in inventory.  all other items net decreased cash by $1.5 billion in
2014 and by $0.2 billion in 2013.  for additional details, see the condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first nine months of 2014 used net cash of $18.1 billion, a decrease of
$9.4 billion compared to the prior year.  spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $24.1 billion was $1.2 billion lower than 2013.  proceeds
from asset sales of $3.8 billion increased $2.9 billion.  additional investment
and advances decreased $2.4 billion to $1.3 billion reflecting the absence of
the 2013 acquisition of celtic exploration ltd.  other investing activities –
net increased $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion primarily reflecting the collection
of advances.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales for the first nine months of 2014 was $41.5 billion,
including asset sales of $3.8 billion, and increased $5.9 billion from the
comparable 2013 period due to higher proceeds from asset sales and the absence
of unfavorable 2013 working capital impacts.  
 
during the first
quarter of 2014, the corporation issued $5.5 billion of long-term debt and used
the proceeds to reduce short-term debt.  net cash used in financing activities
of $19.1 billion in the first nine months of 2014 was $7.8 billion higher than
2013 reflecting total debt reduction in 2014 and short-term debt issuance in
2013, partially offset by a lower level of purchases of shares of exxonmobil
stock in 2014.  
 
during the third
quarter of 2014, exxon mobil corporation purchased 30 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $3.0 billion.  these purchases
were to reduce the number of shares outstanding.  shares outstanding decreased
from 4,265 million at the end of the second quarter to 4,235 million at the end
of the third quarter 2014.  purchases may be made in both the open market and
through negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.


17  



 

the corporation distributed to shareholders a total of $5.9
billion in the third quarter of 2014 through dividends and share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding.
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $5.0 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2014 compared to
$5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2013.
 
total debt of $21.8
billion compared to $22.7 billion at year-end 2013.  the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 10.4 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2014
compared to 11.2 percent at year-end 2013.  
 
while the corporation issues long-term debt from time to time, the
corporation currently expects to cover its near-term financial requirements
predominantly with internally generated funds, supplemented by its revolving
commercial paper program.  
 
the corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program,
continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade.  because of the
ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time
to time which will result in either gains or losses.  additionally, the
corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business
portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such
transactions from time to time.  key criteria for evaluating acquisitions
include potential for future growth and attractive current valuations. 
acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the corporation’s common stock,
or both.  
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

nine months of 2014, a decrease of $2.2 billion from 2013.  income tax expense decreased
by $2.2 billion to $16.0 billion as a result of a lower effective tax rate.  the
effective income tax rate was 43 percent compared to 48 percent in the prior
year due primarily to impacts related to the
corporation’s asset management program.  sales-based and all other taxes
were flat at $50.0 billion.

capital and exploration expenditures in the first nine months of
2014 were $28.1 billion, down 14 percent from the first nine months of 2013 due
primarily to the absence of the $3.1 billion celtic exploration ltd.
acquisition. the corporation anticipates an average investment profile of about
$37 billion per year for the next several years. actual spending could vary
depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the

recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2017. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial statements.
