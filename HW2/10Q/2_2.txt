billion.•capital expenditures were $7.3 billion.•number of employees was 85,050 as of march 31, 2018.information about segmentswe operate our business in multiple operating segments. google is our only reportable segment. none of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as other bets.our reported segments are:•google – google includes our main products such as ads, android, chrome, commerce, google cloud, google maps, google play, hardware (including nest), search, and youtube. our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in google. google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for google cloud offerings. •other bets – other bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. other bets includes businesses such as access, calico, capitalg, chronicle, gv, verily, waymo, and x. revenues from the other bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and tv services through access as well as licensing and r&d services through verily. in q1 2018, nest joined forces with google’s hardware team. consequently, the financial results of nest have been reported in the google segment, with nest revenues reflected in google other revenues. prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation. consolidated financial results are not affected.please refer to note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for further information. 30table of contentsalphabet inc.revenuesthe following table presents our revenues, by segment and revenue source (in millions, unaudited): three months ended march

assessing our advertising revenues performance, historically we presented the percentage change in the number of paid clicks and cost-per-click for both our google properties and our google network members’ properties (network) revenues. as our impression-based revenues have become a more significant driver of network revenues growth, the percentage change in paid clicks and cost-per-click cover less of our total network revenues. as a result, in q1 2018, we transitioned our network revenue metrics from the percentage change in paid clicks and cost-per-click to the percentage change in impressions and cost-per-impression. click-based revenues generated by our network business are included in impression-based metrics, so that these metrics cover nearly all of our network business. the monetization metrics for google properties revenues remain unchanged.paid clicks for our google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including gmail, google maps, and google play; and viewed youtube engagement ads. impressions for our google network members' properties include impressions displayed to users served on google network members' properties participating primarily in admob, adsense for content, adsense for search, and doubleclick adexchange. cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.as our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks on our google properties and the number of impressions on google network members’ properties and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity on our google properties and the revenues generated by impression activity on google network members’ properties.31table of contentsalphabet inc.our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on google network members' properties and the correlation between these items, have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•changes in device mix;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•general economic conditions;•growth rates of revenues within google properties;•seasonality; and•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.our advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels, changes in our product mix, increasing competition, query growth rates, our investments in new business strategies, shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues, and the evolution of the online advertising market. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.google propertiesthe following table presents our google properties revenues (in millions, unaudited), and changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage): three months

change  (19)%google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues that are generated on:•google search properties which includes revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.; and•other google owned and operated properties like gmail, google maps, google play, and youtube.our google properties revenues increased $4,595 million from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. we also experienced growth in desktop search due to improvements in ad formats and delivery, as well as growth in youtube driven primarily by video advertising. additionally, the growth was favorably affected by the general weakening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on google properties increased from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018 due to growth in youtube engagement ads, increases in mobile search queries, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base. the positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. the decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.32table of contentsalphabet inc.google network members' propertiesthe following table presents our

ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the growth was primarily driven by strength in both programmatic advertising buying and admob as well as the general weakening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. these increases were offset by a decline in our traditional adsense businesses.the impressions from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018 were relatively unchanged, with growth in both admob and programmatic advertising buying offset by a decrease from our traditional adsense for content business due to changes in product mix resulting from ongoing product changes. the changes in cost-per-impression were primarily due to ongoing product and policy changes and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery and were also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.google other

quarterly report on form 10-q.use of constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growththe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. our international revenues are favorably affected as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected as the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. our international revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses.we use non-gaap constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to gaap results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.34table of contentsalphabet inc.the following table presents the foreign exchange effect on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, unaudited): three months

strengthening relative to the argentine peso.35table of contentsalphabet inc.costs and expensescost of revenuescost of revenues consists of tac which are paid to google network members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. the cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on google network members' properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network members’ properties are paid as tac to our google network members.additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding tac) includes the following:•amortization of certain intangible assets;•content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);•credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; •expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including sbc), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and•inventory related costs for hardware we sell. the following tables present our cost

revenues increased $3,672 million from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the increase was due to an increase in tac of $1,659 million. the increase in tac to distribution partners was a result of an increase in google properties revenues and the associated tac rate. the increase in tac to google network members was a result of an increase in google network members' properties revenues and the associated tac rate. the increase in the google properties tac rate was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher tac because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. the increase in the network members tac rate was driven by the ongoing shift in advertising buying from our traditional 36table of contentsalphabet inc.network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher tac. the increase in the aggregate tac rate was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from google network members' properties to google properties.other cost of revenues increased $2,013 million from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the increase was due to various factors, including an increase in data center and other operations costs, which include depreciation, compensation expenses (including sbc), energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs as a result of business growth and increased allocations primarily from general and administrative expenses; content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube; and hardware related costs.we expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:•google network members tac rates, which are affected by the ongoing shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher tac;•google properties tac rates, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•growth rates of expenses associated with our data centers and other operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory and related costs;•increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, whose costs of revenues are generally higher in relation to our advertising revenues; and•relative revenue growth rates of google properties and our google network members' properties.research and developmentthe following table presents our r&d expenses (in millions, unaudited): three months ended march

from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses (including sbc) and facilities-related costs of $751 million, largely resulting from a 17% increase in headcount. in addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $287 million.we expect that r&d expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.sales and marketingthe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses (in millions,

three months ended march 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $429 million, largely resulting from increases in marketing and promotion-related expenses for our cloud offerings and hardware products. in addition, there was an increase in compensation expenses (including sbc) and facilities-related costs of $333 million, largely resulting from a 6% increase in headcount, and an increase in professional services fees of $115 million primarily due to additional expenses incurred for outsourced services. we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.general and administrativethe following table presents our general and

information technology consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.general and administrative expenses increased $234 million from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses (including sbc) and facilities-related costs of $615 million, largely resulting from accrued performance fees primarily related to gains on equity securities. the increase was offset by reduced allocations (with a corresponding net increase primarily in cost of revenues) and total legal settlement gain of $195 million.we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in future periods.other income (expense), netthe following

$2,644 million of unrealized gains related to observable price changes on equity securities as a result of the adoption of asu 2016-01. we expect other income (expense), net, will fluctuate in dollar amount and percentage of revenues in future periods as it is largely driven by market dynamics.38table of contentsalphabet inc.provision for income taxesthe following table presents our provision for

taxes and our effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the decrease is primarily due to a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to gains on equity securities; and the tax act that became effective in 2018.our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.capital resources and liquidityas of march 31, 2018, we had $102.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. from time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.on december 22, 2017, the tax act was enacted and we recorded a tax liability for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings of $10.2 billion, of which $890 million and $9.3 billion were presented within “income tax payable, current” and “income tax payable, non-current,” respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets as of march 31, 2018. as permitted by the tax act, we intend to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018.our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. as of march 31, 2018, we had $1.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding. we have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in february 2021. the interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. as of march 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. as of march 31, 2018, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $3.9 billion.in october 2016, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7.0 billion of its class c capital stock, which was completed during the three months ended march 31, 2018. in january 2018, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $8.6 billion of its class c capital stock. the repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans. the repurchase program does not have an expiration date. during the three months ended march 31, 2018, we repurchased and subsequently retired 2.0 million shares of alphabet class c capital stock for an aggregate amount of $2.2 billion.for the three months ended march 31, 2017 and 2018, our cash flows were as follows (in millions, unaudited): three months ended march

properties. additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for google cloud offerings.our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our google network members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. in addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware inventory costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.net cash provided by operating activities increased from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in cash received from advertising revenues and google other revenues (net of payouts to app developers) offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.cash used in investing activitiescash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable and non-marketable securities, and payments for acquisitions.net cash used in investing activities increased from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in purchases of property and equipment, including the purchase of the chelsea market building, and increases in payments for acquisitions. these increases were offset by decreases in purchase of marketable securities and decreases in maturities and sales of marketable securities.cash used in financing activitiescash provided by or used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt.net cash used in financing activities increased from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in repurchase of capital stock and increases in net payments related to stock-based award activities, offset by increases in net proceeds from the issuance of debt.contractual obligationswe had short-term and long-term taxes payable of $10.2 billion as of march 31, 2018 related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the tax act. for further information on the tax act, see note 13. in addition, we had long-term taxes payable of $3.5 billion as of march 31, 2018 primarily related to uncertain tax positions, for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.critical accounting policies and estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. in some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. in some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.impairment of securitieswe periodically review our debt securities for impairment. if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. if any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.40table of contentsalphabet inc.our equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried at fair value or under the measurement alternative with changes recognized in net income upon the adoption of asu 2016-01 on january 1, 2018. under the measurement alternative, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date. we review impairment of those equity securities at each reporting period end when there are qualitative indicators that may reduce the carrying value. once the qualitative indicators are identified and the fair value of the securities are less than carrying value, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.see note 1 of part i, item 1 of this

is our only reportable segment. none of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as other bets.our reported segments are:•google – google includes our main products such as ads, android, chrome, commerce, google cloud, google maps, google play, hardware (including nest), search, and youtube. our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in google. google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for google cloud offerings. •other bets – other bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. other bets includes businesses such as access, calico, capitalg, chronicle, gv, verily, waymo, and x. revenues from the other bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and tv services through access as well as licensing and r&d services through verily. in q1 2018, nest joined forces with google’s hardware team. consequently, the financial results of nest have been reported in the google segment, with nest revenues reflected in google other revenues. prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current period segment presentation. consolidated financial results are not affected.please refer to note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q

assessing our advertising revenues performance, historically we presented the percentage change in the number of paid clicks and cost-per-click for both our google properties and our google network members’ properties (network) revenues. as our impression-based revenues have become a more significant driver of network revenues growth, the percentage change in paid clicks and cost-per-click cover less of our total network revenues. as a result, in q1 2018, we transitioned our network revenue metrics from the percentage change in paid clicks and cost-per-click to the percentage change in impressions and cost-per-impression. click-based revenues generated by our network business are included in impression-based metrics, so that these metrics cover nearly all of our network business. the monetization metrics for google properties revenues remain unchanged.paid clicks for our google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including gmail, google maps, and google play; and viewed youtube engagement ads. impressions for our google network members' properties include impressions displayed to users served on google network members' properties participating primarily in admob, adsense for content, adsense for search, and doubleclick adexchange. cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.as our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks on our google properties and the number of impressions on google network members’ properties and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity on our google properties and the revenues generated by impression activity on google network members’ properties.31table of contentsalphabet inc.our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on google network members' properties and the correlation between these items, have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•changes in device mix;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•general economic conditions;•growth rates of revenues within google properties;•seasonality; and•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.our advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels, changes in our product mix, increasing competition, query growth rates, our investments in new business strategies, shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues, and the evolution of the online advertising market. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.google propertiesthe following table presents our google properties revenues (in millions, unaudited), and changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage): three months

partners who use google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.; and•other google owned and operated properties like gmail, google maps, google play, and youtube.our google properties revenues increased $4,595 million from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. we also experienced growth in desktop search due to improvements in ad formats and delivery, as well as growth in youtube driven primarily by video advertising. additionally, the growth was favorably affected by the general weakening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on google properties increased from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018 due to growth in youtube engagement ads, increases in mobile search queries, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base. the positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. the decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.32table of contentsalphabet inc.google network members' propertiesthe following table presents our

u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. these increases were offset by a decline in our traditional adsense businesses.the impressions from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018 were relatively unchanged, with growth in both admob and programmatic advertising buying offset by a decrease from our traditional adsense for content business due to changes in product mix resulting from ongoing product changes. the changes in cost-per-impression were primarily due to ongoing product and policy changes and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery and were also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.google other

quarterly report on form 10-q.use of constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growththe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. our international revenues are favorably affected as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected as the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. our international revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses.we use non-gaap constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to gaap results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.34table of contentsalphabet inc.the following table presents the foreign exchange effect on our international revenues and total revenues (in millions, unaudited): three months

ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. the cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on google network members' properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues related to revenues generated from ads placed on google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network members’ properties are paid as tac to our google network members.additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding tac) includes the following:•amortization of certain intangible assets;•content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);•credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; •expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including sbc), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and•inventory related costs for hardware we sell. the following tables present our cost

revenues increased $3,672 million from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the increase was due to an increase in tac of $1,659 million. the increase in tac to distribution partners was a result of an increase in google properties revenues and the associated tac rate. the increase in tac to google network members was a result of an increase in google network members' properties revenues and the associated tac rate. the increase in the google properties tac rate was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher tac because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. the increase in the network members tac rate was driven by the ongoing shift in advertising buying from our traditional 36table of contentsalphabet inc.network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher tac. the increase in the aggregate tac rate was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from google network members' properties to google properties.other cost of revenues increased $2,013 million from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the increase was due to various factors, including an increase in data center and other operations costs, which include depreciation, compensation expenses (including sbc), energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs as a result of business growth and increased allocations primarily from general and administrative expenses; content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube; and hardware related costs.we expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:•google network members tac rates, which are affected by the ongoing shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying which carries higher tac;•google properties tac rates, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;•growth rates of expenses associated with our data centers and other operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory and related costs;•increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, whose costs of revenues are generally higher in relation to our advertising revenues; and•relative revenue

taxes and our effective tax rate decreased from the three months ended march 31, 2017 to the three months ended march 31, 2018. the decrease is primarily due to a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to gains on equity securities; and the tax act that became effective in 2018.our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.capital resources and liquidityas of march 31, 2018, we had $102.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. from time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.on december 22, 2017, the tax act was enacted and we recorded a tax liability for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings of $10.2 billion, of which $890 million and $9.3 billion were presented within “income tax payable, current” and “income tax payable, non-current,” respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets as of march 31, 2018. as permitted by the tax act, we intend to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018.our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. as of march 31, 2018, we had $1.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding. we have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in february 2021. the interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. as of march 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the credit

further information on the tax act, see note 13. in addition, we had long-term taxes payable of $3.5 billion as of march 31, 2018 primarily related to uncertain tax positions, for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.critical accounting policies and estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. in some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. in some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.impairment of securitieswe periodically review our debt securities for impairment. if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. if any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.40table of contentsalphabet inc.our equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried at fair value or under the measurement alternative with changes recognized in net income upon the adoption of asu 2016-01 on january 1, 2018. under the measurement alternative, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date. we review impairment of those equity securities at each reporting period end when there are qualitative indicators that may reduce the carrying value. once the qualitative indicators are identified and the fair value of the securities are less than carrying value, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.see note 1 of part i, item 1 of this
