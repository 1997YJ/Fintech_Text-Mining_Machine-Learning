item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.certain revenue information in the section entitled "—three and six months ended june 30, 2017 and 2016—revenue—foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.executive overview of second quarter resultsour key user metrics and financial results for the second quarter of 2017 are as follows:user growth:•daily active users (daus) were 1.32 billion on average for june 2017, an increase of 17% year-over-year.•monthly active users (maus) were 2.01 billion as of june 30, 2017, an increase of 17% year-over-year.financial results:•revenue was $9.32 billion, up 45% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $9.16 billion, up 47% year-over-year.•total costs and expenses were $4.92 billion.•income from operations was $4.40 billion.•net income was $3.89 billion with diluted earnings per share of $1.32.•capital expenditures were $1.44 billion.•effective tax rate was 13%.•cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $35.45 billion as of june 30, 2017.•headcount was 20,658 as of june 30, 2017, an increase of 43% year-over-year.in the second quarter of 2017, we announced our new mission, which is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. we also continued to focus on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping businesses expand their use of our mobile products, (ii) developing innovative ad products that help businesses get the most of their ad campaigns, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through our targeting capabilities and outcome-based measurement.we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the facebook app and platform, as well as video, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as instagram, messenger, and whatsapp, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives, such as artificial intelligence, connectivity, and virtual and augmented reality, that we believe will further our mission to build community and bring the world closer together. we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap, and we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2016. in addition, we anticipate our expenses in 2017 will continue to grow as we execute on priorities such as (i) hiring top engineering talent, (ii) investing in research and development, content, and sales and marketing efforts, and (iii) expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our growth.20trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daus, maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated. trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access facebook on mobile devices.•daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 21worldwide daus increased 17% to 1.32 billion on average during june 2017 from 1.13 billion during june 2016. we experienced growth in daus across major markets, including india, indonesia, and brazil. monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.as of june 30, 2017, we had 2.01 billion maus, an increase of 17% from june 30, 2016. users in india, indonesia, and brazil represented key sources of growth in the second quarter of 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.22trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in the second quarter of 2017 in the united states & canada region was more than nine times higher than in the asia-pacific region.note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. in late 2015, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide revenue, it did affect our attribution of revenue to different geographic regions. the fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and arpu amounts for all regions were adjusted to reflect this reclassification.23during the second quarter of 2017, worldwide arpu was $4.73, an increase of 24% from the second quarter of 2016. over this period, arpu increased by 35% in united states & canada, 33% in europe, 31% in rest of world, and 20% in asia-pacific. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.24components of results of operationsrevenueadvertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook, instagram, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.payments and other fees. we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales.cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, costs associated with partner arrangements, amortization of intangible assets, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.general and administrative. the majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include legal-related costs and professional services.25results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated

the first six months of 2017 increased $2.89 billion, or 45%, and $5.54 billion, or 47%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. the increases were due to increases in advertising revenue.the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed. for the second quarter and the first six months of 2017, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 87% and 86%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 84% and 83%, respectively, in the same periods in 2016. factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) an increase in users and their engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. however, we anticipate increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed will be a less significant driver of our revenue growth in the future.27during the second quarter and first six months of 2017, as compared to the same periods in 2016, the average price per ad increased by 24% and 19%, respectively, and the number of ads delivered increased by 19% and 25%, respectively. the increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory. the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product changes.payments and other fees revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 decreased $40 million, or 20%, and $46 million, or 12%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. the decreases in payments and other fees revenue were mostly due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers. we anticipate payments and other feesrevenue will continue to decline in 2017.foreign exchange impact on revenuethe general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2017 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the second quarter ended june 30, 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $9.46 billion and $9.31 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, both total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $141 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the second quarter of 2017. if we had translated revenue for the six months ended june 30, 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $17.52 billion and $17.18 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $164 million and $163 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the first six months of 2017.cost of revenue three months ended june 30,   six months ended june 30,   2017 2016 % change 2017 2016 % change (in millions, except for percentages)cost of

technical functions. in addition, our equipment and related expenses to support our research and development efforts increased in both the second quarter and the first six months of 2017, compared to

driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. in addition, for the first six months, such increase was partially offset by the foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.provision for income taxes three months ended june 30,   six months ended june 30,   2017 2016 % change 2017 2016 % change (in millions, except for percentages)provision for income taxes$594 $471 26% $938 $800 17%effective tax rate13% 17%   12% 17%  our provision for income taxes in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 increased $123 million, or 26%, and  $138 million, or 17%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016, mostly due to increases in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by decreases in the effective tax rates. 29our effective tax rates in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 decreased compared to the same periods in 2016, primarily due to increases in income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than that of the u.s. statutory rate where we plan to indefinitely reinvest a certain portion of those earnings, partially offset by decreases in the tax rate benefit from share-based compensation. in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $275 million and $577 million, respectively, and our effective tax rates by six and seven percentage points, respectively, as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. for comparison, in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $236 million and $462 million, respectively, and our effective tax rates by nine and ten percentage points, respectively, as compared to the tax rate without such benefits.effective tax rate items. our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the united states and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate where we plan to indefinitely reinvest a certain portion of those earnings, as well as a number of other factors, including tax benefits from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, the impact of new legislation, and timing and amount of discrete items.the portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. our ability to indefinitely reinvest those future earnings will depend upon the amount, location, and cost of deploying those earnings to where they are needed by the business.integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase following an acquisition and integration. the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contributions to income in subsequent periods. the tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period. if our stock price remains constant to the july 24, 2017 price, we expect that our third quarter and full year rates will be similar to the rate in the second quarter.unrecognized tax benefits. as of june 30, 2017, our net unrecognized tax benefits, which were accrued as current liabilities of $25 million and other liabilities of $2.63 billion, were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services, and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months.in july 2016, we received a statutory notice of deficiency (notice) from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the irs prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregated amount of approximately $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the notice. we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and penalties. if the irs prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. as of june 30, 2017, we have not resolved this matter and proceedings continue in the united states tax court. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations.we expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount for future quarters accrued will be similar to the second quarter and the first six months of 2017. absent any unanticipated event, we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2017.30liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government agency securities, u.s. government securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $35.45 billion as of june 30, 2017, an increase of $6.00 billion from december 31, 2016, mostly due to $10.42 billion of cash generated from operations, partially offset by $2.72 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $1.50 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $378 million for repurchases of our class a common stock.cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $1.36 billion for the first six months of 2017. as of june 30, 2017, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $3.74 billion, and we anticipate that none of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2017. as of june 30, 2017, we had $104 million of federal tax credits, of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2017.in may 2016, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $2.0 billion. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on may 20, 2021. as of june 30, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934 (exchange act). during the six months ended june 30, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 3 million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $408 million. in january 2017, we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. in the first six months of 2017, we paid $1.50 billion of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards.as of june 30, 2017, $9.91 billion of the $35.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided residual taxes for the portion of earnings in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest such earnings of the local subsidiary.we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2017 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $1.90 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.40 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was mostly due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization.cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities was $11.33 billion for the first six months of 2017, mostly due to $8.64 billion for net purchases of marketable securities, and $2.72 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. the increase in cash used in investing activities during the first six months of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to net purchases of marketable securities.we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2017 of approximately $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion.cash used in financing activitiescash used in financing activities during the first six months of 2017 mostly consisted of $1.50 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $378 million for repurchases of our class a common stock. the increase in cash used in financing activities during the first six months of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was mostly due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchases of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017, partially offset by the reduction in payments on capital lease and other financing obligations.31off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2017.contractual obligationsexcept as disclosed in note 8 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, there were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016.contingencieswe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 8 — commitments and contingencies and note 10 — income taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.recently issued accounting pronouncementsin may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date, which delays the effective date of asu 2014-09 by one year. the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net) (asu 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. the guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. the new standard further requires new disclosures about contracts with customers, including the significant judgments the registrant has made when applying the guidance. we will be adopting the new standard effective january 1, 2018. the new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. while we are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, related disclosures, and our internal controls over financial reporting, we do not expect the impact to be material.in february 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. we currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective january 1, 2019. while we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect our operating leases, as disclosed in note 8 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, will be subject to the new standard. we will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will increase our total assets and liabilities. in january 2017, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business (asu 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.in january 2017, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2017-04, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. under asu 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. this guidance will be 32effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016.33item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.certain revenue information in the section entitled "—three and six months ended june 30, 2017 and 2016—revenue—foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and six months ended june 30, 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.executive overview of second quarter resultsour key user metrics and financial results for the second quarter of 2017 are as follows:user growth:•daily active users (daus) were 1.32 billion on average for june 2017, an increase of 17% year-over-year.•monthly active users (maus) were 2.01 billion as of june 30, 2017, an increase of 17% year-over-year.financial results:•revenue was $9.32 billion, up 45% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $9.16 billion, up 47% year-over-year.•total costs and expenses were $4.92 billion.•income from operations was $4.40 billion.•net income was $3.89 billion with diluted earnings per share of $1.32.•capital expenditures were $1.44 billion.•effective tax rate was 13%.•cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $35.45 billion as of june 30, 2017.•headcount was 20,658 as of june 30, 2017, an increase of 43% year-over-year.in the second quarter of 2017, we announced our new mission, which is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. we also continued to focus on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping businesses expand their use of our mobile products, (ii) developing innovative ad products that help businesses get the most of their ad campaigns, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through our targeting capabilities and outcome-based measurement.we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the facebook app and platform, as well as video, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as instagram, messenger, and whatsapp, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives, such as artificial intelligence, connectivity, and virtual and augmented reality, that we believe will further our mission to build community and bring the world closer together. we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap, and we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2016. in addition, we anticipate our expenses in 2017 will continue to grow as we execute on priorities such as (i) hiring top engineering talent, (ii) investing in research and development, content, and sales and marketing efforts, and (iii) expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our growth.20trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daus, maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated. trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access facebook on mobile devices.•daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 21worldwide daus increased 17% to 1.32 billion on average during june 2017 from 1.13 billion during june 2016. we experienced growth in daus across major markets, including india, indonesia, and brazil. monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.as of june 30, 2017, we had 2.01 billion maus, an increase of 17% from june 30, 2016. users in india, indonesia, and brazil represented key sources of growth in the second quarter of 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.22trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in the second quarter of 2017 in the united states & canada region was more than nine times higher than in the asia-pacific region.note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. in late 2015, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide revenue, it did affect our attribution of revenue to different geographic regions. the fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and arpu amounts for all regions were adjusted to reflect this reclassification.23during the second quarter of 2017, worldwide arpu was $4.73, an increase of 24% from the second quarter of 2016. over this period, arpu increased by 35% in united states & canada, 33% in europe, 31% in rest of world, and 20% in asia-pacific. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.24components of results of operationsrevenueadvertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook, instagram, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.payments and other fees. we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales.cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, costs associated with partner arrangements, amortization of intangible assets, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.general and administrative. the majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include legal-related costs and professional services.25results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data: three months ended june 30, six months ended june

same periods in 2016. the increases were due to increases in advertising revenue.the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed. for the second quarter and the first six months of 2017, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 87% and 86%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 84% and 83%, respectively, in the same periods in 2016. factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) an increase in users and their engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. however, we anticipate increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed will be a less significant driver of our revenue growth in the future.27during the second quarter and first six months of 2017, as compared to the same periods in 2016, the average price per ad increased by 24% and 19%, respectively, and the number of ads delivered increased by 19% and 25%, respectively. the increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory. the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product changes.payments and other fees revenue in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 decreased $40 million, or 20%, and $46 million, or 12%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. the decreases in payments and other fees revenue were mostly due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers. we anticipate payments and other feesrevenue will continue to decline in 2017.foreign exchange impact on revenuethe general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2017 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the second quarter ended june 30, 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $9.46 billion and $9.31 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, both total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $141 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the second quarter of 2017. if we had translated revenue for the six months ended june 30, 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $17.52 billion and $17.18 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $164 million and $163 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the first six months of 2017.cost of revenue three months ended june 30,   six months ended june 30,   2017 2016 % change 2017 2016 % change (in millions, except

income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. in addition, for the first six months, such increase was partially offset by the foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.provision for income taxes three months ended june 30,   six months ended june 30,   2017 2016 % change 2017 2016 % change (in

of 2017 increased $123 million, or 26%, and  $138 million, or 17%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016, mostly due to increases in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by decreases in the effective tax rates. 29our effective tax rates in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 decreased compared to the same periods in 2016, primarily due to increases in income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than that of the u.s. statutory rate where we plan to indefinitely reinvest a certain portion of those earnings, partially offset by decreases in the tax rate benefit from share-based compensation. in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $275 million and $577 million, respectively, and our effective tax rates by six and seven percentage points, respectively, as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. for comparison, in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $236 million and $462 million, respectively, and our effective tax rates by nine and ten percentage points, respectively, as compared to the tax rate without such benefits.effective tax rate items. our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the united states and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate where we plan to indefinitely reinvest a certain portion of those earnings, as well as a number of other factors, including tax benefits from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, the impact of new legislation, and timing and amount of discrete items.the portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. our ability to indefinitely reinvest those future earnings will depend upon the amount, location, and cost of deploying those earnings to where they are needed by the business.integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase following an acquisition and integration. the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contributions to income in subsequent periods. the tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period. if our stock price remains constant to the july 24, 2017 price, we expect that our third quarter and full year rates will be similar to the rate in the second quarter.unrecognized tax benefits. as of june 30, 2017, our net unrecognized tax benefits, which were accrued as current liabilities of $25 million and other liabilities of $2.63 billion, were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services, and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months.in july 2016, we received a statutory notice of deficiency (notice) from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the irs prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregated amount of approximately $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the notice. we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and penalties. if the irs prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. as of june 30, 2017, we have not resolved this matter and proceedings continue in the united states tax court. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations.we expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount for future quarters accrued will be similar to the second quarter and the first six months of 2017. absent any unanticipated event, we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2017.30liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government agency securities, u.s. government securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $35.45 billion as of june 30, 2017, an increase of $6.00 billion from december 31, 2016, mostly due to $10.42 billion of cash generated from operations, partially offset by $2.72 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $1.50 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $378 million for repurchases of our class a common stock.cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $1.36 billion for the first six months of 2017. as of june 30, 2017, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $3.74 billion, and we anticipate that none of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2017. as of june 30, 2017, we had $104 million of federal tax credits, of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2017.in may 2016, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $2.0 billion. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on may 20, 2021. as of june 30, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934 (exchange act). during the six months ended june 30, 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 3 million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $408 million. in january 2017, we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. in the first six months of 2017, we paid $1.50 billion of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards.as of june 30, 2017, $9.91 billion of the $35.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided residual taxes for the portion of earnings in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest such earnings of the local subsidiary.we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2017 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $1.90 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.40 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was mostly due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization.cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities was $11.33 billion for the first six months of 2017, mostly due to $8.64 billion for net purchases of marketable securities, and $2.72 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. the increase in cash used in investing activities during the first six months of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to net purchases of marketable securities.we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2017 of approximately $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion.cash used in financing activitiescash used in financing activities during the first six months of 2017 mostly consisted of $1.50 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $378 million for repurchases of our class a common stock. the increase in cash used in financing activities during the first six months of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, was mostly due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchases of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017, partially offset by the reduction in payments on capital lease and other financing obligations.31off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2017.contractual obligationsexcept as disclosed in note 8 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, there were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016.contingencieswe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 8 — commitments and contingencies and note 10 — income taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.recently issued accounting pronouncementsin may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date, which delays the effective date of asu 2014-09 by one year. the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. in march 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net) (asu 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. the guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. the new standard further requires new disclosures about contracts with customers, including the significant judgments the registrant has made when applying the guidance. we will be adopting the new standard effective january 1, 2018. the new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. while we are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, related disclosures, and our internal controls over financial reporting, we do not expect the impact to be material.in february 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. we currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective january 1, 2019. while we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect our operating leases, as disclosed in note 8 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, will be subject to the new standard. we will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will increase our total assets and liabilities. in january 2017, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business (asu 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.in january 2017, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2017-04, intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. under asu 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. this guidance will be 32effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016.33
