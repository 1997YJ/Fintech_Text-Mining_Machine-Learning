references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and
financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of second quarter 2017 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
second quarter 2017 earnings of $3.4 billion, or $0.78 per diluted share,
compared with $1.7 billion a year earlier, as oil and gas realizations
increased and refining margins improved.
 
the
solid results across the corporation’s business segments were driven by higher
commodity prices and a continued focus on operations and business fundamentals.
the corporation’s job is to grow long‑term value by investing in exxonmobil’s
integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed regardless of market
conditions.



 


 


 



 
earnings
of $7.4 billion for the first six months of 2017 increased 110 percent
from $3.5 billion in 2016.
 
earnings
per share assuming dilution were $1.73.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $8.1 billion, down 21 percent from
2016.
 
oil‑equivalent
production was 4 million oil‑equivalent barrels per day, down 3 percent
from the prior year. excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil‑equivalent
production was flat with the prior year.
 
the
corporation distributed $6.4 billion in dividends to shareholders.

upstream
earnings were $1,184 million in the second quarter of 2017, up $890 million
from the second quarter of 2016. higher liquids and gas realizations increased earnings
by $890 million. lower liquids volume and mix effects decreased earnings
by $260 million due to lower sales from timing of liftings. higher gas
volumes and mix effects increased earnings by $120 million. all other
items, including lower expenses, increased earnings by $140 million.
 
on
an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 1 percent from the second
quarter of 2016. liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day,
down 61,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were
partly offset by increased project volumes and work programs. natural gas
production was 9.9 billion cubic feet per day, up 158 million cubic
feet per day from 2016 as project ramp‑up, primarily in australia, was
partly offset by field decline and lower demand.
 
u.s.
upstream results were a loss of $183 million in the second quarter of 2017,
compared to a loss of $514 million in the second quarter of 2016. non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $1,367 million, up $559 million from the prior
year period.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings were $3,436 million, up $3,218 million from the first half
of 2016. higher realizations increased earnings by $3.2 billion.
unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $320 million. all
other items increased earnings by $310 million, primarily due to lower
expenses partly offset by unfavorable tax items in the current year.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was
down 3 percent compared to 2016. liquids production of 2.3 million
barrels per day decreased 133,000 barrels per day as lower entitlements
and field decline were partly offset by increased project volumes and work
programs. natural gas production of 10.4 billion cubic feet per day
increased 168 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp‑up,
primarily in australia, was partly offset by field decline.
 
u.s.
upstream results were a loss of $201 million in 2017, compared to a loss
of $1,346 million in 2016. earnings outside the u.s. were $3,637 million,
up $2,073 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions
that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors include, but
are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program
activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime,
market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that
do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2017 was $7.1 billion,
including asset sales of $0.2 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $15.1 billion for the first six months of 2017, $5.8
billion higher than 2016. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $7.4 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the non-cash provision of $9.2 billion
for depreciation and depletion decreased by $0.4 billion. changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $0.2 billion in 2017 versus
a reduction of $1.7 billion in 2016. all other items net decreased cash flows
by $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to a reduction of $2.0 billion in 2016. for
additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on
page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first six months of 2017 used net cash of $6.6 billion, a decrease of
$0.9 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $6.0 billion was $2.9 billion lower than 2016. proceeds
from asset sales of $0.8 billion decreased $0.4 billion. additional investments
and advances were $1.8 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, and principally reflect
the deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration
payable as a result of the acquisition of interoil corporation. 
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2017 was $16.0 billion,
including asset sales of $0.8 billion, an increase of $5.4 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $8.3 billion in the first six months of 2017, an
increase of $7.1 billion from 2016 mainly reflecting the absence of the
corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion in long-term debt in the prior year. 
 
during the first six
months of 2017, exxon mobil corporation purchased 6 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.5 billion. these purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding increased
from 4,148 million at year-end to 4,237 million at the end of the second
quarter of 2017, mainly due to shares issued for the acquisitions of interoil
corporation and of companies that hold acreage in the permian basin. purchases
may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $3.3 billion to shareholders in the second quarter of
2017 through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2017 compared
to $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2016.


20



 

 
total debt at the end
of the second quarter of 2017 was $41.9 billion compared to $42.8 billion at
year-end 2016. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 18.4 percent
at the end of the second quarter of 2017 compared to 19.7 percent at year-end
2016.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.2 billion from 2016. income tax expense
increased by $0.2 billion to $0.9 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 31 percent compared to 40 percent in the prior
year period reflecting favorable one-time tax items. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties were
essentially unchanged.



 


 


 



 
income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $27.7 billion for the first
six months of 2017, an increase of $2.8 billion from 2016. income tax expense
increased by $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 35 percent compared to 31 percent in the prior
year period due a higher share of earnings in high tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties increased by
$0.7 billion to $25.0 billion as a result of higher sales realizations.
 
in the united states, the
corporation has various ongoing u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with
the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. the corporation
has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not
expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has
filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court
with respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution
of all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse
effect on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

capital and exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2017
were $3.9 billion, down 24 percent from the second quarter of 2016.



 


 


 



 
capital and
exploration expenditures in the first six months of
2017 were $8.1 billion, down 21 percent from the first six months of 2016 due
primarily to lower upstream major project spending. the corporation anticipates
an investment level of $22 billion in 2017. actual spending could vary
depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. 
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.
see part ii. other information, item 1. legal proceedings in this report for
information concerning a civil penalty assessment related to this matter which
the corporation is contesting.
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in
may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue
from contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. “sales and other operating
revenue” on the consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the
standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third
parties. this change in reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation
expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method, under
which prior years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on
the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018 results. the corporation
continues to evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to
have a material effect on the corporation’s financial statements. 
in
february 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, leases.
the standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be
recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. exxonmobil is
evaluating the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements and plans to adopt it in 2019. 
in march 2017, the financial accounting
standards board issued an accounting standards update, compensation –
retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic
pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the update
requires that the service cost component of net benefit costs be reported in
the same line in the income statement as other compensation costs and that the
other components of net benefit costs be presented separately from the service
cost component. additionally, only the service cost component of net benefit
costs will be eligible for capitalization. the update is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2018. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.

references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and
financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of second quarter 2017 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
second quarter 2017 earnings of $3.4 billion, or $0.78 per diluted share,
compared with $1.7 billion a year earlier, as oil and gas realizations
increased and refining margins improved.
 
the
solid results across the corporation’s business segments were driven by higher
commodity prices and a continued focus on operations and business fundamentals.
the corporation’s job is to grow long‑term value by investing in exxonmobil’s
integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed regardless of market
conditions.



 


 


 



 
earnings
of $7.4 billion for the first six months of 2017 increased 110 percent
from $3.5 billion in 2016.
 
earnings
per share assuming dilution were $1.73.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $8.1 billion, down 21 percent from
2016.
 
oil‑equivalent
production was 4 million oil‑equivalent barrels per day, down 3 percent
from the prior year. excluding entitlement effects and divestments, oil‑equivalent
production was flat with the prior year.
 
the
corporation distributed $6.4 billion in dividends to shareholders.

upstream
earnings were $1,184 million in the second quarter of 2017, up $890 million
from the second quarter of 2016. higher liquids and gas realizations increased earnings
by $890 million. lower liquids volume and mix effects decreased earnings
by $260 million due to lower sales from timing of liftings. higher gas
volumes and mix effects increased earnings by $120 million. all other
items, including lower expenses, increased earnings by $140 million.
 
on
an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 1 percent from the second
quarter of 2016. liquids production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day,
down 61,000 barrels per day as field decline and lower entitlements were
partly offset by increased project volumes and work programs. natural gas
production was 9.9 billion cubic feet per day, up 158 million cubic
feet per day from 2016 as project ramp‑up, primarily in australia, was
partly offset by field decline and lower demand.
 
u.s.
upstream results were a loss of $183 million in the second quarter of 2017,
compared to a loss of $514 million in the second quarter of 2016. non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $1,367 million, up $559 million from the prior
year period.



 


 


 



 
upstream
earnings were $3,436 million, up $3,218 million from the first half
of 2016. higher realizations increased earnings by $3.2 billion.
unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $320 million. all
other items increased earnings by $310 million, primarily due to lower
expenses partly offset by unfavorable tax items in the current year.
 
on
an oil‑equivalent basis, production of 4 million barrels per day was
down 3 percent compared to 2016. liquids production of 2.3 million
barrels per day decreased 133,000 barrels per day as lower entitlements
and field decline were partly offset by increased project volumes and work
programs. natural gas production of 10.4 billion cubic feet per day
increased 168 million cubic feet per day from 2016 as project ramp‑up,
primarily in australia, was partly offset by field decline.
 
u.s.
upstream results were a loss of $201 million in 2017, compared to a loss
of $1,346 million in 2016. earnings outside the u.s. were $3,637 million,
up $2,073 million from the prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions
that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors include, but
are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program
activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime,
market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that
do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2017 was $7.1 billion,
including asset sales of $0.2 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $15.1 billion for the first six months of 2017, $5.8
billion higher than 2016. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $7.4 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the non-cash provision of $9.2 billion
for depreciation and depletion decreased by $0.4 billion. changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $0.2 billion in 2017 versus
a reduction of $1.7 billion in 2016. all other items net decreased cash flows
by $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to a reduction of $2.0 billion in 2016. for
additional details, see the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on
page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first six months of 2017 used net cash of $6.6 billion, a decrease of
$0.9 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $6.0 billion was $2.9 billion lower than 2016. proceeds
from asset sales of $0.8 billion decreased $0.4 billion. additional investments
and advances were $1.8 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, and principally reflect
the deposit into escrow of the maximum potential contingent consideration
payable as a result of the acquisition of interoil corporation. 
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2017 was $16.0 billion,
including asset sales of $0.8 billion, an increase of $5.4 billion from the
comparable 2016 period primarily due to higher earnings.
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $8.3 billion in the first six months of 2017, an
increase of $7.1 billion from 2016 mainly reflecting the absence of the
corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion in long-term debt in the prior year. 
 
during the first six
months of 2017, exxon mobil corporation purchased 6 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.5 billion. these purchases
were made to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with the company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding increased
from 4,148 million at year-end to 4,237 million at the end of the second
quarter of 2017, mainly due to shares issued for the acquisitions of interoil
corporation and of companies that hold acreage in the permian basin. purchases
may be made both in the open market and through negotiated transactions, and
may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $3.3 billion to shareholders in the second quarter of
2017 through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.0 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2017 compared
to $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2016.


20



 

 
total debt at the end
of the second quarter of 2017 was $41.9 billion compared to $42.8 billion at
year-end 2016. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 18.4 percent
at the end of the second quarter of 2017 compared to 19.7 percent at year-end
2016.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $13.7 billion for the second
quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.2 billion from 2016. income tax expense
increased by $0.2 billion to $0.9 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 31 percent compared to 40 percent in the prior
year period reflecting favorable one-time tax items. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties were
essentially unchanged.



 


 


 



 
income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $27.7 billion for the first
six months of 2017, an increase of $2.8 billion from 2016. income tax expense
increased by $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 35 percent compared to 31 percent in the prior
year period due a higher share of earnings in high tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties increased by
$0.7 billion to $25.0 billion as a result of higher sales realizations.
 
in the united states, the
corporation has various ongoing u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with
the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. the corporation
has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not
expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has
filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court
with respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution
of all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse
effect on the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

capital and exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2017
were $3.9 billion, down 24 percent from the second quarter of 2016.



 


 


 



 
capital and
exploration expenditures in the first six months of
2017 were $8.1 billion, down 21 percent from the first six months of 2016 due
primarily to lower upstream major project spending. the corporation anticipates
an investment level of $22 billion in 2017. actual spending could vary
depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. 
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.
see part ii. other information, item 1. legal proceedings in this report for
information concerning a civil penalty assessment related to this matter which
the corporation is contesting.
 
recently issued accounting standards
 
in
may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue
from contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. “sales and other operating
revenue” on the consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the
standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third
parties. this change in reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation
expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method, under
which prior years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on
the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018 results. the corporation
continues to evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to
have a material effect on the corporation’s financial statements. 
in
february 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, leases.
the standard requires all leases with an initial term greater than one year be
recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease liability. exxonmobil is
evaluating the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements and plans to adopt it in 2019. 
in march 2017, the financial accounting
standards board issued an accounting standards update, compensation –
retirement benefits (topic 715): improving the presentation of net periodic
pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. the update
requires that the service cost component of net benefit costs be reported in
the same line in the income statement as other compensation costs and that the
other components of net benefit costs be presented separately from the service
cost component. additionally, only the service cost component of net benefit
costs will be eligible for capitalization. the update is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2018. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.
