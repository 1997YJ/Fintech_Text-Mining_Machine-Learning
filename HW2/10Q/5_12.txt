item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a. "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.overviewour mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. we build products that support our mission by creating utility for people, marketers, and developers:people. we enable people to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.marketers. we enable marketers to engage with more than 1.3 billion monthly active users (maus) on facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. developers. we enable developers to use facebook's developer services to build, grow and monetize their mobile and web applications more rapidly and successfully.we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers. during the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014, we recorded revenue of $3.20 billion and $8.62 billion, respectively, income from operations of $1.40 billion and $3.86 billion, respectively, and net income of $806 million and $2.24 billion, respectively. 22trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), mobile daus, maus, mobile maus and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram unless otherwise specifically stated. trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with facebook, on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey, asia includes all users in australia and new zealand, and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 23worldwide daus increased 19% to 864 million on average during september 2014 from 728 million during september 2013. we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india, brazil, and the united states. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in september 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia.•mobile daus. we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger app on a given day. worldwide mobile daus increased 39% to 703 million on average during september 2014 from 507 million during september 2013. in all regions, an increasing number of our daus are accessing facebook through mobile devices, with users in brazil, india, and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during september 2014 as compared to the same period during 2013. on average during the month ended september 30, 2014, there were 536 million daus who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website, increasing 54% from 347 million mobile-only daus during the same period in 2013. the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.24•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.    as of september 30, 2014, we had 1.35 billion maus, an increase of 14% from september 30, 2013. users in india and brazil represented key sources of growth in the third quarter of 2014 relative to the same period in 2013. overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in september 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia.25•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger app during the period of measurement. worldwide mobile maus increased 29% to 1.12 billion as of september 30, 2014 from 874 million as of september 30, 2013. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus are accessing facebook through mobile devices, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth over the third quarter of 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. there were 456 million mobile maus who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website during the month ended september 30, 2014, increasing 80% from 254 million during the same period in 2013. the remaining 668 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during september 2014. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.26trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users. for example, arpu for an average user in the third quarter of 2014 in united states & canada was more than six times higher than for an average user in asia.  note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 27during the third quarter of 2014, worldwide arpu was $2.40, an increase of 40% from the third quarter of 2013. over this period, arpu increased by approximately 52% in united states & canada, 46% in europe and asia, and 27% in rest of world. user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region. components of results of operationsrevenuewe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the facebook website.advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties, including our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by our users, the number of actions taken by our users, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action.payments and other fees. we enable payments from our users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the facebook website. our users can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when users make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, cost of platform device inventory sold and traffic acquisition costs (tac). tac consists of payments made to third-party entities that have integrated our advertising offerings into their websites or mobile applications.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, marketer-, and developer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, and legal and accounting services. general and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we have acquired.28results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data:

periods in 2013. the increases were primarily due to increases in advertising revenue.advertising revenue increased $1.16 billion, or 64%, and $3.26 billion, or 70%, in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. the primary factor driving advertising revenue growth in this period was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, we estimate that advertising revenue from news feed ads on mobile devices represented approximately 66% and 62%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 49% and 41% in the same periods in 2013.  factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in these periods included: (i) an increase in the number of news feed ads displayed, which are more prominent, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements; (ii) other product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads; (iii) an increase in the number 30of marketers actively advertising on facebook, which we believe increased demand for our ads; and (iv) 19% growth in average daus and 14% growth in maus from september 30, 2013 to september 30, 2014. during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, as compared to the same periods in 2013, the average price per ad increased by 274% and 150%, respectively, and the number of ads delivered decreased by 56% and 32%, respectively. the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-news feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed. the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where users are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.payments and other fees revenue in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014 increased $28 million, or 13%, and $72 million, or 11%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. payments and other fees revenue is currently based predominantly on payments revenue from games played on personal computers. we expect facebook usage on personal computers to continue to decline in the future, which we expect to result in a decline of our payments revenue.cost of revenue three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2014 2013 % change 2014 2013 % change (in millions, except for percentages)cost of

8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. the increases in both periods were primarily due to operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and increased amortization of our intangible assets. these increases were partially offset by items related to data center lease abandonment: we reversed $5 million and $34 million of lease abandonment expense in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively, due to our decision to re-occupy and utilize a previously exited data center, compared to a recognition of $43 million and $108

primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 49% growth in employee headcount from september 30, 2013 to september 30, 2014 in engineering and other technical functions. share-based compensation expenses increased $79 million and $211 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively. additionally, we also recognized a $23 million change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability in research and development expense due to the change in the fair value of our common stock. 31marketing and sales three months ended

september 30, 2014 to support global sales, business development, and customer service. our user-, marketer-, and developer-facing marketing expenses also increased $28 million and $61 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. additionally, share-based compensation expenses also increased $19 million and $55 million in the

expense in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014 also increased $17 million and $39 million, respectively, primarily due to higher consulting fees. additionally, share-based compensation

and $68 million in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances recognized in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively. the decreases in other income/(expense), net were partially offset by decreases in interest expense due to the repayment of our long-term debt in august 2013 and lower capital lease payments.32provision for income taxes  three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2014 2013 % change 2014 2013 % change (in millions, except for percentages)provision for

million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013 primarily due to increases in income before provision for income taxes in both periods.  our effective tax rate decreased in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to a change in our geographic mix of pre-tax income. our effective tax rate increased for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to a non-recurring tax benefit related to the reinstatement of the federal credit for research and development activities applicable to the year ended december 31, 2012 that was recorded in the first quarter of 2013.our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the effect of non-deductible share-based compensation and the impact of acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions. our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing, size and integration of any acquisitions we make.liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $14.25 billion as of september 30, 2014, an increase of $2.80 billion from december 31, 2013, primarily due to $3.87 billion of cash generated from operations and $1.37 billion in excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, offset by $1.31 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $754 million for acquisitions of businesses, and $199 million for principal payments on capital lease transactions.in october 2014, we completed our acquisition of whatsapp inc. (whatsapp), a privately-held cross-platform mobile messaging company, for 178 million of our class a common stock and $4.59 billion in cash. the tax withholdings related to the whatsapp vested merger consideration were funded by net share settlement. after closing, we will also grant 46 million rsus to whatsapp employees.in january 2014, we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of rsus in order to cover any required withholding taxes ("sell-to-cover"), rather than our previous approach of net share settlement. this sell-to-cover approach reduces our cash outflows compared to the net share settlement approach. in august 2013, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 revolving credit facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15, 2018. as of september 30, 2014, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. as of september 30, 2014, $1.01 billion of the $14.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary. these subsidiaries have historically incurred losses; as such, repatriating the funds will likely incur no residual tax liability. we have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary, however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant. we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.33cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2014 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $941 million and total depreciation and amortization of $810 million. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 was mainly due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above, partially offset by a $413 million decrease in income tax refunds.cash provided by (used in) investing activitiescash provided by investing activities was $703 million during the first nine months of 2014 primarily resulted from $2.89 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $1.31 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers and office buildings, and $754 million for acquisition of businesses. cash used in investing activities was $90 million during the first nine months of 2013 primarily resulted from $879 million for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network and storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers and buildings, $237 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents, partially offset by $1.02 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities.in october 2014, upon closing of our acquisition of whatsapp, we used $4.59 billion of our cash and cash equivalent balance for the cash portion of the purchase consideration. we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2014 of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. cash provided by (used in) financing activitiescash provided by financing activities was $1.17 billion for the first nine months of 2014, which primarily resulted from $1.37 billion of excess tax benefit from stock award activities, partially offset by $199 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions.cash used in financing activities was $2.19 billion for the first nine months of 2013, which primarily resulted from $1.5 billion for repayment of debt and $706 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement of equity awards. off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of september 30, 2014.contractual obligationsin april 2014, we entered into a non-cancelable contractual commitment to spend a minimum of $140 million on network services over a period of 10 years.there were no other material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013.contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 9 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. under this guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) when it becomes effective and permits 34the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. early adoption is not permitted. the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. we have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013. item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a. "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.overviewour mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. we build products that support our mission by creating utility for people, marketers, and developers:people. we enable people to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.marketers. we enable marketers to engage with more than 1.3 billion monthly active users (maus) on facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. developers. we enable developers to use facebook's developer services to build, grow and monetize their mobile and web applications more rapidly and successfully.we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers. during the three and nine months ended september 30, 2014, we recorded revenue of $3.20 billion and $8.62 billion, respectively, income from operations of $1.40 billion and $3.86 billion, respectively, and net income of $806 million and $2.24 billion, respectively. 22trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), mobile daus, maus, mobile maus and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram unless otherwise specifically stated. trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with facebook, on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey, asia includes all users in australia and new zealand, and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 23worldwide daus increased 19% to 864 million on average during september 2014 from 728 million during september 2013. we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india, brazil, and the united states. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in september 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia.•mobile daus. we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger app on a given day. worldwide mobile daus increased 39% to 703 million on average during september 2014 from 507 million during september 2013. in all regions, an increasing number of our daus are accessing facebook through mobile devices, with users in brazil, india, and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during september 2014 as compared to the same period during 2013. on average during the month ended september 30, 2014, there were 536 million daus who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website, increasing 54% from 347 million mobile-only daus during the same period in 2013. the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.24•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.    as of september 30, 2014, we had 1.35 billion maus, an increase of 14% from september 30, 2013. users in india and brazil represented key sources of growth in the third quarter of 2014 relative to the same period in 2013. overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in september 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia.25•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger app during the period of measurement. worldwide mobile maus increased 29% to 1.12 billion as of september 30, 2014 from 874 million as of september 30, 2013. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus are accessing facebook through mobile devices, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth over the third quarter of 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. there were 456 million mobile maus who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website during the month ended september 30, 2014, increasing 80% from 254 million during the same period in 2013. the remaining 668 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during september 2014. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.26trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users. for example, arpu for an average user in the third quarter of 2014 in united states & canada was more than six times higher than for an average user in asia.  note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 27during the third quarter of 2014, worldwide arpu was $2.40, an increase of 40% from the third quarter of 2013. over this period, arpu increased by approximately 52% in united states & canada, 46% in europe and asia, and 27% in rest of world. user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region. components of results of operationsrevenuewe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the facebook website.advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties, including our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by our users, the number of actions taken by our users, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action.payments and other fees. we enable payments from our users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the facebook website. our users can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when users make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, cost of platform device inventory sold and traffic acquisition costs (tac). tac consists of payments made to third-party entities that have integrated our advertising offerings into their websites or mobile applications.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, marketer-, and developer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, and legal and accounting services. general and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we have acquired.28results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data:

periods in 2013. the increases were primarily due to increases in advertising revenue.advertising revenue increased $1.16 billion, or 64%, and $3.26 billion, or 70%, in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. the primary factor driving advertising revenue growth in this period was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, we estimate that advertising revenue from news feed ads on mobile devices represented approximately 66% and 62%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 49% and 41% in the same periods in 2013.  factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in these periods included: (i) an increase in the number of news feed ads displayed, which are more prominent, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements; (ii) other product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads; (iii) an increase in the number 30of marketers actively advertising on facebook, which we believe increased demand for our ads; and (iv) 19% growth in average daus and 14% growth in maus from september 30, 2013 to september 30, 2014. during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, as compared to the same periods in 2013, the average price per ad increased by 274% and 150%, respectively, and the number of ads delivered decreased by 56% and 32%, respectively. the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-news feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed. the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where users are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.payments and other fees revenue in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014 increased $28 million, or 13%, and $72 million, or 11%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. payments and other fees revenue is currently based predominantly on payments revenue from games played on personal computers. we expect facebook usage on personal computers to continue to decline in the future, which we expect to result in a decline of our payments revenue.cost of revenue three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2014 2013 % change 2014 2013 % change (in millions, except for percentages)cost of

amortization of our intangible assets. these increases were partially offset by items related to data center lease abandonment: we reversed $5 million and $34 million of lease abandonment expense in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively, due to our decision to re-occupy and utilize a previously exited data center, compared to a recognition of $43 million and $108

primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 49% growth in employee headcount from september 30, 2013 to september 30, 2014 in engineering and other technical functions. share-based compensation expenses increased $79 million and $211 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively. additionally, we also recognized a $23 million change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability in research and development expense due to the change in the fair value of our common stock. 31marketing and sales three months ended

expense in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014 also increased $17 million and $39 million, respectively, primarily due to higher consulting fees. additionally, share-based compensation

and $68 million in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances recognized in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2014, respectively. the decreases in other income/(expense), net were partially offset by decreases in interest expense due to the repayment of our long-term debt in august 2013 and lower capital lease payments.32provision for income taxes  three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2014 2013 % change 2014 2013 % change (in millions, except for percentages)provision for

million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013 primarily due to increases in income before provision for income taxes in both periods.  our effective tax rate decreased in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to a change in our geographic mix of pre-tax income. our effective tax rate increased for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to a non-recurring tax benefit related to the reinstatement of the federal credit for research and development activities applicable to the year ended december 31, 2012 that was recorded in the first quarter of 2013.our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the effect of non-deductible share-based compensation and the impact of acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions. our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing, size and integration of any acquisitions we make.liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $14.25 billion as of september 30, 2014, an increase of $2.80 billion from december 31, 2013, primarily due to $3.87 billion of cash generated from operations and $1.37 billion in excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, offset by $1.31 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $754 million for acquisitions of businesses, and $199 million for principal payments on capital lease transactions.in october 2014, we completed our acquisition of whatsapp inc. (whatsapp), a privately-held cross-platform mobile messaging company, for 178 million of our class a common stock and $4.59 billion in cash. the tax withholdings related to the whatsapp vested merger consideration were funded by net share settlement. after closing, we will also grant 46 million rsus to whatsapp employees.in january 2014, we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of rsus in order to cover any required withholding taxes ("sell-to-cover"), rather than our previous approach of net share settlement. this sell-to-cover approach reduces our cash outflows compared to the net share settlement approach. in august 2013, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 revolving credit facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15, 2018. as of september 30, 2014, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. as of september 30, 2014, $1.01 billion of the $14.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary. these subsidiaries have historically incurred losses; as such, repatriating the funds will likely incur no residual tax liability. we have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary, however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant. we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.33cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2014 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $941 million and total depreciation and amortization of $810 million. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 was mainly due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above, partially offset by a $413 million decrease in income tax refunds.cash provided by (used in) investing activitiescash provided by investing activities was $703 million during the first nine months of 2014 primarily resulted from $2.89 billion

data centers and office buildings, and $754 million for acquisition of businesses. cash used in investing activities was $90 million during the first nine months of 2013 primarily resulted from $879 million for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network and storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers and buildings, $237 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents, partially offset by $1.02 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities.in october 2014, upon closing of our acquisition of whatsapp, we used $4.59 billion of our cash and cash equivalent balance for the cash portion of the purchase consideration. we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2014 of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. cash provided by (used in) financing activitiescash provided by financing activities was $1.17 billion for the first nine months of 2014, which primarily resulted from $1.37 billion of excess tax

months of 2013, which primarily resulted from $1.5 billion for repayment of debt and $706 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement of equity awards. off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of september 30, 2014.contractual obligationsin april 2014, we entered into a non-cancelable contractual commitment to spend a minimum of $140 million on network services over a period of 10 years.there were no other material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013.contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 9 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. under this guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) when it becomes effective and permits 34the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. early adoption is not permitted. the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. we have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2013.
