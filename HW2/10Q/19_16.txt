second quarter of fiscal 2013, we reported net earnings of $1.8 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.24 compared to net earnings of $1.5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.01 for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.  for the first six months of fiscal 2013, we reported net earnings of $3.0 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.07 compared to net earnings of $2.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.68 for the first six months of fiscal 2012.net sales increased 9.5% to $22.5 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 from $20.6 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, net sales increased 8.5% to $41.6 billion from $38.4 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2012. due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, the second quarter of 2013 was negatively impacted by a seasonal timing change that resulted in one less week of spring sales in the quarter when compared to the same period in fiscal 2012. this shift reduced net sales by approximately $249 million, or approximately 120 basis points. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, this seasonal timing change added approximately $325 million, or approximately 80 basis points, of growth to net sales. our comparable store sales increased 10.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, driven by a 5.7% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 4.8% increase in our comparable store average ticket. in the first six months of fiscal 2013, we continued to focus on the following four key initiatives:customer service – our focus on customer service is anchored on the principles of creating an emotional connection with customers, putting customers first and simplifying the business. in the first six months of fiscal 2013, we introduced project simple into store operations, dramatically reducing the administrative tasking within the stores. this allowed us to respond to volume and transaction growth, while maintaining customer satisfaction levels. we expect to achieve our goal of having 60% of our store labor hours dedicated to customer-facing activity by the end of fiscal 2013.product authority – our focus on product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is aimed at delivering innovation, assortment and value. as part of this effort, we introduced innovative new products and great values for both our professional and do-it-yourself customers in a variety of departments.disciplined capital allocation, productivity and efficiency – our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement, incremental supply chain benefits, disciplined capital allocation and expense 11table of contentscontrol and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. in the first six months of fiscal 2013, we continued to make improvements to our forecasting and replenishment systems, helping our business to react to and recover from sales spikes while keeping inventory under control. our inventory turnover ratio was 4.9 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 4.7 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2012. during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we settled a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement that was entered into in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. we received a total of approximately 20.2 million shares under the $1.5 billion asr agreement in the first six months of fiscal 2013, including approximately 2.1 million shares received upon settlement of the agreement in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. also during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into a $1.7 billion asr agreement. we received an initial delivery of approximately 19.6 million shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 under the $1.7 billion asr agreement and approximately 2.4 million additional shares upon settlement of the agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, for a total of approximately 22.0 million shares. we repurchased approximately 14.9 million additional shares of our common stock in the open market during the first six months of fiscal 2013. interconnected retail – our focus on interconnected retail is based on building a competitive platform across all commerce channels. as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2013, approximately one-third of our online orders were completed in a store, either through buy online, pick-up in store ("bopis") or buy online, ship to store ("boss"). when these customers come into our stores to pick up their online orders, approximately one-fifth of them purchase additional items. we also continued the roll out of myinstall, an online functionality that will provide installation services customers with specific installation information, dynamic tracking to keep them informed of the status of the installation, e-mail notifications for appointments and a point of contact to process order changes.we opened one new store in puerto rico during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, for a total store count of 2,258 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2013, a total of 281 of our stores, or 12.4%, were located in canada and mexico.we generated $4.7 billion of cash flow from operations in the first six months of fiscal 2013. this cash flow, along with $2.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, was used in part to fund $4.3 billion of share repurchases, pay $1.1 billion of dividends and fund $599 million in capital expenditures.our return on invested capital (computed on net operating profit after tax for the trailing twelve months and the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity) was 19.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 16.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012.12table of contentswe believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the

increased 9.5% to $22.5 billion from $20.6 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, net sales increased 8.5% to $41.6 billion from $38.4 billion for the comparable period of fiscal 2012. the increase in net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales. total comparable store sales increased 10.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to an increase of 2.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, total comparable store sales increased 7.7% compared to an increase of 3.8% for the same period of fiscal 2012. due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was negatively impacted by a seasonal timing change that reduced net sales by approximately $249 million, or approximately 120 basis points. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, this seasonal timing change added approximately $325 million, or approximately 80 basis points, of growth to net sales.the positive comparable store sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, strong sales in our appliance business, continued strength in the core categories of our store, and an improved u.s. and canadian housing market. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013, and comparable store average ticket increased 4.8% and 4.5% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013, respectively. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 5.7% and 3.0% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013, respectively. our kitchen, indoor garden, lumber, outdoor garden, lighting, tools, electrical and flooring product categories had double-digit positive comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2013.gross profit increased 9.9% to $7.7 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 from $7.0 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. gross profit increased 9.0% to $14.4 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2013 from $13.2 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2012. gross profit as a percent of net sales increased 12 basis points to 34.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 34.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, gross profit as a percent of net sales was 34.6% compared to 34.4% for the comparable period of fiscal 2012, an increase of 16 basis points. the increase in gross profit margin for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 was driven primarily by our recently acquired businesses, which are gross margin accretive, expense leverage within our supply chain and improved shrink performance, partially offset by a change in mix of products sold. selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 5.6% to $4.3 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 from $4.1 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and increased 4.0% to $8.5 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2013 from $8.2 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2012. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 19.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 19.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 20.4% compared to 21.2% for the same period last year. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls.depreciation and amortization increased 4.6% to $409 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 from $391 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, depreciation and amortization increased 4.8% to $811 million from $774 million for the same period of fiscal 2012. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 1.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and was 1.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2013 compared to 2.0% for the first six months of fiscal 2012. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 reflects expense leverage in the positive comparable store sales environment, offset by higher depreciation related to capital expenditures that in recent years have been more heavily weighted toward technology assets, which have shorter depreciable lives.operating income increased 17.5% to $3.0 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 from $2.6 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. operating income increased 19.4% to $5.1 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2013 from $4.3 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2012.for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we recognized $172 million of interest and other, net, compared to $151 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. we recognized $333 million of interest and other, net, for the first six months of fiscal 2013 compared to $235 million for the same period last year, reflecting increased interest expense associated with the april 2013 issuance. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 0.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. for the first six months of fiscal 2013, interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.8% compared to 0.6% for the same period last year. interest and other, net, for the first six months of 2012 included a $67 million pretax benefit related to the termination of our guarantee of a senior secured loan of hd supply, inc.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2013 compared to 36.6% for the first six months of fiscal 2012.14table of contentsdiluted earnings per share were $1.24 and $2.07 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013, respectively, compared to $1.01 and $1.68 for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2012, respectively. diluted earnings per share for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2013 reflect $0.05 and $0.09, respectively, of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended august 4, 2013.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. during the first six months of fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion for the same period in fiscal 2012. this increase is primarily due to a $454 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls. the amount of cash flow generated in the first six months of fiscal 2013 from working capital and other, including merchandise inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses, was consistent with the same period last year.net cash used in investing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2013 was $596 million compared to $581 million for the same period in fiscal 2012. this change was primarily due to a $48 million increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease of $32 million in payments for businesses acquired in the first six months of fiscal 2013 compared to the same period last year.net cash used in financing activities for the first six months of fiscal 2013 was $3.2 billion compared to $2.9 billion for the same period of fiscal 2012. this change was primarily the result of $1.7 billion more in repurchases of common stock, $403 million less in proceeds from the sale of common stock and $263 million more in cash dividends paid to stockholders in the first six months of fiscal 2013 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2012, partially offset by $2.0 billion in net proceeds from long-term borrowings in the first six months of fiscal 2013.in april 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.70% senior notes due april 1, 2023 at a discount of $2 million and $1.0 billion of 4.20% senior notes due april 1, 2043 at a discount of $4 million (together, the "april 2013 issuance"). interest on these notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2013. the net proceeds of the april 2013 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.5 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 18.1 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. the transaction was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, at which time we received approximately 2.1 million additional shares. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.5 billion asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement.in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.7 billion of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $1.7 billion to the financial institution and received an initial delivery of approximately 19.6 million shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. the transaction was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, at which time we received approximately 2.4 million additional shares. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $1.7 billion asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement.in the first six months of fiscal 2013, we also repurchased approximately 14.9 million additional shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion in the open market. as of the end of the first six months of fiscal 2013, $12.7 billion remained under the $17.0 billion share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in february 2013. we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. as of august 4, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility. the credit facility expires in july 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. as of august 4, 2013, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.as of august 4, 2013, we had $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.15table of contents
