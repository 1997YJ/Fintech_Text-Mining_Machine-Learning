our
md&a is provided in addition to the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements and footnotes to assist readers in understanding pfizer’s
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the md&a is
organized as follows:






·  


overview of our performance
      and operating environment. this section, beginning on page 26,
      provides information about the following: our business; our performance
      during the second quarter and first six months of 2009; our operating
      environment; our strategic initiatives; and our cost-reduction
      initiatives.











·  


revenues. this section,
      beginning on page 31, provides an analysis of our products and revenues
      for the three-and six-month periods ended june 28, 2009 and june 29, 2008,
      as well as an overview of important product
  developments.











·  


costs and expenses.
      this section, beginning on page 40, provides a discussion about our costs
      and expenses.











·  


provision for taxes on
      income. this section, beginning on page 42, provides a discussion
      of items impacting our tax provision for the periods
      presented.











·  


adjusted income. this
      section, beginning on page 43, provides a discussion of an alternative
      view of performance used by
management.











·  


financial condition, liquidity
      and capital resources. this section, beginning on page 47, provides
      an analysis of our balance sheets as of june 28, 2009 and december 31,
      2008 and cash flows for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, as well as
      a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments that existed as of
      june 28, 2009, and december 31, 2008. included in the discussion of
      outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity
      available to help fund pfizer’s future

      on page 51, provides a discussion of our expectations for full-year
      2009.











·  


forward-looking information
      and factors that may affect future results. this section, beginning
      on page 52, provides a description of the risks and uncertainties that
      could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in
      forward-looking
      statements set forth in this md&a relating to our financial results,
      operations and business plans and prospects. such forward-looking
      statements are based on management’s current expectations about future
      events, which are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in
      circumstances. also included in this section is a discussion of legal
      proceedings and
contingencies.

overview of our performance
and operating environment

our
business

we are a
global, research-based company applying innovative science to improve world
health. our efforts in support of that purpose include the discovery,
development, manufacture and marketing of safe and effective medicines; the
exploration of ideas that advance the frontiers of science and medicine; and the
support of programs dedicated to illness prevention, health and wellness, and
increased access to quality healthcare. our value proposition is to demonstrate
that our medicines can effectively prevent and treat disease, including the
associated symptoms and suffering, and can form the basis for an overall
improvement in healthcare systems and their related costs. our revenues are
derived from the sale of our products, as well as through alliance agreements,
under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies.

on
january 26, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger
agreement under which we will acquire wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction
valued on that date at $50.19 per share, or a total of $68 billion. while we
have taken actions and incurred costs associated with the pending transaction
that are reflected in our financial statements, the acquisition of wyeth will
not be reflected in our financial statements until consummation. (see also the
“our strategic initiatives – strategy and recent transactions” and “costs and
expenses – acquisition-related costs” sections of this md&a.)

our 2009
performance

revenues decreased 9% for
both the second quarter and for the first six months of 2009, compared to the
same periods in 2008. the significant human pharmaceutical product, alliance
revenue and animal health impacts on revenues for the second quarter and first
six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, are as

(a)
lipitor
      was unfavorably impacted primarily by foreign exchange, as well as
      competitive pressures and other factors.



(b)


zyrtec/zyrtec
      d lost u.s. exclusivity in late january 2008, at which time we ceased
      selling this product. camptosar lost u.s. exclusivity in february 2008.
      norvasc lost exclusivity in japan in july
2008.











(c)


chantix/champix
      has been negatively impacted by the changes to its label in 2008.
      additional label changes were made in july 2009 (see “revenues –
      pharmaceutical – selected product descriptions” section of this
      md&a).






foreign
exchange unfavorably impacted revenues by approximately $1.1 billion, or 9%, in
the second quarter of 2009 and approximately $1.7 billion, or 7%, during the
first six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008.

in the
u.s., revenues decreased 5% in the second quarter of 2009 and 7% in the first
six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, while international
revenues decreased 12% in the second quarter of 2009 and 10% in the first six
months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008.

the
impact of rebates in the second quarter of 2009 decreased revenues by
approximately $920 million, compared to approximately $759 million in the
prior-year second quarter. the impact of rebates in the first six months of 2009
decreased revenues by approximately $1.9 billion, compared to approximately $1.7
billion for the first six months of 2008. the increase in rebates in each of the
periods was due primarily to the impact of our contracting strategies with both
government and non-government entities in the u.s.







26









(see
further discussion in the “revenues – pharmaceutical business revenues” section
of this md&a.)

income from continuing operations
for the second quarter of 2009 was $2.3 billion, compared to $2.8 billion
in the second quarter of 2008, and $5.0 billion in the first six months of 2009,
compared to $5.6 billion in the first six months of 2008.

the
decreases were primarily due to:





·  


the
      unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange;









·  


the
      increase in the effective tax rate attributable mainly to increased tax
      costs associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the
      pending acquisition of wyeth;









·  


the
      decrease in other (income)/deductions –
      net attributable mainly to lower interest income and to higher
      interest expense; and









·  


costs
      incurred in connection with the pending wyeth
  acquisition;





partially
offset by:





·  


savings
      related to our cost-reduction
initiatives;









·  


lower
      costs associated with implementing our-cost reduction initiatives;
      and









·  


lower
      acquisition-related in-process research and development charges of $20
      million in the second quarter and first six months of 2009 compared to
      $156 million in the second quarter of 2008 and $554 million in the first
      six months of 2008.





we have
made significant progress with our cost-reduction initiatives, launched in early
2005, which are broad-based, company-wide efforts to improve performance and
efficiency (see further discussion in the “our cost-reduction initiatives”
section of this md&a).

during
the first six months of 2009 and 2008, we expensed acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (ipr&d) of $20 million related to a
2008 acquisition (see further discussion in the “our strategic initiatives –
strategy and recent transactions: acquisitions, licensing and collaborations”
section of this md&a). as a result of adopting financial accounting
standards board (fasb) statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no.
141r, business
combinations, as amended, beginning january 1, 2009, ipr&d related to
future acquisitions will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as
indefinite-lived intangible assets. no acquisitions were consummated in the
first half of 2009.

our operating
environment

general
economic conditions
while the
global recession has affected our business, the impact so far has been
consistent with the expectations reflected in our financial guidance for 2009
(see the “outlook” section of this md&a). the impact on our human
pharmaceutical business has been largely in the u.s. market, affecting products
such as lipitor, lyrica, celebrex, xalatan and geodon. health insurers and
benefit plans continue to impose formulary restrictions in favor of generics. we
believe that patients, experiencing the effects of the weak economy and facing
increases in co-pays, are sometimes switching to generics, delaying treatments
or skipping doses to reduce their costs. and the recession has increased the
number of patients in the medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals
are subject to substantial rebates and, in many states, to formulary
restrictions limiting access to brand-name drugs. our animal health business
also has been impacted by the recession, which has adversely affected global
spending on veterinary care.

despite
the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position.
we have a strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity that provides us with
financial flexibility. our long-term debt is rated high quality and investment
grade by both standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service. as market
conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have and
will continue to take a conservative approach to our investments. both
short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly
liquid, investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. as a result, we
continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the
foreseeable future (see further discussion in the “financial condition,
liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a).

industry-specific
challenges
in
addition to general economic conditions, we and other pharmaceutical companies
continue to face significant industry-specific challenges in a profoundly
changing business environment, as explained more fully in pfizer’s annual report
on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2008. industry-wide factors,
including pharmaceutical product pricing and access, intellectual property
rights, product competition, the regulatory environment, pipeline productivity
and the changing business environment, can significantly impact our businesses.
in order to meet these challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the
marketplace, we are taking steps to change the way we operate our pharmaceutical
and other businesses. effective january 1, 2009, we changed our operating model
within the pharmaceutical segment, which is now comprised of five
customer-focused units—primary care, specialty care, oncology, established
products and emerging markets—with clear, single points of accountability to
enable the segment to more effectively anticipate and respond to the diverse
needs of physicians, customers and patients. as in the past, the pharmaceutical
segment continues to be managed inclusive of our research and manufacturing
organizations and supported by administrative functions.

generic
competition and patent expirations significantly impact our business. we lost
exclusivity for camptosar in the u.s. in february 2008 and for norvasc in the
u.s. in march 2007 and in japan in july 2008 and, as expected, significant
revenue declines followed. zyrtec/zyrtec d lost its u.s. exclusivity in late
january 2008, at which time we ceased selling this product. lipitor began to
face competition in the u.s. in 2006 from generic pravastatin (pravachol) and
generic simvastatin (zocor), in addition to other competitive pressures. the
volume of patients who start on or switch to generic simvastatin continues to
negatively impact lipitor prescribing trends, particularly in the managed-care
environment.

we will
continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasing incidents
of infringement whenever appropriate. for more detailed information about our
significant products, see discussion in the “revenues – pharmaceutical –
selected product descriptions” section of this md&a. also, see part ii –
other information; item
1. legal proceedings,
of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect
to patent litigation.

u.s.
policy issues
healthcare
reform in the u.s., if enacted, could have a significant impact on our business.
although we cannot predict the outcome of pending and possible future u.s.
healthcare reform initiatives, we remain committed and actively engaged in
discussions to reform healthcare in a way that expands coverage for those
currently uninsured, does not erode coverage for those currently insured,
improves quality, rewards innovation and provides value for patients. during the
second quarter of 2009, the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america
(phrma), of which we are a member, announced an $80 billion commitment over the
next decade to support healthcare reform in the u.s. among other things, that
commitment includes reducing the cost of medicines for seniors and disabled
americans who are affected by the coverage gap in the medicare prescription drug
program. the phrma commitment is intended to be part of any federal healthcare
reform legislation in the u.s.

comprehensive
tax reform in the u.s., if enacted, also could have a significant impact on our
business. although we cannot predict the outcome of pending and possible future
u.s. tax reform proposals, we remain engaged in discussions with policymakers.
specifically, if legislation were enacted that ends the deferral of u.s.
taxation of income earned overseas by u.s. companies, it may adversely impact
our ability to compete against other companies in our industry, many of which
are not based in the u.s.

these and
other factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with
information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may
affect future results” section of this md&a.

our strategic initiatives –
strategy and recent transactions

acquisitions,
licensing and collaborations

we are
committed to capitalizing on new growth opportunities by advancing our
new-product pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well
as through opportunistic licensing, co-promotion agreements and acquisitions.
our business-development strategy targets a number of growth opportunities,
including biologics, vaccines, oncology, diabetes, alzheimer’s disease,
inflammation/immunology, pain, psychoses (schizophrenia) and other products and
services that seek to provide valuable healthcare solutions. some of our more
significant business-development transactions during the first six months of
2009 and 2008 are described below:






·  


in
      the first quarter of 2009, we entered into a five-year agreement with
      bausch & lomb to co-promote prescription pharmaceuticals in the u.s.
      for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. the agreement covers
      prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, including our xalatan product and
      bausch & lomb’s alrex®, lotemax® and zylet® products, as well as
      bausch & lomb’s investigational anti-infective eye drop, besifloxacin
      ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%, which is currently under review by the u.s.
      food and drug administration
(fda).











·  


in
      the second quarter of 2008, we acquired encysive pharmaceuticals inc.
      (encysive), a biopharmaceutical company whose main asset is thelin, which
      is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. the cost of
      acquiring encysive, through a tender offer and subsequent merger, was
      approximately $200 million, including transaction costs. upon our
      acquisition of encysive, encysive's change of control repurchase
      obligations under its outstanding $130 million 2.5% convertible notes were
      triggered and, as a result, encysive repurchased the convertible notes in
      consideration for their par value plus accrued interest in june 2008. in
      addition, in the second quarter of 2008, we acquired serenex, inc.
      (serenex), a privately held biotechnology company, whose main asset is
      snx-5422, an oral heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) for the potential
      treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies and an extensive
      hsp90 inhibitor compound library, which has potential uses in treating
      cancer, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. in connection with
      these acquisitions, through second-quarter 2008, we recorded $156 million
      in acquisition-related
      in-process research and development charges and approximately $450
      million in intangible assets.












28














·  


in
      the first quarter of 2008, we acquired covx, a privately held
      biotherapeutics company specializing in preclinical oncology and metabolic
      research and the developer of a biotherapeutics technology platform. also
      in the first quarter of 2008, we acquired all the outstanding shares of
      coley pharmaceutical group, inc. (coley), a biopharmaceutical company
      specializing in vaccines and drug candidates designed to fight cancers,
      allergy and asthma disorders, and autoimmune diseases, for approximately
      $230 million. in connection with these and two smaller acquisitions
      related to animal health, we recorded approximately $398 million in acquisition-related in-process
      research and development charges in the first quarter of 2008. in
      the second quarter of 2009, we resolved a contingency associated with covx
      and recognized $20 million in acquisition-related in-process
      research and development
charges.






the
following transactions were not completed as of the end of the second quarter of
2009, and our consolidated financial statements as of june 28, 2009 do not
assume their completion. however, we have incurred costs related to the pending
acquisition of wyeth that are reflected in our financial
statements.






·  


on
      april 16, 2009, we announced that we entered into an agreement with
      glaxosmithkline plc (gsk) to create a new company focused solely on
      research, development and commercialization of hiv medicines. we and gsk
      will contribute certain product and pipeline assets to the new company.
      the new company will have a broad product portfolio of 11 marketed
      products, including innovative leading therapies such as gsk’s combivir and kivexa products and our selzentry/celsentri
      (maraviroc) product. the company will have a pipeline of six
      innovative and targeted medicines, including four compounds in phase 2
      development. the new company will contract r&d and manufacturing
      services directly from gsk and us and will also enter into a new research
      alliance agreement with gsk and us. under this new alliance, the new
      company will invest in our and gsk’s programs for discovery research and
      development into hiv medicines. the new company will have exclusive rights
      of first negotiation in relation to any new hiv-related medicines
      developed by either gsk or us. we will initially hold a 15% equity
      interest in the new company, and gsk will hold an 85% equity interest. the
      equity interests will be adjusted in the event that specified sales and
      regulatory milestones are achieved. our equity interest in the new company
      could vary from 9% to 30.5%, and gsk’s equity interest in the new company
      could vary from 69.5% to 91%, depending upon the milestones achieved with
      respect to the original pipeline assets contributed by us and by gsk to
      the new company. each company may also be entitled to preferential
      dividend payments to the extent that specific sales thresholds are met in
      respect of the marketed products and pipeline assets originally
      contributed. we will account for our share of the new company as an equity
      method investment. the closing of the transaction and commencement of the
      new company’s business are conditional upon certain matters, including
      receiving certain regulatory and tax clearances, and no material adverse
      change occurring in respect of either gsk’s or our hiv business prior to
      closing. we and gsk will conduct consultations with works councils in
      accordance with applicable employment legislation. the transaction is
      expected to close in the fourth quarter of
2009.











·  


on
      january 26, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger
      agreement under which we will acquire wyeth in a cash-and-stock
      transaction valued on that date at $50.19 per share, or a total of $68
      billion. the boards of directors of both pfizer and wyeth have approved
      the transaction. under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding
      share of wyeth common stock will be converted into the right to receive
      $33 in cash and 0.985 of a share of pfizer common stock, subject to
      adjustment as set forth in the merger agreement. each outstanding wyeth
      stock option, and each outstanding share of wyeth restricted stock,
      deferred stock unit award and restricted stock unit award, will be
      exchanged for cash in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
      in addition, the merger agreement provides that each share of wyeth $2
      convertible preferred stock will be exchanged for a newly created class of
      pfizer preferred stock having substantially the same rights as the wyeth
      $2 convertible preferred stock. however, in july 2009, pursuant to a
      request from us made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
      merger agreement, all of wyeth’s outstanding $2 convertible preferred
      stock that was not previously converted to wyeth common stock at the
      option of the holders of such stock was redeemed by wyeth. as a result, we
      will not issue any preferred stock in connection with the
      merger.






we expect
the wyeth transaction will close at the end of the third quarter or during the
fourth quarter of 2009. we issued $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on
march 24, 2009 and approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on june
3, 2009, of which virtually all of the proceeds will be used to partially
finance our pending acquisition of wyeth (see notes to condensed consolidated
financial statements note
8d. financial
instruments: long-term debt). as a result of these issuances, we
terminated the bridge term loan credit agreement in june 2009 that we and
certain financial institutions had entered into in march 2009 in connection with
the transaction. in july 2009, wyeth’s shareholders approved the acquisition.
also in july 2009, the european commission approved the transaction, a decision
that included our commitment to divest certain animal-health assets in the
european union. the merger remains subject to other governmental and regulatory
approvals and other usual and customary closing conditions. we believe that the
combination of pfizer and wyeth will create the world’s premier
biopharmaceutical company and will meaningfully deliver on pfizer’s strategic
priorities in a single transaction. the combined entity will be one of the most
diversified in the industry and will enable us to offer patients a uniquely
broad and diversified portfolio of biopharmaceutical innovation through
patient-centric units.







29









we expect
to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $4 billion by the end of 2012
related solely to this transaction. we expect we will incur acquisition-related
restructuring charges and integration costs associated with the expected cost
savings, which we estimate could be in the range of approximately $6 billion to
$8 billion, and which will be expensed as incurred.

unless we
have wyeth’s specific consent, we cannot make acquisitions prior to the
completion of the merger, except for acquisitions for which cash consideration
does not exceed $750 million in the aggregate.

our cost-reduction
initiatives

during
2008, we completed the cost-reduction initiatives that were launched in early
2005, broadened in october 2006 and expanded in january 2007. these initiatives
were designed to increase efficiency and streamline decision-making across the
company and change the way we run our businesses to meet the challenges of a
changing business environment, as well as take advantage of the diverse
opportunities in the marketplace.

we have
generated net cost reductions through site rationalization in r&d and
manufacturing, streamlining organizational structures, sales force and staff
function reductions, and increased outsourcing and procurement savings. these
and other actions have allowed us to reduce costs in support services and
facilities.

on
january 26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new cost-reduction
initiative that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs
of approximately $3 billion, based on the actual foreign exchange rates in
effect during 2008, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total
costs. we expect that this program will be completed by the end of 2010, with
full savings to be realized by the end of 2011. we plan to reinvest
approximately $1 billion of these savings in the business, resulting in an
expected $2 billion net decrease compared to our 2008 adjusted total costs. for
an understanding of adjusted income, see the “adjusted income” section of this
md&a.

as part
of this new cost-reduction initiative, we intend to reduce our total worldwide
workforce by approximately 10% from the year-end 2008 level. reductions span
sales, manufacturing, research and development, and administrative
organizations. in the second quarter of 2009, we reduced our workforce by
approximately 3,750 employees and, in the first six months of 2009, we reduced
our workforce by approximately 5,400 employees. these declines were net of new
employees hired in expanding areas of our business. we also intend to reduce our
facilities square footage by approximately 15%. we expect to incur costs related
to this new cost-reduction initiative of approximately $6 billion, pre-tax, of
which $1.5 billion was recorded in 2008. during the second quarter of 2009, we
incurred costs related to this new cost-reduction initiative of $330 million
and, in the first six months of 2009, we incurred costs related to this new
cost-reduction initiative of $661 million. for additional details on amounts
incurred related to our cost-reduction initiatives, see the “costs and expenses
– cost-reduction initiatives” section of this md&a.

projects
in various stages of implementation include:

pfizer
global research and development (pgrd)





·  


creating a more agile and
      productive organization—in january 2009, we announced that we plan
      to reduce our global research staff. we expect these reductions, which are
      part of the planned 10% total workforce reduction discussed above, will be
      completed during 2009.






after a
review of all our therapeutic areas, in 2008, we announced our decision to exit
certain disease areas and give higher priority to the following disease areas:
alzheimer's disease, diabetes, inflammation/immunology, oncology, pain and
psychoses (schizophrenia). we also will continue to work in many other disease
areas, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, genitourinary,
infectious diseases, ophthalmology, smoking cessation, thrombosis and
transplant, among others. with a smaller, more focused research portfolio, we
are able to devote our resources to the most valuable opportunities. these
decisions did not affect our portfolio of marketed products, the development of
compounds then in phase 3 or any launches planned through 2011.







30









we
continue to focus on reduced cycle time and improved compound survival in the
drug discovery and development process. over the next two years, our goal is to
realize a 25% to 33% reduction in cycle time in the period from final approved
protocol to last subject-first visit, as new processes and procedures are
adopted for newly initiated phase 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. in the past couple
of years, a number of steps have been taken to improve compound survival, such
as rigorous analyses of the successful and unsuccessful projects in the entire
portfolio, to ensure that results are captured and applied to ongoing programs
and to portfolio decisions.

pfizer
global manufacturing (pgm)





·  


supply network transformation - we are
      transforming our global manufacturing network into a global strategic
      supply network, consisting of our internal network of plants together with
      strategic external manufacturers, and including purchasing, packaging and
      distribution. as of the end of the second quarter of 2009, we have reduced
      our internal network of plants from 93 in 2003 to 45, which includes the
      acquisition of seven plants and the sites sold in 2006 as part of our
      consumer healthcare business. we plan to reduce our internal network of
      plants around the world to 41. we expect that the cumulative impact will
      be a more focused, streamlined and competitive manufacturing operation,
      with less than 50% of our former internal plants and more than 53% fewer
      manufacturing employees, compared to 2003. as part of the transformation
      to a global strategic supply network, we currently expect to increase
      outsourced manufacturing from approximately 24% of our products, on a cost
      basis, to approximately 30% over the next two
  years.







worldwide
pharmaceutical operations (wpo)






·  


reorganization of our field
      force - as part of pfizer’s overall restructuring into smaller,
      more focused business units, we have changed our global field force
      operations to enable us to adapt to changing market dynamics and respond
      to local customer needs more quickly and with more flexibility. this
      process, which began in 2007, is generating savings from de-layering,
      eliminating duplicative work, and utilizing our sales representatives more
      efficiently through targeted deployment, offset modestly by increased
      investment in certain emerging markets. between 2004 and the end of the
      second quarter of 2009, we reduced our global field force by approximately
      20%, with approximately 18% of the total reductions occurring since the
      beginning of 2007.

pharmaceutical business
revenues


worldwide
pharmaceutical revenues decreased 9% for the second quarter of 2009 and 8% for
the first six months of 2009, primarily due to:






·  


the
      strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily
      the euro, u.k. pound, canadian dollar and australian dollar, which
      unfavorably impacted pharmaceutical revenues by $964 million, or 9%, in
      the second quarter of 2009 and $1.5 billion, or 7%, in the first six
      months of 2009;











·  


an
      operational decrease in worldwide revenues for lipitor of $27 million in
      the second quarter of 2009 and $257 million in the first six months of
      2009, primarily resulting from competitive pressures from generics, among
      other factors;











·  


an
      aggregate decrease in revenues for zyrtec/zyrtec d, camptosar and norvasc
      of $169 million in the second quarter of 2009 and $401 million in the
      first six months of 2009, due to the loss of u.s. exclusivity and
      cessation of selling of zyrtec/zyrtec d in january 2008, the loss of u.s.
      exclusivity of camptosar in february 2008 and the loss of norvasc
      exclusivity in japan in july 2008;
and











·  


a
      decrease in worldwide revenues for chantix/champix of $15 million in the
      second quarter of 2009 and $115 million in the first six months of 2009,
      primarily resulting from changes to the chantix label during 2008, among
      other factors;






partially
offset by:






·  


solid
      operational performance from certain products, including lyrica and
      revatio, and higher alliance
revenue.






geographically,






·  


in
      the u.s., pharmaceutical revenues decreased 4% in the second quarter of
      2009 and 6% in the first six months of 2009, compared to the same periods
      of 2008, primarily due to lower sales of lipitor, celebrex and caduet as a
      result of continued generic pressures, the effect of the loss of
      exclusivity of norvasc, zyrtec/zyrtec d and camptosar and increased
      rebates as a result of the impact of certain contract changes and
      increased pricing pressures. these decreases were partially offset by the
      solid performance from certain products, including revatio, viagra and
      geodon, during the current quarter;
and











·  


in
      our international markets, pharmaceutical revenues decreased 12% in the
      second quarter of 2009 and 10% in the first six months of 2009, compared
      to the same periods of 2008, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of
      foreign exchange on international revenues of $964 million, or 14%, in the
      second quarter of 2009 and $1.5 billion, or 12%, in the first six months
      of 2009, and lower sales of norvasc, champix and camptosar, partially
      offset by operational growth, with higher revenues from certain products,
      including lyrica and sutent.






during
the second quarter of 2009, international pharmaceutical revenues represented
58.4% of total pharmaceutical revenues, compared to 60.4% in the second quarter
of 2008. during the first six months of 2009, international pharmaceutical
revenues represented 55.9% of total pharmaceutical revenues, compared to 56.7%
in the first six months of 2008.

effective
january 3, 2009, august 1, 2008, may 2, 2008 and january 1, 2008, we increased
the published prices for certain u.s. pharmaceutical products. these price
increases had no material effect on wholesaler inventory levels in comparison to
the prior year.

as is
typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a
variety of deductions, that are generally estimated and recorded in the same
period that the revenues are recognized. these deductions primarily represent
rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and
managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. as these
deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, judgment and
knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the
impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our
overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results
generally have been less than 1% of pharmaceutical net sales and can result in
either a net increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate
charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual
product growth trends.

rebates
under medicaid and related state programs reduced revenues by $158 million in
the second quarter of 2009, compared to $65 million in the second quarter of
2008, and by $308 million in the first six months of 2009, compared to $243
million in the first six months of 2008. the increases in rebates under medicaid
and related state programs were due primarily to increased rates for lyrica and
a favorable adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2008 to adjust for
the
estimated impact of the deficit reduction act.

rebates
under medicare reduced revenues by $214 million in the second quarter of 2009,
compared to $201 million in the second quarter of 2008, and by $444 million in
the first six months of 2009, compared to $422 million in the first six months
of 2008, due primarily to increased rebates for celebrex.

performance-based
contract and other rebates reduced revenues by $549 million in the second
quarter of 2009, compared to $493 million in the second quarter of 2008, and by
$1.2 billion in the first six months of 2009, compared to $1.0 billion in the
first six months of 2008. the increases in performance-based contract and other
rebates were due primarily to the impact of certain contract changes which
resulted in increased rates related to lipitor. these contracts are with managed
care customers, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit
managers, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance
terms for products. rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given
period are impacted by the mix of products sold.

chargebacks
(primarily reimbursements to wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third
parties) reduced revenues by $523 million in the second quarter of 2009,
compared to $438 million in the second quarter of 2008, and by $1.0 billion in
the first six months of 2009, compared to $945 million in the first six months
of 2008. the increases in chargebacks were due primarily to increased sales that
are subject to chargebacks.

our
accruals for medicaid and related state programs rebates, medicare rebates,
performance-based contract and other rebates and chargebacks totaled $1.8
billion as of june 28, 2009, an increase from $1.6 billion as of december 31,
2008, due primarily to the impact of certain contract changes and increased
pricing pressures.

product descriptions:






·  


lipitor, for the
      treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood, is the most
      widely used prescription treatment for lowering cholesterol and the
      best-selling pharmaceutical product of any kind in the world. lipitor
      recorded worldwide revenues of $2.7 billion or a decrease of 10% in the
      second quarter of 2009 and $5.4 billion or a decrease of 12% in the first
      six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008. these results in
      part reflect the negative impact of foreign exchange, which decreased
      revenues by $264 million, or 9%, in the second quarter of 2009, and $450
      million, or 7%, in the first six months of 2009, compared to the same
      periods in 2008. in the u.s., revenues were $1.3 billion or a decrease of
      6% in the second quarter of 2009 and $2.8 billion or a decrease of 12% in
      the first six months of 2009, compared with the same periods in 2008.
      internationally, lipitor revenues were $1.4 billion or a decrease of 13%
      in the second quarter of 2009 and $2.6 billion or a decrease of 11% in the
      first six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008. the
      unfavorable impact of foreign exchange more than offset operational growth
      of 4% in international markets in both the second quarter and first six
      months of 2009, compared to the same periods last
  year.






the
decrease in lipitor worldwide revenues in the second quarter and first six
months of 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 was driven by a combination
of factors, including the following:
 







·


primarily,
      the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange; as well
  as











·


the
      impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition
      from multi-source generic simvastatin and branded products in the
      u.s.;











·


increased
      payer pressure in the u.s.; and











·


slower
      growth in the lipid-lowering market, due in part to a slower rate of
      growth in the medicare part d population and, reflecting the global
      recession, heightened overall patient cost-sensitivity in the u.s. and
      adoption of non-prescription treatment
options;









 
      


partially
      offset by:











·


operational
      growth internationally.

norvasc, for treating
      hypertension, lost exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2007. norvasc has also
      experienced patent expirations in most other major markets, including
      japan in july 2008. norvasc worldwide revenues in the second quarter of
      2009 decreased by 17% and in the first six months of 2009 decreased by
      12%, compared to the same periods in
2008.

chantix/champix, the
      first new prescription treatment to aid smoking cessation in nearly a
      decade, has been launched in all major markets. chantix/champix has been
      prescribed to more than ten million patients globally since its launch.
      chantix/ champix worldwide revenues decreased 7% in the second quarter of
      2009 and 24% in first six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in
      2008. year-to-date prescription trends and revenues for chantix have
      declined compared to last year following the changes to the product’s
      label and other factors. we are continuing our educational and promotional
      efforts, which are focused on the chantix benefit-risk proposition, the
      significant health consequences of smoking and the importance of the
      physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit
    smoking.



 
 


 
in
      january 2008, we added a warning to chantix’s label that patients who are
      attempting to quit smoking by taking chantix should be observed by a
      physician for neuropsychiatric symptoms like changes in behavior,
      agitation, depressed mood, suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. a
      causal relationship between chantix and these reported symptoms has not
      been established. there are also confounding factors that limit
      interpretation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in smokers. for example,
      quitting smoking has been associated with symptoms of nicotine withdrawal,
      such as depressed mood and anxiety. in addition, research has shown that
      smokers have a higher rate of depression and suicide-related events than
      non-smokers.


 
 


 
in
      may 2008, we updated the chantix label to provide further guidance about
      the safe use of chantix. the updated label advises that patients should
      stop taking chantix and contact their healthcare provider immediately if
      agitation, depressed mood, or changes in behavior that are not typical for
      them are observed, or if they develop suicidal thoughts or suicidal
      behavior.




 






35









 




 
in
      july 2009, we further updated the chantix label to highlight reports of
      serious neuropsychiatric events in a boxed warning; updated the warning
      about reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms and suicidality; added warnings
      about reports of allergic reactions and serious skin reactions; and
      updated precautionary information about driving or operating machinery to
      include details about reports of accidental injury. the boxed warning
      about reports of serious neuropsychiatric events was also added to the
      labels of prescription smoking cessation aids produced by other
      pharmaceutical companies. these updates will help further enhance
      discussions between physicians and patients about the benefits and risks
      of chantix.


 
 



·  


caduet, a single-pill
      therapy combining norvasc and lipitor, recorded decreases in worldwide
      revenues of 12% in the second quarter of 2009 and 11% in the first six
      months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, primarily due to
      increased generic competition as well as an overall decline in u.s.
      hypertension market volume.











·  


lyrica, indicated for
      the management of post-herpetic neuralgia (phn), diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (dpn), fibromyalgia, and as adjunctive therapy for adult
      patients with partial onset seizures in the u.s., and for neuropathic
      pain, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and general anxiety disorder (gad)
      outside the u.s., recorded increases in worldwide revenues of 2% in the
      second quarter of 2009 and 10% in the first six months of 2009, compared
      to the same periods in 2008. in the u.s., revenue has been adversely
      affected by increased generic
competition.





 






 


in
      july 2008, an fda advisory committee concurred with the fda’s finding of a
      potential increased signal regarding suicidal thoughts and behavior for
      the class of 11 epilepsy drugs reviewed, including lyrica and neurontin.
      in april 2009, we updated the labels for lyrica, neurontin and certain
      older epilepsy medications to include this new warning. we are confident
      in the efficacy and safety profile of all of our products for their
      approved indications.

geodon/zeldox, a
      psychotropic agent, is a dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist
      indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute manic or mixed
      episodes associated with bipolar disorder. it is available in both an oral
      capsule and rapid-acting intramuscular formulation. geodon worldwide
      revenues were flat in the second quarter of 2009 and decreased 3% in the
      first six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, due to
      increased generic competition, slow growth in the antipsychotic market in
      the u.s. as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. geodon is
      supported by pfizer’s recently launched psychiatric field force and
      geodon’s efficacy and favorable tolerability and metabolic
      profiles.











·  


celebrex, a treatment
      for the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and
      acute pain in adults, experienced a decrease in worldwide revenues of 7%
      in both the second quarter and first six months of 2009, compared to the
      same periods in 2008, due to increased generic competition. celebrex is
      supported by continued educational and promotional efforts highlighting
      its efficacy and safety profile for appropriate
  patients.











·  


zyvox is the world’s
      best-selling branded agent for the treatment of certain serious
      gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant
      staphylococcus-aureus (mrsa). mrsa remains a serious and growing threat in
      hospitals and the community. zyvox is an excellent first-line choice for
      the treatment of adults and children with complicated skin and skin
      structure infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia due to known or
      suspected mrsa. zyvox is the only fda-approved agent for mrsa that offers
      intravenous and oral formulations for these indications. its unique

      revenues decreased 12% in the second quarter of 2009 and 2% in the first
      six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, mainly due to a
      decrease in the number of patients treated for pneumonia and to increased
      generic competition in the u.s. as well as competition from recently
      launched agents in certain high-volume international markets such as the
      u.k.

animal
health revenues decreased 9% in the second quarter of 2009, and 11% in the first
six months of 2009, compared to the same periods in 2008, due to the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange.

animal
health year-to-date revenue performance was also negatively impacted by the
following:






·  


the
      global recession, which negatively affected global spending on veterinary
      care;











·  


historically
      low milk prices, which have hurt the profitability of dairy farmers and
      negatively impacted our livestock business;
and

product
developments

we
continue to invest in r&d to provide future sources of revenues through the
development of new products, as well as through additional uses for existing
in-line and alliance products, and we have taken important steps to prioritize
our research and development portfolio to maximize value. after a review of all
our therapeutic areas, in 2008, we announced our decision to exit certain
disease areas and give higher priority to the following disease areas:
alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, inflammation/immunology, oncology, pain and
psychoses (schizophrenia). we will also continue to work in many other disease
areas, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, genitourinary,
infectious diseases, ophthalmology, smoking cessation, thrombosis and
transplant, among others. these decisions did not affect our portfolio of
marketed products, the development of compounds then in phase 3 or any launches
planned through 2011. notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to
when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for
existing products or any of our other products in development.

we remain
on track to achieve the r&d goals that we announced in march 2008. we now
expect to advance 15 new molecular entities and new indications to phase 3
during the 2008-2009 period; our original target was 15-20 such advancements
during that period. we continue to expect to have a total of 24 to 28 programs
in phase 3 by the end of 2009 and to make 15 to 20 regulatory submissions during
the 2010-2012 period.

in june
2009, we resubmitted a data package to the fda for lyrica for the treatment of
generalized anxiety disorder (gad) monotherapy in response to a “not-approvable”
letter issued by the fda in august 2004.

in april
2009, we and gsk announced that we entered into an agreement to create a new
company focused solely on research, development and commercialization of hiv
medicines. we will contribute selzentry/celsentri (maraviroc), among other
assets, to that company (see further discussion in the “our strategic
initiatives - strategy and recent transactions: acquisitions, licensing and
collaborations” section of this md&a).

in june
2009, an fda advisory committee concluded that geodon is effective for the
treatment of bipolar disorders in children ages 10 to 17. eight members of the
committee also concluded that geodon is acceptably safe for that indication,
with one committee member disagreeing and nine additional committee members
abstaining.

we
received “not-approvable” letters from the fda for fablyn (lasofoxifene) for the
prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis in september 2005 and for the
treatment of vaginal atrophy in january 2006. we submitted a new nda for the
treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women in december 2007, including
the three-year interim data from the postmenopausal evaluation and
risk-reduction with lasofoxifene (pearl) study in support of the new nda. in
september 2008, nine of the 13 members of an fda advisory committee concluded
that there is a population of women with post-menopausal osteoporosis for which
the benefit of treatment with fablyn is likely to outweigh the risks. we
received a “complete response” letter from the fda in january 2009.
subsequently, following a strategic review, we decided to explore strategic
options for fablyn, including out-licensing or sale.

in
september 2008, boehringer ingelheim (bi), our alliance partner, received a
“complete response” letter from the fda for the spiriva respimat submission. the
fda is seeking additional data, and we are coordinating with bi, which is
working with the fda to provide the additional information. a full response will
be submitted to the fda upon the completion of ongoing studies.

in
september 2007, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for zmax that
sets forth requirements to obtain approval for the pediatric acute otitis media
(aom) indication based on pharmacokinetic data. a supplemental filing for
pediatric aom and sinusitis remains under review.

in
december 2005, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for our vfend
pediatric filing, which sets forth the additional requirements for approval. we
have been systematically working through these requirements and addressing the
fda’s concerns, including initiation of an additional pharmacokinetics study in
november 2008.

in june
2008, we completed the acquisition of encysive pharmaceuticals inc. (encysive),
whose main asset is thelin. in june 2007, encysive received a third “approvable”
letter from the fda for thelin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial
hypertension (pah). we began an additional phase 3 clinical trial in patients
with pah during the fourth quarter of 2008 to address the concerns of the fda
regarding efficacy as reflected in that letter.

in
february 2009, fablyn received approval in europe for the treatment of
osteoporosis. subsequently, following a strategic review, we decided to explore
strategic options for fablyn, including out-licensing or sale.

in april,
2009, the european medicines agency’s committee for medicinal products for human
use (chmp) issued a negative opinion, recommending that the european commission
not add an indication for the treatment of fibromyalgia to the marketing
authorization for lyrica. the chmp was of the opinion that the benefits of
lyrica in the treatment of fibromyalgia did not outweigh its risks. on july 23,
2009, the chmp confirmed the negative opinion for the treatment of fibromyalgia
for lyrica. as a result, this indication will not be added to the marketing
authorization for lyrica in the eu. lyrica remains approved in europe for the
indications of neuropathic pain, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and
gad.

in early
2009, we had four phase 3 studies evaluating sutent in advanced breast cancer.
in march 2009, we discontinued a phase 3 trial of single-agent sutent versus
xeloda (capecitabine) for treatment of advanced breast cancer. in june 2009, we
discontinued another phase 3 trial that compared sutent plus taxol (paclitaxel)
to avastin (bevacizumab) plus taxol as first-line treatment of advanced breast
cancer. both studies were discontinued due to futility. we continue to study
sutent in advanced breast cancer in two other phase 3 trials, which have
completed enrollment. in june 2009, we discontinued a phase 3 trial of sutent
for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer due to
futility.

      squibb company (bms).






the phase
3 clinical trial of apixaban for the prevention of stroke in patients with
atrial fibrillation, a potentially significant indication, is event driven. as
such, it is not possible to predict with certainty when the results of this
trial will be available.  bms currently expects to have data from this
trial in mid-2011 and to file for u.s. regulatory approval for this indication
later in 2011 depending on the results of the trial.

additional
product-related programs are in various stages of discovery and development.

acquisition-related
in-process research and development charges

as
required through december 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (ipr&d) was expensed at acquisition
date. ipr&d of $156 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2008,
primarily related to our acquisitions of encysive and serenex. ipr&d of $398
million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008, primarily related to our
acquisitions of covx and coley and two smaller acquisitions related to animal
health. as a result of adopting sfas no. 141r, business combinations, as
amended, beginning january 1, 2009, ipr&d related to future acquisitions
will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as indefinite-lived
intangible assets. no acquisitions were consummated in the first six months of
2009. in the second quarter of 2009, we resolved a contingency associated with
covx and recognized $20 million in acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges.

cost-reduction
initiatives

during
2008, we completed the cost-reduction initiatives which were launched in early
2005, broadened in october 2006 and expanded in january 2007. these initiatives
were designed to increase efficiency and streamline decision-making across the
company and change the way we run our businesses to meet the challenges of a
changing business environment, as well as take advantage of the diverse
opportunities in the marketplace.

we have
generated net cost reductions through site rationalization in r&d and
manufacturing, streamlining organizational structures, sales force and staff
function reductions, and increased outsourcing and procurement savings. these
and other actions have allowed us to reduce costs in support services and
facilities.

on
january 26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new cost-reduction
initiative that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs
of approximately $3 billion, based on the actual foreign exchange rates in
effect during 2008, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total
costs. we expect that this program will be completed by the end of 2010, with
full savings to be realized by the end of 2011. we plan to reinvest
approximately $1 billion of these savings in the business, resulting in an
expected $2 billion net decrease compared to our 2008 adjusted total costs. for
an understanding of adjusted income, see the “adjusted income” section of this
md&a.

the
actions associated with our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in restructuring
charges, such as asset impairments, exit costs and severance costs (including
any related impacts to our benefit plans, including settlements and
curtailments) and associated implementation costs, such as depreciation arising
from the shortening of the useful lives of certain assets, primarily associated
with supply network transformation efforts and expenses associated with system
and process standardization and the expansion of shared services
worldwide.

the
strengthening of the dollar relative to the euro, u.k. pound, canadian dollar,
australian dollar and other currencies, while unfavorable on revenues, has had a positive
impact on our total expenses (cost of sales, selling,
informational and administrative expenses, and research and development
expenses), including the reported impact of these cost-reduction
efforts.

transaction
      costs include banking, legal, accounting and other costs directly related
      to our pending acquisition of wyeth. substantially all of the costs
      incurred to date are fees related to a $22.5 billion bridge term loan
      credit agreement entered into with certain financial institutions on march
      12, 2009, to
      partially fund our pending acquisition of wyeth. the bridge term loan
      credit agreement was terminated in june 2009 as a result of our issuance
      of approximately $24.0 billion of senior unsecured notes during the first
      six months of 2009. all bridge term loan commitment fees have been
      expensed, and we are no longer subject to the covenants under that
      agreement. (see note 8d:
      financial instruments: long-term
debt).










(b)


pre-integration
      costs and other in the 2009 periods primarily represent external,
      incremental costs of integration planning that are directly related to our
      pending acquisition of wyeth and include costs associated with preparing
      for systems and other integration
activities.










(c)


included
      in restructuring charges
      and acquisition-related

other (income)/deductions -
net

other
(income)/deductions - net decreased $239 million in the second quarter of 2009
and $515 million in the first six months of 2009, compared to the same periods
in 2008. in the second quarter of 2009 we recorded net interest expense of $66
million, compared to $99 million net interest income in the same period in 2008,
and in the first six months of 2009, we recorded net interest income of $49
million, compared to $302 million net interest income in the same period in
2008. the lower net interest income for the second quarter and first six months
ended june 28, 2009 is primarily due to net interest expense associated with the
$13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes that we issued in march 2009 and the
approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes that we issued in june
2009 primarily related to the pending acquisition of wyeth. in addition, lower
interest rates, partially offset by higher cash balances, contributed to the
lower net interest income compared to the prior-year periods.

provision for taxes on
income

our
effective tax rate for continuing operations was 25.8% for the second quarter of
2009, compared to 0.9% for the second quarter of 2008, and 27.1% for the first
six months of 2009, compared to 12.4% for the first six months of 2008. the
higher tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 are
primarily due to the increased tax costs associated with certain business
decisions executed to finance the pending wyeth acquisition, partially offset by
the change in geographic mix of expenses incurred to execute our cost-reduction
initiatives, as well as the decrease in ipr&d charges, which generally are
not deductible for tax purposes. the lower tax rates in the second quarter and
first six months of 2008 reflect tax benefits of $305 million related to
favorable tax settlements for multiple tax years and $426 million related to the
sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies, which were both recorded in the
second quarter of 2008.

adjusted
income

general description of
adjusted income measure

adjusted
income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe
that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this
performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results
of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and
sale of prescription medicines for humans and animals––prior to considering
certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income
attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for
acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain
significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed
as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income.

the
adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we
measure the performance of the overall company on this basis, in conjunction
with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted
income measure is utilized.






·  


senior
      management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is
      prepared on an adjusted income
basis;











·  


our
      annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis;
    and











·  


senior
      management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted
      income measure. adjusted income is one of the performance metrics utilized
      in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual
      incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the
      executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code
      section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are
      funded from a pool based on the achievement of three financial metrics,
      including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from
      adjusted income. these metrics derived from adjusted income account for
      (i) 17% of the target bonus for elt members and (ii) 33% of the bonus pool
      made available to elt members and other members of senior
      management.






despite
the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance
measurement, we stress that adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that
has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits
in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition,
adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the
calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented
solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our
performance.

we also
recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income
measure has limitations and we do not restrict our performance-management
process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is
that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a
period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased
intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other
companies in the pharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically
tailored tools designed to ensure the highest levels of our performance. for
example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its
effectiveness is measured. in addition, performance share awards grants made in
2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and future years will be paid based on a
non-discretionary formula that measures our performance using relative total
shareholder return.

purchase accounting
adjustments

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering certain significant
purchase-accounting impacts, such as those related to business combinations and
net asset acquisitions (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements
– note 3.
acquisitions).
these impacts can include charges for purchased in-process r&d, the
incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was
written up to fair value and the incremental charges related to the amortization
of finite-lived intangible assets for the increase to fair value. therefore, the
adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the
acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant
charges.

certain
of the purchase-accounting adjustments associated with a business combination,
such as the amortization of intangibles acquired in connection with our
acquisition of pharmacia in 2003, can occur for up to 40 years (these assets
have a weighted-average useful life of approximately nine years), but this
presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by
management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination
of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management
and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a
degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research
and development costs have been previously expensed.







43









however,
a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and
acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this
component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items
listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the
impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we
had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this
approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have
occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs
in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to
commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our
costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts
may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there
can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as
presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible
assets.

acquisition-related
costs

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering integration and restructuring costs
associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each
transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate
two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity,
only transaction costs and restructuring and integration activities that are
associated with a purchase business combination or a net-asset acquisition are
included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the
resulting synergies.

we
believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides
investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs
incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate
duplicate assets, activities or employees –– a natural result of acquiring a
fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs
incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to
eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business
combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more
normal business contexts.

the
integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may
occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three
years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for
some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and
integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated
nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take
several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation
and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory
authorities.

discontinued
operations

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in
discontinued operations as well as any related gains or losses on the sale of
such operations. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors
because, while we review our businesses and product lines periodically for
strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with an
intent to sell them.

certain significant
items

adjusted
income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain
significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an
individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the
qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may
represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as
a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our
normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items
that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of
items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major
non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs
for a program which is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those
related to our cost-reduction initiatives; charges related to certain sales or
disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued
operations as defined by u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transition service
agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible
asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax
positions;
the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; net
interest expense incurred through the consummation date of the pending
acquisition of wyeth on acquisition-related borrowings made prior to that date;
or possible charges related to legal matters, such as certain of those discussed
in legal proceedings in
our form 10-k and in part ii: other information; item 1.
legal proceedings,
included in our form 10-q filings. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company
or settlements and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our
business would not be considered certain significant items.

in
      the second quarter of 2009, we recorded $20 million of acquisition-related in-process
      research and development charges (ipr&d) due to the resolution
      of a contingency associated with our 2008 acquisition of covx. in the
      second quarter of 2008, we expensed $156 million of ipr&d, primarily

we rely
largely on operating cash flow, short-term investments, short-term commercial
paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for the working capital needs of
our operations, including our r&d activities. we believe that we have the
ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs
for the foreseeable future. the overall increase in net financial assets, as
shown above, reflects cash flows from operating activities partially offset by
dividend payments. the significant changes in the components of net financial
assets, as shown above, are as follows:






·  


on
      january 26, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger
      agreement under which we will acquire wyeth in a cash-and-stock
      transaction valued on that date at $50.19 per share, or a total of $68
      billion. we issued $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on march 24,
      2009 and approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes on june 3,
      2009, of which virtually all of the proceeds will be used to partially
      finance our pending acquisition of wyeth. the note proceeds were generally
      invested in short-term available-for-sale investments. our long-term debt
      increased in the first six months of 2009 primarily as a result of the
      issuances of these senior unsecured
notes.











·  


our
      short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality,
      investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. wherever possible,
      cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to
      provide working capital to our operations. where local restrictions
      prevent intercompany financing, working capital needs are met through
      operating cash flows and/or external borrowings. our portfolio of
      financial assets increased in the first six months of 2009 as a result of
      the proceeds of the notes issued in anticipation of the acquisition of
      wyeth.






credit
ratings

two major
corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s investors service (moody’s) and
standard & poor’s (s&p), assign ratings to our short-term and long-term
debt. the following chart reflects the current ratings assigned by these rating
agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit enhanced
long-term debt issued by us:

on
january 26, 2009, after our announcement that we had entered into a definitive
merger agreement under which we will acquire wyeth, moody’s put us on review for
possible downgrade and s&p put us on credit watch with negative outlook
implications. on march 11, 2009, moody’s downgraded our long-term-debt credit
rating to aa2, its third-highest investment grade rating. the downgrade reflects
moody’s assessment that pfizer’s stand-alone credit quality had deteriorated
based on the approaching lipitor patent expiration. we do not expect the wyeth
acquisition to impact our credit ratings for commercial paper, but we do expect
a possible reduction in our long-term debt ratings, from aa2/negative to
a1/stable long term (moody’s) and from aaa/negative to aa/stable long term
(s&p).







47









following
our issuances of senior unsecured notes in march and june 2009 to partially
finance the pending acquisition of wyeth, we terminated the bridge term loan
credit agreement that we had entered into with certain financial institutions in
march 2009 in connection with the wyeth transaction. as the result of the
termination of that agreement, we no longer are subject to the financial
covenants that were included therein, including the requirement that we maintain
specified minimum credit ratings.

debt
capacity

we have
available lines of credit and revolving-credit agreements with a group of banks
and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent
balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other
short-term borrowings. as of june 28, 2009, we had access to $8.3 billion of
lines of credit, of which $6.1 billion expire within one year. of these lines of
credit, $8.1 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us
$7.0 billion at our request. unused lines of credit of $7.0 billion, of which
$5.0 billion expire in 2010 and $2.0 billion expire in 2013, may be used to
support our commercial paper borrowings.

in march
2007, we filed a securities registration statement with the securities and
exchange commission. this registration statement was filed under the automatic
“shelf registration” process available to “well-known seasoned issuers” and is
effective for three years. we can issue securities of various types under that
registration statement at any time, subject to approval by our board of
directors in certain circumstances. on march 24, 2009, in order to partially
finance our pending acquisition of wyeth, we issued $13.5 billion of senior
unsecured notes under this registration statement.

on june
3, 2009, also in order to partially finance the pending wyeth acquisition, we
issued approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in a private
placement pursuant to regulation s under the securities act of 1933, as amended.
the notes were offered overseas and may not be sold in the united states. as a
result of the issuances of the senior unsecured notes during the first six
months of 2009, the $22.5 billion bridge term loan credit agreement, which we
entered into on march 12, 2009, to partially fund our pending acquisition of
wyeth, was terminated.

for
additional information related to our long-term debt, see notes to condensed
consolidated financial statements - note 8d. financial instruments:
long-term debt.

financial risk
management

due to
the pending acquisition of wyeth and in light of current market conditions, we
currently borrow primarily on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. we may change this
practice as market conditions change.

changes in global financial
markets

towards
the end of the third quarter of 2008, dramatic changes in the global financial
markets weakened global economic conditions. these changes have not had, nor do
we anticipate they will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our
significant operating cash flow, financial assets, access to the capital markets
and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to
believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable
future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity
position.

goodwill and other
intangible assets

as of
june 28, 2009, goodwill
totaled $21.8 billion (16% of our total assets) and identifiable intangible assets, less
accumulated amortization, totaled $16.6 billion (12% of our total
assets). as of june 28, 2009, finite-lived intangible assets, net, include $12.7
billion related to developed technology rights and $511 million related to
brands. indefinite-lived intangible assets include $2.9 billion related to
brands.

at least
annually, we review all of our intangible assets, including goodwill, for
impairment. for goodwill, volatility in securities markets and changes in
pfizer’s market capitalization can impact these calculations. we had no
significant impairments in the second quarter and first six months of 2009 or
2008. none of our goodwill is impaired as of june 28, 2009.

      total pfizer inc. shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of

the
increases in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and loans,
working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, as of
june 28, 2009, compared to december 31, 2008, were primarily due to the
investment of the proceeds from our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior
unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2009 and our issuance of approximately
$10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in the second quarter of 2009, primarily
in anticipation of our acquisition of wyeth, as well as the timing of accruals,
cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business. the increase in
accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, reflects an increase
in alliance-related receivables, as a result of higher associated revenues, an
increase in certain government receivables and an increase due to foreign
currency impacts; no collectibility issues have been identified.

net cash provided by
operating activities

during
the first six months of 2009, net cash provided by operating activities was $7.7
billion, compared to $8.3 billion in the same period of 2008. the slightly lower
net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the
timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.

the cash
flows statement line item other non-cash adjustments
reflects approximately $400 million of asset write-downs in the first six months
of 2008, mainly associated with assets held for
sale.

net cash used in investing
activities

during
the first six months of 2009, net cash used in investing activities was $26.6
billion, compared to $8.9 billion in the same period in 2008. the increase in
net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to net
purchases of investments of $26.4 billion in the first six months of 2009,
primarily reflecting the investment of proceeds from our issuance of $13.5
billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2009 and the proceeds
from our issuance of approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in
the second quarter of 2009, compared to $6.9 billion in the same period in
2008.

net cash provided by/(used
in) financing activities

during
the first six months of 2009, net cash provided by financing activities was
$19.0 billion, compared to net cash used of $1.9 billion in the same period in
2008. the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily
attributable to:






·  


net
      borrowings of $22.3 billion in the first six months of 2009, primarily
      reflecting the proceeds from our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior
      unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2009 and our issuance of
      approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in the second
      quarter of 2009, compared to $2.8 billion in the same period in
      2008;











·  


lower
      dividend payments in 2009;
and











·  


no
      open market purchases of common stock in
2009.






in june
2005, we announced a $5 billion share-purchase program. in june 2006, the board
of directors increased the share purchase authorization from $5 billion to $18
billion. in january 2008, we announced a new $5 billion share-purchase program,
to be funded by operating cash flows, that may be utilized from time to time. on
january 26, 2009, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger
agreement under which we will acquire wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction. the
merger agreement limits our stock purchases to a maximum of $500 million without
wyeth’s consent prior to the completion of the transaction.







49









contractual
obligations

during
the first six months of 2009, we issued approximately $24.0 billion in senior
unsecured notes. virtually all of the proceeds of the notes will be used to
partially finance our pending acquisition of wyeth. the table below presents our
long-term debt obligations by fiscal year as of june 28, 2009. there were no
other significant changes to our contractual obligations as reported in our form
10-k for the year ended december 31, 2008.

our
      long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and
      interest obligations. our calculation of expected interest payments
      incorporates only current-period assumptions for interest rates, foreign
      currency translation rates and hedging strategies. (see notes to
      consolidated financial statements—note 8d. financial
      instruments: long-term debt). long-term debt consists of senior,
      fixed-rate and floating-rate, unsecured notes, foreign currency
      denominated notes, and other borrowings and
  mortgages.






off-balance sheet
arrangements

in the
ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and
businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities
that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to
activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to
environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent
infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim
pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse
the loss. these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts,
specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we
have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of june 28,
2009, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications
are not significant.

certain
of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the
rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial
conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to
certain of our products.

dividends on common
stock

in
january 2009, in connection with the pending acquisition of wyeth, the board of
directors determined that, effective with the dividend to be paid in the second
quarter of 2009 and in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, it
would reduce our quarterly dividend per share of common stock to $0.16. in june
2009, the board of directors declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.16 per
share. the merger agreement prohibits us from declaring a quarterly dividend on
our common stock in excess of $0.16 per share without wyeth’s consent prior to
the completion of the transaction.

outlook

while our
revenues and income will continue to be tempered in the near term due to patent
expirations and other factors, we will continue to make the investments
necessary to sustain long-term growth. we remain confident that pfizer has the
organizational strength and resilience, as well as the strategies, financial
depth and flexibility, to succeed in the long term. however, no assurance can be
given that the factors described above under “our operating environment” or
below under “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future
results” or other significant factors will not have a material adverse effect on
our business and financial results.

our 2009
guidance reflects the projected impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar,
increased pension expenses and lower interest income. it also reflects an
increase in the effective tax rate associated with certain business decisions
executed to finance the pending wyeth acquisition.

on july
22, 2009, at current exchange rates, we narrowed our guidance for 2009 revenues
to a range of $45.0 billion to $46.0 billion from $44.0 billion to $46.0
billion, and we increased our guidance for 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per
common share (eps) to a range of $1.90 to $2.00 from $1.85 to $1.95. we also
increased our guidance for 2009 reported diluted eps attributable to pfizer inc.
common shareholders to a range of $1.30 to $1.45 from $1.20 to $1.35, primarily
due to lower than anticipated costs to be incurred in 2009 in connection with
our cost-reduction initiatives.

on
january 26, 2009, we announced the implementation of a new cost-reduction
initiative that we anticipate will achieve a reduction in adjusted total costs
of approximately $3 billion, based on the actual foreign exchange rates in
effect during 2008, by the end of 2011, compared with our 2008 adjusted total
costs. we expect that this program will be completed by the end of 2010, with
full savings to be realized by the end of 2011. we plan to reinvest
approximately $1 billion of these savings in the business, resulting in an
expected $2 billion net decrease by the end of 2011 compared to our 2008
adjusted total costs. for an understanding of adjusted income, see the “adjusted
income” section of this md&a.

as
referenced in this section, “current exchange rates” is defined as rates
approximating foreign currency spot rates in july 2009.

given
these and other factors, a reconciliation, at current exchange rates and
reflecting management’s current assessment, of 2009 adjusted income and adjusted
diluted eps guidance to 2009 reported net income attributable to pfizer inc. and

our 2009
forecasted financial performance guidance is subject to a number of factors and
uncertainties, as described in the “forward-looking information and factors that
may affect future results” section of this md&a.







51









forward-looking information
and factors that may affect future results

the
securities and exchange commission (sec) encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. this report and other
written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain such
forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on
management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to
identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,”
“forecast,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any
discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans and
prospects. in particular,
these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and
prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or
results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal
proceedings, and financial results. among the factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially are the following:






·  


success
      of research and development
activities;











·  


decisions
      by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve our drug
      applications, as well as their decisions regarding labeling and other
      matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of our
      products;











·  


speed
      with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product
      launches may be achieved;











·  


success
      of external business-development
activities;











·  


competitive
      developments, including with respect to competitor drugs and drug
      candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by
      our in-line drugs and drug
candidates;











·  


ability
      to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and
      internationally;











·  


difficulties
      or delays in manufacturing;











·  


trade
      buying patterns;











·  


ability
      to meet generic and branded competition after the loss of patent
      protection for our products and competitor
  products;











·  


impact
      of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product
      exclusivity;











·  


trends
      toward managed care and healthcare cost
  containment;











·  


u.s.
      legislation or regulatory action, including legislation or regulatory
      action that may result from pending and possible future healthcare reform
      proposals, affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical product pricing,
      reimbursement or access, including under medicaid, medicare and other
      publicly funded or subsidized health programs; the importation of
      prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by
      governments of various foreign countries; direct-to-consumer advertising
      and interactions with healthcare professionals; and the use of comparative
      effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that
      focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic
      differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to
      innovative medicines;











·  


impact
      of the medicare prescription drug, improvement, and modernization act of
      2003;











·  


legislation
      or regulatory action in markets outside the u.s. affecting pharmaceutical
      product pricing, reimbursement or
access;











·  


contingencies
      related to actual or alleged environmental
  contamination;











·  


claims
      and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line
      products and product
candidates;

we cannot
guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we
believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of
anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and
inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results
could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or
projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking
statements.

we
undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised,
however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our
form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports to the securities and exchange
commission.

our form
10-k filing for the 2008 fiscal year listed various important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from projected and historic results.
we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that
filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that
form 10-k in this filing and investors should refer to it. you should understand
that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently,
you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential
risks or uncertainties.

this
report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various
in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of
a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates,
and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body
of data.

legal proceedings and
contingencies

we and
certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product liability,
consumer, commercial, securities, environmental and tax litigations and claims;
government investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to
time in the ordinary course of our business. we do not believe any of them will
have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

we record
accruals for income tax contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a tax
position is not sustainable under a “more likely than not” standard, and we
record our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that
could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction when
we conclude that the potential recovery is more likely than not. we record
accruals for all other contingencies to the extent that we conclude their
occurrence is probable and the related damages are estimable, and we record
anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when assured of
recovery. if a range of liability is probable and estimable and some amount
within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within
the range, we accrue that amount. if a range of liability is probable and
estimable and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than
any other amount within the range, we accrue the minimum of such probable range.
many claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, label warnings,
scientific evidence, actual damages and other matters. often these issues are
subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of loss and
an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. consequently, we cannot
reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss
in excess of amounts accrued for these contingencies. these assessments can
involve a
series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on
estimates and assumptions. our assessments
are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by
management. litigation is inherently
unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. although we believe we have
substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incur judgments or
enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations in any particular period.

patent
claims include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on
various products or processes. although we believe we have substantial defenses
to these challenges with respect to all our material patents, there can be no
assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases
could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue, which could
lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect
future results of operations.
