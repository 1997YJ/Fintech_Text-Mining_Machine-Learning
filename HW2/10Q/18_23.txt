the first quarter of 2011 was another record quarter for revenue and earnings per share. in
the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisitions of mcafee, inc. and the wireless solutions
(wls) business of infineon, which combined contributed approximately $500 million to our first
quarter revenue. our 2nd generation intel® coretm processor products
(formally code-named sandy bridge) are ramping quickly, which resulted in higher microprocessor
average selling prices in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. we saw
strong consumer sales in emerging markets and strong demand for both enterprise servers and clients
in the first quarter of 2011; however, consumer demand in the u.s. and western europe was soft.
compared to the first quarter of 2010, we realized double digit revenue growth across every major
product segment and across every geographic region. we believe we are on track for another year of
revenue growth over 20 percent and double digit earnings growth.

gross margin in the first quarter of 2011 declined 3.2 percentage points compared to the fourth
quarter of 2010 due to higher 22nm start-up costs, higher platform (microprocessor and chipset)
unit costs, and the impact of the acquisitions. these impacts were partially offset by the benefit
from higher platform average selling prices compared to the fourth quarter. the charges to repair
and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel® 6 series express
chipset family negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 3 percentage points in both
the fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011. we rapidly identified, fixed, and recovered
from the chipset design issue (see “note 19: chipset design issue” in part i, item 1 of this form
10-q).

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we began 2011 with great momentum and we expect to add to that momentum as we invest in developing
new products for smartphones and tablets, such as the launch of the intel®
atomtm processor z670 based platform, formerly codenamed “oak trail,” designed
specifically for tablets. we continue to deliver improvements in our product offerings through our
“tick-tock” technology development cadence and expect to begin production of our 22nm process
technology microprocessors (codenamed “ivy bridge”) by the end of 2011. ivy bridge also introduces the
first three-dimensional transistor design called tri-gate, which is expected to improve performance and energy
efficiency compared to the existing two-dimensional transistor structure. our forecast for capital spending this year has increased from our
previous estimate of $9.0 billion to $10.2 billion. the increase in our capital spending outlook
will allow us to widen our process technology lead as we focus on both 22nm and 14nm process
technology, including building a larger scale 14nm fabrication facility that will allow us to
quickly ramp our leading-edge products. we expect incremental opportunities in unit growth and
product mix as a result of these investments. our capital spending strategy also enables us to
integrate more features and functionality on leading edge process technology that can result in
performance, cost, and power efficiency advantages.

the cash-generating power of our business was evident in the first quarter of 2011 with $4.0
billion of cash from operations. from a financial condition perspective, we ended the first quarter
of 2011 with an investment portfolio of $11.5 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. during the
first quarter of 2011, net cash used for acquisitions was $8.2 billion, we purchased $2.7 billion
in capital assets, repurchased $4.0 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase
program, and returned $1.0 billion to stockholders through dividends (a per share increase of 15%
from the fourth quarter).

strategy

our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital
economy. we believe that the proliferation of the internet and cloud computing have driven
fundamental changes in the computing industry. we are transforming from a company with a primary
focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for pcs and servers to a computing
company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and
supporting services. the number and variety of devices connected to the internet is growing, and
computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience. end users value consistency across
devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the internet and to each other. we will help to
enable this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing: energy-efficient
performance, connectivity, and security.




 
•
 
energy-efficient performance. we are focusing on improved energy-efficient
performance for computing and communications systems and devices. improved energy-efficient
performance involves balancing higher performance with lower power consumption.






 
•
 
connectivity. we are positioning our business to take advantage of the growth
in devices that compute and connect to the internet. in the first quarter of 2011, we
acquired the wls business of infineon. this acquisition enables us to offer a portfolio of
products that covers a broad range of wireless connectivity options by combining the
intel® wifi and intel® wimax technologies with wls’ 2g and 3g
technologies, and creates a combined path to accelerate industry adoption of 4g lte.






 
•
 
security. our goal is to enhance security features through a combination of
hardware and software solutions. this may include identity protection and fraud deterrence;
detection and prevention of malware; securing data and assets; as well as system recovery
and enhanced security patching. in the first quarter of 2011, we acquired mcafee. we
believe this acquisition accelerates and enhances our hardware and software security
solutions, improving the overall security of our platforms.



to succeed in the changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives:




 
•
 
strive to ensure that intel technology remains the best choice for the pc as
well as cloud computing and the data center.






 
•
 
expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new
solutions to the smartphone, the tablet, the tv, the car, and the embedded world.






 
•
 
enable devices that connect to the internet and to each other to create a
continuum of personal computing. this continuum would give consumers a set of secure,
consistent, and personalized computing experiences.






 
•
 
positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our
energy-efficient technology.



32



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

we will use our core assets to meet these objectives. our core assets include our silicon and
process technology, our architecture and platforms, our global presence, our strong relationships
across the industry, and our brand recognition. we believe that applying these core assets to our
key focus areas provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new
technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly. some of our core assets and key focus areas
are:




 
•
 
silicon and manufacturing technology leadership. we have long been a leader in silicon
process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment
and innovation in this critical area. we drive a regular two-year upgrade
cycle—introducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the
next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. we refer to this as
our “tick-tock” technology development cadence. as we continue to drive moore’s law over
the next several years, we believe that the value of this leadership will increase. we aim
to have the best process technology, and unlike most semiconductor companies, we primarily
manufacture our products in our own facilities. this allows us to optimize performance,
reduce our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly.






 
•
 
architecture and platforms. we are now developing a wide range of solutions for
devices that span the computing continuum, from pcs and smartphones to smart tvs and
in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. users want computing experiences that are
consistent and devices that are interoperable. users and developers value consistency of
architecture, which provides a common framework that allows for reduced time to market,
with the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. we believe that we
can meet the needs of both users and developers by offering intel®
architecture-based computing solutions across the computing continuum. we continue to invest in
improving intel architecture so that we can deliver increased value to our customers in
existing market segments and also expand the capabilities of the architecture to meet
end-user and customer needs in adjacent market segments. increasingly, we are delivering
our architecture in the form of platforms. platforms include not only the microprocessor,
but other critical hardware and software ingredients that are necessary to create computing
solutions. we are expanding our platform capabilities with connectivity solutions, new
types of user interfaces, new features and capabilities, and complementary software.






 
•
 
software. we enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing
development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and
operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. we seek to expedite growth in
various market segments, such as the embedded and handheld market segments, through our
software offerings. additionally, we have collaborated with other companies to develop
software platforms optimized for our intel® atomtm processors and
that support multiple hardware architectures as well as multiple operating systems.






 
•
 
customer orientation. our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of
products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. in turn, our products help
enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and
consumers. we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured
to work together to provide an optimized solution compared to components that are used
separately. additionally, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield
innovation and improved technologies for users.






 
•
 
strategic investments. we make investments in companies around the world that
we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support
our key business initiatives. our investments, including those made through our intel
capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate
growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for intel, and expand
global markets for our products.






 
•
 
stewardship. we are committed to developing energy-efficient technology
solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our
environmental impact. we are also committed to helping transform education globally through
our technology, program, and policy leadership, as well as funding through the intel
foundation. in addition, we strive to cultivate a work environment where engaged, energized
employees can thrive in their jobs and in their communities.



our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen
our competitive position as we enter and expand into new market segments. we believe that these new
market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for
notebook and desktop computers. we also believe that increased internet traffic and use of cloud
computing create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for
energy-efficient performance and virtualization.

critical accounting estimates

the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated condensed financial
statements. some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain.
our most critical accounting estimates include:




 
•
 
the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments,
net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;



33



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)




 
•
 
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and
equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating
expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;






 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including
the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes;






 
•
 
the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and






 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross
margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for
a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment.



below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.

non-marketable equity investments

we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from
early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature
companies with established revenue streams and business models. the carrying value of our
non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.7 billion as
of april 2, 2011 ($2.6 billion as of december 25, 2010). the majority of this balance as of april
2, 2011 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. our flash memory market
segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies, llc (imft) and im flash
singapore, llp (imfs) of $1.4 billion ($1.5 billion as of december 25, 2010). for further
information, see “note 10: equity method and cost method investments” in the notes to consolidated
condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of
accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable equity
investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance
sheets.

non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product
development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, other key business factors, and the ability
of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile. the
companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive
lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. these events could
cause our investments to become impaired. in addition, financial market volatility could negatively
affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial
public offerings, mergers, and private sales. for further information about our investment
portfolio risks, see “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q.

we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure
purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is
recognized. we determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market
and income approaches. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of
comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance
multiples. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a
number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, development
stages, and other relevant factors. the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow
model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following
significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed
market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the
risk profile of comparable companies. estimates of market segment size, market segment share,
expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed using historical data and available
market data. the valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account
variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the
investees, the investees’ capital structure, and the terms of the investees’ issued interests.

for non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment
and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that
impact the fair value of the investment, such as:




 
•
 
the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones
and overall business prospects;






 
•
 
the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;






 
•
 
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area,
including adverse regulatory or economic changes;






 
•
 
factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the
investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash;
and






 
•
 
the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.



34



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is
other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes
assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before
disposal. if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the
investment to its fair value. impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $14 million in
the first quarter of 2011. over the past 12 quarters, including the first quarter of 2011,
impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $11 million to $896 million per
quarter. this range included impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008,
primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire
communications, llc.

imft/imfs

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand
products to intel and micron technology, inc. at manufacturing cost. we determine the fair value of
our investment in imft/imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business, which requires the use of
unobservable inputs. unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective
judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. changes in management
estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value
determination. we have not had an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in imft/imfs.

long-lived assets

property, plant and equipment

we assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable.
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant
under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative
industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.
we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by
comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future
undiscounted net cash flows. if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the
related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is
measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair
value. property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair
value only if an impairment charge is recognized.

impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable
independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our
semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the
independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective
judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor
manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the
assets’ new, shorter useful lives. over the past 12 quarters, including the first quarter of 2011,
impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $10 million to $95
million per quarter.

goodwill

goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair
value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. goodwill is allocated to our
reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to
our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit.

we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of
potential impairment exist, to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is
impaired. our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which
goodwill resides to its carrying value. reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an
operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. our reporting units are
consistent with the operating segments identified in “note 25: operating segment information” in
part i, item 1 of this form 10-q.

if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to
that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing.
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of
the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to
determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. if the carrying value of a
reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal
to the difference.

35



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions. our impairment review process uses the income method to estimate the reporting unit’s
fair value and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting
unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and intel’s assumed market
segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’
weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost
of capital of comparable companies. our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment
share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external
sources, and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. the same estimates
are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as
part of our capital budgeting process and for both long-term and short-term business planning and
forecasting. we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow
analysis against available comparable market data. in determining the carrying value of the
reporting unit, we must include an allocation of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets
because of the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity. this
allocation is based on each reporting unit’s relative percentage utilization of our manufacturing
and assembly and test assets.

during the fourth quarter of each of the prior two fiscal years, we completed our annual impairment
reviews and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in either of these years.

identified intangibles

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. recoverability of finite
lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future
undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. we review indefinite lived intangible
assets for impairment quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is
measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the
asset is expected to generate. if it is determined that an individual asset is impaired, the amount
of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of
the impaired asset.

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our
intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by various
factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such
as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. based on our
impairment reviews of our intangible assets, we have not recognized any impairment charges in 2011
or 2010.

income taxes

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement
purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and
deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from
differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement
purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant
changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a
subsequent period.

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery
is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we
will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated condensed balance
sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our
tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.
recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to
holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect
to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes.

36



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we
determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step
requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to
estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we
re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors
such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively
settled issues. determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires
judgment. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax
benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

inventory

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
inventory that is not of saleable quality. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory
requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. the estimate of future demand is
compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. as of april 2, 2011, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1.8
billion and total finished goods inventory of $1.7 billion. the demand forecast is included in the
development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation
and build decisions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation
process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products,
consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the
selling price in relation to the product cost. if our demand forecast for specific products is
greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be
required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.

in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine
normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings
compared to total available capacity. if the factory loadings are below the established normal
capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of
inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would
negatively impact our gross margin. we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. over the
past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter.

loss contingencies

we are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential
claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as
well as product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the
ordinary course of business. an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to
income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated based on the best information available at that time. a loss contingency is
disclosed when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. the
outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product
warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. significant judgment is
required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is
reasonably estimable. with respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing
parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates,
costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customer’s manufacturing process.
at least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our
estimates as additional information becomes available. these revisions could have a material impact
on our results of operations and financial position.

our net revenue for q1 2011, which was a 14 week quarter, increased 25% compared to q1 2010, which
was a 13 week quarter. the increase was due to significantly higher microprocessor average selling
prices as well as higher microprocessor unit sales. revenue from the acquisitions of the wls
business of infineon (now intel mobile communications) and mcafee contributed $496 million to q1
2011 revenue. revenue in the americas, asia-pacific, europe, and japan regions increased by 42%,
23%, 17%, and 11%, respectively, compared to q1 2010.

our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2011 increased $1.4 billion, or 21%, compared to q1 2010.
the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. this increase was partially offset
by a charge of $343 million recorded in the first quarter of 2011 to repair and replace materials
and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel® 6 series express chipset
family. for further information, see “note 19: chipset design issue.”

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 61.4% in q1 2011 from 63.4% in q1 2010. the
decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage
decrease in the pc client group operating segment. we derived a substantial majority of our overall
gross margin dollars in q1 2011 and q1 2010, from the sale of microprocessors in the pc client
group and data center group operating segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross
margin expectations.

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by $1.2 billion, or 17%, in q1 2011 compared
to q1 2010. microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those designed for the notebook and
desktop computing market segments. the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly
higher notebook average selling prices. to a lesser extent, higher notebook and desktop unit sales,
as well as higher desktop average selling prices, also contributed to the increase. the increase in
chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales.

operating income increased by $456 million in q1 2011 compared to q1 2010 due to higher revenue,
partially offset by a charge of $343 million recorded in the first quarter of 2011 to repair and
replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel® 6 series
express chipset family. additionally, start-up costs in q1 2011 were approximately $170 million
higher compared to q1 2010.

data center group

the revenue and operating income for the data center group (dcg) operating segment for q1 2011 and

net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by $593 million, or 32%, in q1 2011 compared to
q1 2010. the increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher
microprocessor unit sales and, to a lesser extent, higher microprocessor average selling prices.
the increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher revenue
from the sale of wired connectivity products and higher chipset unit sales.

operating income increased by $389 million in q1 2011 compared to q1 2010. the increase in
operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue, partially offset by higher
operating expenses compared to q1 2010.

other intel architecture operating segments

the revenue and operating income for the other intel architecture (other ia) operating segments,
including intel mobile communications (imc), the embedded and communications group (ecg), the
netbook and tablet group (ntg), the digital home group (dhg), and the ultra-mobility group (umg),
for q1 2011 and q1 2010 were as follows:

net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by $475 million, or 70%, in q1 2011
compared to q1 2010. the increase was primarily due to imc revenue, an operating segment formed
from the acquisition of the wls business of infineon. to a lesser extent, significantly higher ecg
microprocessor and chipset unit sales and significantly higher ecg microprocessor average selling
prices also contributed to the increase.

operating results for the other ia operating segments declined by $62 million, from an operating
gain of $26 million in q1 2010 to an operating loss of $36 million in q1 2011. the decline in
operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within each of the other ia
operating segments, partially offset by higher revenue.

to a lesser extent, significantly higher revenue from wind river software group.

operating loss for the software and services operating segments increased by $8 million in q1 2011
compared to q1 2010. the impact of higher revenue was mostly offset by higher operating expenses
across each of the software and services operating segments.

research and development. r&d spending increased by $352 million, or 23%, in q1 2011 compared to q1
2010. the increase was primarily due to higher compensation based on an increase in employees as we
invest in programs, as well as an extra work week in q1 2011 compared to q1 2010, and the
acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon, both completed in the first quarter of
2011. these increases were partially offset by lower process development costs as we transitioned
from r&d to manufacturing using our 22nm process technology.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses increased
$261 million, or 17%, in q1 2011 compared to q1 2010. the increase was primarily due to the
acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon, both completed in the first quarter of
2011, and higher compensation based on an increase in employees, as well as an extra work week in
q1 2011 compared to q1 2010.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 29% of net revenue in q1
2011 (30% of net revenue in q1 2010).

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. the increase of $33 million was primarily due to
the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of
infineon, both completed in the first quarter of 2011. for further information, see “note 14:
acquisitions” and “note 17: identified intangible assets” in the notes to consolidated condensed

sale of shares in micron.

other gains in q1 2011 primarily related to gains in our micron equity interest acquired in the
sale of numonyx b.v. in q2 2010, partially offset by the change in fair value of micron equity
options that economically hedge our equity interest. other losses in q1 2010 primarily related to
the change in fair value of micron equity options, established prior to the numonyx sale.

its fiscal year with the calendar year.



status of business outlook

we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with
investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking
statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q, including
any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. at the same time, we will
keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor
relations web site at www.intc.com. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook
published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we
publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the “business outlook” section and other
forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year
in our quarterly earnings releases and securities and exchange commission (sec) filings and at
other times.

from the close of business on june 3, 2011 until our quarterly earnings release is published,
presently scheduled for july 20, 2011, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet period,
the “business outlook” section and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k
filed on april 19, 2011, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be
considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update.
during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our
financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and
any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.

operating activities

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes
in certain assets and liabilities.

cash from
operations for the first quarter of 2011 was $4.0 billion, approximately flat compared to
the first quarter of 2010 due to changes in our working capital, mostly offset by higher net
income.

changes in assets and liabilities as of april 2, 2011 compared to december 25, 2010 included the
following:




 
•
 
accrued compensation and benefits decreased due to payout of 2010 profit-dependant
compensation.


 

 
•
 
income taxes payable increased while income taxes receivable decreased as our u.s.
federal estimated income tax payment for the first quarter of 2011 is paid in the second
quarter.



for the first quarter of 2011, our two largest customers accounted for 34% of net revenue (36% for
the first quarter of 2010) with one of those customers accounting for 18% of our net revenue, and
another customer accounting for 16% of our net revenue. these two largest customers accounted for
33% of net accounts receivable at april 2, 2011 (44% at december 25, 2010).

investing activities

the decrease in cash used for investing activities in the first quarter of 2011, compared to the
first quarter of 2010, was primarily due to net sales and maturities of available-for-sale
investments and trading assets during the first quarter of 2011 as compared to net purchases of
available-for-sale investments and trading assets during the first quarter of 2010. these decreases
were partially offset by higher cash paid for acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, an increase in
capital expenditures as we build and equip our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity.

financing activities

the increase in cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of 2011, compared to the
first quarter of 2010, was primarily due to repurchases of common stock under our authorized common
stock repurchase program during the first quarter of 2011.

equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $11.5 billion ($21.5 billion as of december 25, 2010). the majority of the decrease from
the fourth quarter of 2010 is due to the cash required to fund our acquisition of mcafee in the
first quarter of 2011. in addition to the $11.5 billion, we have $2.7 billion in loans receivable
and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio.
substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with a/a2 or better rated issuers, and
a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aa-/aa3 or better.

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing
authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the
issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the
first quarter of 2011 were $200 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of
april 2, 2011. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of
april 2, 2011. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec,
pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the
next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test;
working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions
or strategic investments.

fair value of financial instruments

when determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we
would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the
asset or liability. see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q.

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at
fair value on a recurring basis. when fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a
discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk and/or intel’s credit risk is factored into
the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate.

marketable debt instruments

as of april 2, 2011, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included
$12.6 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $1.4 billion was classified as
level 1, $10.8 billion as level 2, and $302 million as level 3.

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable
market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. management judgment was
required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market
to be considered active. our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments
generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a
specified period.

of the $10.8 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on
a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 40% of the balance was classified as
level 2 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 60% due to the use of
non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data.

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to
corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when
observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and
non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available.

equity securities

as of april 2, 2011, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis included $1.5 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities
were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical
securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity
securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity
security trades over a specified period.
