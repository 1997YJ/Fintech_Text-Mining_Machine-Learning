overview of our performance and operating environment


our business


our mission is to apply science and our global resources to improve health and well-being at every stage of life. we strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacturing of medicines for people and animals. our diversified global healthcare portfolio includes human and animal biologic and small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as nutritional products and many of the world’s best-known consumer products. every day, we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we also collaborate with other biopharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues ar
e derived from the sale of our products, as well as through alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies.


on october 15, 2009, we completed our acquisition of wyeth and, commencing from the acquisition date, our financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of wyeth. as a result, legacy wyeth operations are reflected in our results of operations and cash flows for first-quarter 2010, but not for first-quarter 2009. legacy wyeth assets and liabilities are reflected in our balance sheets as of april 4, 2010 and december 31, 2009.


our first quarter 2010 performance


revenues in the first quarter of 2010 increased 54% to $16.8 billion, compared to $10.9 billion in the same period in 2009, due to:






·  


the inclusion of revenues from legacy wyeth products of $5.3 billion, which favorably impacted revenues by 48%; and









·  


the favorable impact of foreign exchange, which increased revenues by approximately $733 million, or 7%,





partially offset by:






·  


the net revenue decrease from legacy pfizer products of $137 million, or 1%.





total revenues for the first quarter of 2010 were adversely impacted by $56 million as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation enacted in march 2010.


the significant impacts on revenues for the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, are as follows:

in the first quarter of 2010, u.s. revenues were $7.3 billion, an increase of 47% compared to the same period in 2009, primarily reflecting the inclusion of revenues from legacy wyeth products, which was partially offset by lower revenues from certain legacy pfizer products, increased rebates, partly as a result of the impact of the u.s. healthcare legislation enacted in march 2010, and increased pricing pressures. international revenues were $9.4 billion, an increase of 60% compared with the same period in 2009, which reflected 48% operational growth and a 12% favorable impact of foreign exchange. the increase in operational revenues primarily reflects the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy wyeth products and higher operational revenues from legacy pfizer products.


income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2010 was $2.0 billion, compared to $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2009 reflecting:






·  


expenses associated with the legacy wyeth operations;









·  


the impact of wyeth purchase accounting adjustments on cost of sales and amortization of intangible assets;



 




·


higher restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs;









·  


higher net interest expense, mainly due to the issuance of debt in connection with the acquisition of wyeth, as well as lower interest income; and









·  


an increase in the 2010 effective tax rate (see further discussion in the “provision for taxes on income” section of this md&a),





partially offset by:






·  


increased revenues, primarily reflecting the inclusion of revenues from legacy wyeth products.





u.s. healthcare legislation


principal provisions affecting us
in march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (together, the u.s. healthcare legislation), was enacted in the u.s. this legislation has both current and longer-term impacts on us, as discussed below.


the provisions of the u.s. healthcare legislation are effective on various dates over the next several years. the principal provisions affecting us provide for the following:






·  


an increase, from 15.1% to 23.1%, in the minimum rebate on branded prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries (effective january 1, 2010);









·  


extension of medicaid prescription drug rebates to drugs dispensed to enrollees in certain medicaid managed care organizations (effective march 23, 2010);









·  


expansion of the types of institutions eligible for the “section 340b discounts” for outpatient drugs provided to hospitals meeting the qualification criteria under section 340b of the public health service act of 1944 (effective january 1, 2010);









·  


discounts on branded prescription drug sales to medicare part d participants who are in the medicare “coverage gap”, known as the “doughnut hole” (effective january 1, 2011); and









·  


a non-deductible annual fee payable to the federal government based on a company’s prior-calendar-year share of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs (effective january 1, 2011, with the total fee to be paid each year by the entire pharmaceutical industry increasing annually through 2018).





in addition, the u.s. healthcare legislation includes provisions that affect the cost of certain of our postretirement benefit plans. companies currently are permitted to take a deduction for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the subsidy received from the federal government related to their provision of prescription drug coverage to medicare-eligible retirees. under the u.s. healthcare legislation, effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2012, companies will no longer be able to take that deduction. while the loss of this deduction will not take effect for a few years, under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to account for the impact in the first quarter of 2010, the period when the provision was enacted into law, through a write-off of the deferred tax asset associated with those 
previously expected future income tax deductions. other provisions of the u.s. healthcare legislation relating to our postretirement benefit plans will affect the measurement of our obligations under those plans, but those impacts are not expected to be significant.

current and anticipated financial impacts
in the first quarter of 2010, our revenues were adversely impacted by $56 million compared to the same period last year as a result of the increase in the minimum rebate on branded prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries and the extension of medicaid prescription drug rebates to drugs dispensed to enrollees in certain medicaid managed care organizations and, to a lesser extent, the expansion of the types of institutions eligible for the “340b discounts” for outpatient drugs. we expect that full-year 2010 revenues will be adversely impacted by approximately $300 million as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation. further, we expect that the foregoing provisions, together with discounts on branded prescription drug sales to medicare part d participants who are in the medicare “doughnut hole” and the ann
ual fee based on branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs, will adversely affect revenues by approximately $900 million in 2011 and $800 million in 2012. in view of these anticipated impacts, we have reduced our target revenue range for 2012 by $800 million. however, we have reaffirmed all of the other components of our 2012 financial targets, and we have reaffirmed all components of our 2010 financial guidance. (see the “our financial guidance for 2010” and “our financial targets for 2012” sections of this md&a for additional information.)


in the first quarter of 2010, our income tax expense increased due to, among other things, the write-off of the deferred tax asset of approximately $270 million to account for the loss of the deduction, for tax years beginning after december 31, 2012, of an amount equal to the subsidy from the federal government related to our provision of prescription drug coverage to medicare-eligible retirees. this write-off was recorded in provision for taxes on income in our condensed consolidated statement of income. (for additional information on the impact of this write-off on our first-quarter 2010 effective tax rate, see the “provision for taxes on income” section of this md&a.)


the financial impact of u.s. healthcare reform may be affected by certain additional factors over the next few years, including pending implementation guidance relating to the u.s. healthcare legislation and certain healthcare reform proposals. in addition, the u.s. healthcare legislation requires that, except in certain circumstances, individuals obtain health insurance beginning in 2014, and it also provides for an expansion of medicaid coverage in 2014. it is expected that, as a result of these provisions, there will be a substantial increase in the number of americans with health insurance beginning in 2014, a significant portion of whom will be eligible for medicaid. we anticipate that this will increase demand for pharmaceutical products overall. however, in view of the many uncertainties, we are unable at this time to determin
e whether and to what extent sales of pfizer prescription pharmaceutical products in the u.s. will be impacted.
 
biotechnology products

the u.s. healthcare legislation provides an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilars (also referred to as “follow-on biologics”). innovator biologics were granted 12 years data exclusivity, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. after the data exclusivity period expires, the fda could approve biosimilar versions of innovator biologicals. the regulatory implementation of these provisions is ongoing and expected to take several years. if competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biotechnology products, our biotechnology products may become subject to competition from biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure.
 

our operating environment


industry-specific challenges
the majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in pfizer’s 2009 annual report on form 10-k, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and requires us to address a number of industry-specific challenges, which can significantly impact the sales of our products.  these factors include among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights, the regulatory environment and pipeline productivity, pricing and access pressures and increasing competition among branded products.


we expect that we will lose exclusivity for lipitor in the u.s. in november 2011 and, as a result, will lose the substantial portion of our u.s. revenue from lipitor shortly thereafter.  we have granted watson laboratories, inc. (watson) the exclusive right to sell the authorized generic version of lipitor in the u.s. for a period of five years, which is expected to commence in november 2011. as watson’s exclusive supplier, we will manufacture and sell to watson the atorvastatin for use in this product. while the loss of exclusivity for lipitor will occur at various times in developed markets outside the u.s., we expect to maintain a significant portion of the lipitor revenue in those markets through 2011.  we do not expect that lipitor revenue in emerging markets will be materially impacted by loss of exclusivit
y over the next several years.  in 2009, revenue from lipitor was approximately $5.7 billion in the u.s. and approximately $5.7 billion in markets outside the u.s. (of which approximately $900 million was attributable to emerging markets). we also expect to lose exclusivity for various other products over the next few years, including effexor xr and aricept in the u.s. later this year.


we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasing incidents of infringement whenever appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues – biopharmaceutical – selected product descriptions” section of this md&a. see part ii – other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation.


the overall economic environment
in addition to industry-specific factors, we, like other businesses, continue to face the effects of the weak economy. the impact of the weak economy on our biopharmaceutical operations has been largely in the u.s. market, affecting the performance of products such as lipitor, celebrex and lyrica. we believe that patients, experiencing the effects of the weak economy, including high unemployment levels, and increases in co-pays sometimes are switching to generics, delaying treatments, skipping doses or using less effective treatments to reduce their costs. the weak economy also has increased the number of patients in the medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many states, to formulary restrictions 
limiting access to brand-name drugs, including ours.

despite the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated high quality and investment grade by both standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial con
dition, see the "financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.


foreign exchange risk
a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies including the euro, the u.k. pound, the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. when the dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency our revenues will increase, or have a positive impact, and our expenses will incre
ase, having a negative impact, on net income. likewise, if the dollar strengthens against a specific currency, our revenues will decrease, or have a negative impact, and our expenses will decrease, having a positive impact, on net income. therefore, significant shifts in currencies can impact our short-term results as well as our long-term forecasts or targets.


these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors”, of our 2009 annual report on form 10-k.


our strategic initiatives – strategy and recent transactions


we are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. we view our business-development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate profitable revenue growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business-development opportunities.  the 2012 target revenue range that we have announced (see the “our financial targets for 2012” section of this md&a) contemplates a modest level of business-development activity.  we are especially interested in opportunities in our emerging markets and established p
roducts units and our “invest to win” therapeutic areas––oncology, pain, inflammation, alzheimer’s disease, psychoses, diabetes and vaccines.


in connection with our acquisition of wyeth, we are required to divest certain animal health assets. certain of these assets were sold in 2009.  in 2010, we completed the divestiture of legacy fort dodge animal health livestock business and related assets in australia and entered into agreements for the divestiture of certain animal assets in china, the european union, switzerland and mexico, completion of which is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. it is possible that additional divestitures of animal health assets may be required based on ongoing regulatory reviews in other jurisdictions worldwide.


in the first quarter of 2009, we entered into a five-year agreement with bausch & lomb to co-promote prescription pharmaceuticals in the u.s. for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. the agreement covers prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, including our xalatan product and bausch & lomb’s alrex®, lotemax® and zylet® products, as well as bausch & lomb’s investigational anti-infective eye drop, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%, which currently is under review by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda).


acquisition of wyeth
 
on october 15, 2009 (the acquisition date), we acquired all of the outstanding equity of wyeth in a cash-and-stock transaction, valued at the acquisition date at approximately $68 billion. while wyeth now is a wholly owned subsidiary of pfizer, the merger of local pfizer and wyeth entities may be pending or delayed in various international jurisdictions and integration in these jurisdictions is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory obligations.

in 2009, we recorded provisional amounts for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which were adjusted in the first quarter of 2010 (measurement period adjustments). certain estimated values are not yet finalized (see below) and are subject to change, which could be significant. we will finalize the amounts recognized as we obtain the information necessary to complete the analyses, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 3. acquisition of wyeth.


measurement period adjustments
the measurement period adjustments for identifiable intangible assets reflect changes in the estimated fair value of certain acquired intangibles, principally in-process research and development assets, primarily to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date, such as long-term expectations as to patient population, general market potential, dosing regimens and pricing.  the fair value changes did not result from intervening events subsequent to the acquisition date.


the measurement period adjustments did not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or cash flows in any period and, therefore, we have not retrospectively adjusted our financial statements. in addition, neither the measurement period adjustments nor the underlying scientific and market data leading to the changes impacted our financial guidance for 2010 (see the “our financial guidance for 2010” section of this md&a and in our 2009 annual report on form 10-k) or our financial targets for 2012 (see the “our financial targets for 2012” section in this md&a and in our 2009 annual report on form 10-k).


provisional amounts
the recorded amounts are provisional and subject to change. specifically, the following items are subject to change:






·  


amounts for intangibles and inventory, pending finalization of valuation efforts.









·  


amounts for legal contingencies, pending the finalization of our examination and evaluation of the portfolio of filed cases.









·  


amounts for income tax assets, receivables and liabilities pending the filing of wyeth pre-acquisition tax returns, including all required disclosures and documentation, as well as the receipt of information from taxing authorities which may change certain estimates and assumptions used.









·

the legacy pfizer established products unit was negatively impacted in the first quarter of 2010 by 5% due to the loss of exclusivity for norvasc in canada, offset by the favorable impact of the addition of camptosar’s european revenues as well as the reclassification of revenues from south korea.

biopharmaceutical revenues

worldwide biopharmaceutical revenues for the first quarter of 2010 were $14.5 billion, an increase of 44% compared to the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to:






·  


the inclusion of revenues from legacy wyeth products of approximately $4.1 billion, which favorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by 41%;









·  


the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the euro, australian dollar, canadian dollar, and brazilian real, which favorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by approximately $617 million, or 6%, and









·  


solid operational performance from certain legacy pfizer products, including sutent, lyrica, viagra and geodon, and higher legacy pfizer alliance revenues,





partially offset by:






·  


a decrease in operational revenues, of approximately $260 million, from certain legacy pfizer products, including norvasc and camptosar, as a result of loss of exclusivity, as well as from lipitor and detrol/detrol la.





geographically,






·  


in the u.s., biopharmaceutical revenues increased 40% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from legacy wyeth products of approximately $2.2 billion, which favorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by 47%, which was partially offset by lower revenues from certain legacy pfizer products of $322 million, or 4%, including lipitor, lyrica, detrol and celebrex, compared to the same period in 2009, as a result of continued generic pressures.  revenues from legacy pfizer products also were adversely affected by increased rebates partly as a result of the impact of the u.s. healthcare legislation, and increased pricing pressures. these factors were partially offset by the solid performance from geodon and legacy pfizer alliance revenues in the first quarter of 2010; and







  


28





  

 





·  


in our international markets, biopharmaceutical revenues increased 46% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009. the increase in revenues reflects the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy wyeth products of $1.8 billion, which favorably impacted biopharmaceutical revenues by 34%, higher operational revenues from legacy pfizer products of $60 million, or 1%, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange on international biopharmaceutical revenues of $617 billion, or 11%. the increase in operational revenues of legacy pfizer products was due to operational growth from lipitor, lyrica, sutent, celebrex, viagra and alliance products, partially offset by lower revenues from norvasc and camptosar, due to loss of exclusivity, among others.





during the first quarter of 2010, international biopharmaceutical revenues represented 54% of total biopharmaceutical revenues, compared to 53% in 2009.


effective january 1, 2010, we increased the published prices for certain u.s. biopharmaceutical products. these price increases had no material effect on wholesaler inventory levels in comparison to the prior year.


diversified revenues
 
worldwide diversified revenues in the first quarter of 2010 were $2.1 billion, an increase of 210% compared to the same period in 2009 due to:






·  


the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy wyeth products of approximately $1.2 billion, which favorably impacted diversified revenues by 179%, primarily from the addition of the legacy wyeth consumer healthcare and nutrition operations, the operational revenue increase in legacy pfizer diversified businesses of 15% and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 16%.



 
revenues from animal health products increased 58% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, reflecting the inclusion of operational revenues from legacy wyeth animal health products of 31%, higher operational revenues from legacy pfizer animal health products of 17% and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 10%.


rebates and chargebacks
as is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions, that are generally estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized, and primarily represent rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and managed care organizations for our pharmaceutical products. these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results generally have been less than 1% of biopharmaceutical net sales and can result in either a ne
t increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.

(b)


performance-based contracts are with managed care customers, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers, which receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance terms for products.











(c)


chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.





the above rebates and chargebacks for the first quarter of 2010 were higher than 2009, primarily as a result of:






·  


the inclusion of rebates and chargebacks related to legacy wyeth products;









·  


the impact of increased medicaid rebate rates due to the u.s. healthcare legislation in addition to higher rates for certain products that are subject to rebates; and









·  


the impact of increased chargebacks due to competitive pricing factors,

partially offset by:






·  


changes in product mix, among other factors.





our accruals for medicaid rebates, medicare rebates, performance-based contract rebates and chargebacks totaled $2.5 billion as of april 4, 2010, an increase from $2.1 billion as of december 31, 2009 and primarily are included in current deferred tax liabilities and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

biopharmaceutical – selected product descriptions:






·  


lipitor, for the treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood, is the most widely used branded prescription treatment for lowering cholesterol and the best-selling prescription pharmaceutical product of any kind in the world. lipitor recorded worldwide revenues of $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2010, reflecting 1% growth compared to the same period in 2009. these results, in part, reflect the favorable impact of foreign exchange, which increased revenues by $148 million, or 5%, in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. in the u.s., revenues were $1.3 billion or a decrease of 10% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. internationally, lipitor revenues in the first quarter of 2010 were $1.4 billion, or an increase of 14%, comp
ared to the same period in 2009, with 12% due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange.



 




 



excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, the decrease in lipitor worldwide operational revenues in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009, was driven by a combination of factors, including the following:




 





 

o 



the continuing impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition from multi-source generics and branded products in the u.s.;






 




 

o 



increased payer pressure in the u.s.; and





 




 

o 



slower growth in the lipid-lowering market in the u.s. due, in part, to a slower rate of growth in the medicare part d population and, reflecting weak economic conditions, heightened overall patient cost-sensitivity in the u.s. and adoption of non-prescription treatment options,







 





 



partially offset by:





 





 

o 



operational growth internationally.






 




 



see the “our operating environment––industry-specific challenges” section of this md&a for a discussion concerning the expected loss of exclusivity for lipitor in various markets.










·  


enbrel, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis affecting the spine, recorded worldwide revenues, excluding the u.s. and canada, of $802 million in the first quarter of 2010. enbrel revenues from the u.s. and canada are included in alliance revenues. the approval of competing products for the treatment of psoriasis is expected to increase competition with respect to enbrel in 2010.









 



we have exclusive rights to enbrel outside the u.s. and canada and co-promote enbrel with amgen inc. (amgen) in the u.s. and canada. our co-promotion agreement with amgen expires in october 2013, and we are entitled to a royalty stream for 36 months thereafter, which is significantly less than our current share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canadian sales. our rights to enbrel outside the u.s. and canada will not be affected by the expiration of the co-promotion agreement.










·  


lyrica, indicated for the management of post-herpetic neuralgia (phn), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (dpn), fibromyalgia, and as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures in the u.s., and for neuropathic pain, adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and general anxiety disorder (gad) outside the u.s., recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 6% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. lyrica had a strong operational performance in international markets in the first quarter of 2010. in the u.s., revenues have been adversely affected by increased generic competition, as well as managed care pricing and formulary pressures.









 



see part ii––other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain patent litigation relating to lyrica.










·  


effexor xr (extended release capsules), an antidepressant for treating adult patients with major depressive disorder, gad, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder, recorded worldwide revenues of $716 million in the first quarter of 2010. effexor xr faces generic competition outside the u.s. in the u.s., effexor xr faces competition from a non-ab-rated (i.e., not therapeutically equivalent) generic product. pursuant to a 2005 settlement agreement related to certain patent litigation with wyeth, teva pharmaceuticals usa, inc. and teva pharmaceutical industries, ltd. are permitted to launch generic versions of effexor xr in the u.s. beginning july 1, 2010, subject to possible earlier launch based on specified market conditions or developments regarding the applicable patents rights, including t
he outcome of other generic challenges to such patent rights.

·  


celebrex, a treatment for the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain in adults, experienced an increase in worldwide revenues of 1% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange partially offset by increased generic competition. celebrex is supported by continued educational and promotional efforts highlighting its efficacy and safety profile for appropriate patients.









 



see part ii––other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain product litigation relating to celebrex.










·  


prevnar/prevenar 7, our 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children, recorded worldwide revenues of $520 million in the first quarter of 2010.









·  


viagra remains the leading treatment for erectile dysfunction and one of the world’s most recognized pharmaceutical brands after more than a decade. viagra worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2010 increased 5% compared to the same period in 2009. in the u.s., first quarter 2010 viagra revenues decreased 2% compared to the same period in 2009 and, internationally, revenues increased 16% compared to the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to the favorable impact of foreign exchange.









 



see part ii––other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain patent and product litigation relating to viagra.










·  


xalabrands consists of xalatan, a prostaglandin, the world’s leading branded agent to reduce elevated eye pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and xalacom, a fixed combination prostaglandin (xalatan) and beta blocker (timolol) that is available outside the u.s. xalatan/xalacom worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2010 increased 4% compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange.









·  


norvasc, for treating hypertension, lost exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2007. norvasc also has experienced patent expirations in other major markets, including japan in july 2008 and most recently canada in july 2009. norvasc worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2010 decreased 23% compared to the same period in 2009.









·  


zyvox is the world’s best-selling branded agent for the treatment of certain serious gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus-aureus (mrsa). zyvox worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2010 increased 3% compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to growth in emerging markets and developed markets in europe. revenues have been adversely affected by a decrease in the number of patients treated for pneumonia and by increased generic competition in the u.s., as well as competition from recently launched agents in certain high-volume international markets such as the u.k.









 



see part ii––other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain patent litigation relating to zyvox.










·  


prevnar/prevenar 13, launched in germany in late 2009 and in the u.s. in early 2010 with ongoing launches in other markets in the first quarter of 2010 and beyond, is our 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children, recorded worldwide revenues of $286 million in the first quarter of 2010. to date, prevnar/prevenar 13 has been approved in over 40 countries.









·  


zosyn/tazocin, our broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic, faces generic competition in the u.s. and certain other markets. it recorded worldwide revenues of $264 million in the first quarter of 2010. 









·  


detrol/detrol la, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, is the most prescribed branded medicine worldwide for overactive bladder. detrol la is an extended-release formulation taken once a day. detrol/detrol la worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2010 declined 10%, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased competition from other branded medicines.









·  


sutent is for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gist) after disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate. sutent worldwide revenues increased 28% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. we continue to drive total revenue and prescription growth, supported by cost-effectiveness data and efficacy data in first-line mrcc––including two-year survival data, which represent the first time that overall survival of two years has been seen in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, as well as through access and healthcare coverage. as of april 4, 2010, sutent was the best-selling medicine in the world for the treatment of first-line mrcc.




 




 



on april 7, 2010, the fda requested that we revise the product labeling for sutent to include information regarding the risk of hepatotoxicity as a boxed warning and convert the existing patient package insert to a medication guide for distribution to patients who are dispensed sutent.  the fda also requested a risk mitigation, assessment, and communication plan to ensure that the benefits of sutent treatment continue to outweigh the risks.  revised labeling for the product, which likely will include the addition of a boxed warning to prominently communicate this information, will be issued upon completion of discussions with the fda.










 



pfizer maintains a global safety database, monitoring all sponsored clinical trials and spontaneous adverse event reports. hepatic failure has been uncommonly observed in clinical trials (0.3%) and post-marketing experience, consistent with the very low rate of hepatic failure observed in the clinical trials of sutent used to support original registration in 2006. over 80,000 patients worldwide have been treated with sutent.










 



the risk-benefit profile of sutent in both mrcc and second-line gist has been well-established through large, randomized clinical trials evaluating its safety and efficacy.  sutent remains an important treatment option for these two difficult-to-treat cancers.

our premarin family of products remains the leading therapy to help women address moderate to severe menopausal symptoms. it recorded worldwide revenues of $256 million in the first quarter of 2010.









·  


geodon/zeldox, an atypical antipsychotic, is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar manic or mixed episodes, and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.  geodon recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 10% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, due in part to continued growth in the u.s. antipsychotic market, recent u.s. approval for adjunctive bipolar maintenance therapy in adults, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.

genotropin, the world’s leading human growth hormone, is used in children for the treatment of short stature with growth hormone deficiency, prader-willi syndrome, turner syndrome, small for gestational age syndrome, idiopathic short stature (in the u.s. only) and chronic renal insufficiency (outside the u.s. only), as well as in adults with growth hormone deficiency. genotropin is supported by a broad platform of innovative injection-delivery devices. genotropin worldwide revenues increased 4% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange.









·  


chantix/champix, the first new prescription treatment to aid smoking cessation in nearly a decade, has been launched in all major markets. chantix/champix worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2010 increased 7% compared to the same period in 2009 due to strong performance in developed markets in europe partially offset by the impact of changes to the product’s label and other factors. we are continuing our educational and promotional efforts, which are focused on the chantix benefit-risk proposition, the significant health consequences of smoking and the importance of the physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit smoking.









·  


vfend, as the only branded agent available in intravenous and oral forms, continues to build on its position as the best-selling systemic, antifungal agent worldwide. the overall global revenues of vfend continue to be driven by its acceptance as an excellent broad-spectrum agent for treating yeast and molds. vfend worldwide revenues increased 5% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange.









 



in october 2009, we settled a challenge by mylan, inc. (mylan) and its subsidiary, matrix laboratories limited (matrix), to four of our patents relating to vfend by entering into an agreement granting matrix and another subsidiary of mylan the right to market voriconazole (generic vfend) tablets in the u.s. beginning in the first quarter of 2011.










·  


benefix and refacto/xyntha are our state-of-the-art hemophilia products that offer patients with this lifelong bleeding disorder the potential for a near-normal life. it recorded worldwide revenues of $244 million in the first quarter of 2010.









 



see part ii––other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain patent litigation relating to refacto and xyntha.










·  


caduet, a single-pill therapy combining norvasc and lipitor, recorded virtually flat worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased generic competition, as well as an overall decline in u.s. hypertension market volume.









·  


revatio, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, recorded virtually flat worldwide revenues in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to increased competition.









·  


alliance revenues increased 73% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, due to the strong performance of spiriva, aricept and rebif, as well as the inclusion of sales of enbrel, a legacy wyeth product, in the u.s. and canada. we expect to lose exclusivity for aricept in the u.s. later this year.





product developments – biopharmaceutical


we continue to invest in r&d to provide potential future sources of revenues through the development of new products, as well as through additional uses for existing in-line and alliance products, and we have taken important steps to prioritize our r&d portfolio to maximize value. after a review in 2008 of all our therapeutic areas, we announced our decision to exit certain disease areas and give higher priority to the following disease areas: oncology, pain, inflammation, alzheimer’s disease, psychoses and diabetes. with our acquisition of wyeth, we also have added a focus on vaccines and biologics. while we continue to conduct research across a broad range of diseases, approximately 70% of our research projects and 75% of our late-stage portfolio currently are focused on our higher-priority areas.


in january 2010, we announced the combined company pipeline, comprised of assets from both legacy pfizer and legacy wyeth, which included 133 programs from phase i through registration and showed growth and increased diversity in each of the areas where we invest in r&d.  we remain on track to achieve our previously announced goal of 15 to 20 regulatory submissions in the 2010 to 2012 period.

in december 2009, our co-promotion partner, protalix biotherapeutics, submitted an nda with the fda for taliglucerase alfa. taliglucerase alfa was granted orphan drug designation and fast-track designation by the fda. in november 2009, we entered into a license and supply agreement with protalix biotherapeutics, which provides us exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of gaucher’s disease except in israel.
 

in april 2010, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for genotropin mark vii multidose disposable device submission. we are working with the fda to address the requests and recommendations included in the letter.

 
in june 2009, we resubmitted a data package to the fda for lyrica for the treatment of gad monotherapy in response to a “not-approvable” letter issued by the fda in august 2004. on december 23, 2009, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda with respect to this nda. we are working with the fda to determine the next steps. on january 27, 2010, we announced the withdrawal of the nda for the adjunctive treatment of gad.
 
in june 2009, an fda advisory committee concluded that geodon is effective for the treatment of bipolar mania in children ages 10 to 17. on october 30, 2009, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda with respect to this nda. the fda is seeking additional information and is requesting that we take certain actions with regard to the submission. on april 9, 2010, we received a “warning letter” from the fda with respect to the clinical trial in support of this nda. we are working with the fda to address the requests and recommendations included in the “complete response” letter and the “warning” letter.


boehringer ingelheim (bi), our alliance partner, holds the nda for spiriva. in september 2008, bi received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the spiriva respimat submission. the fda is seeking additional data, and we are coordinating with bi, which is working with the fda to provide the additional information. a full response will be submitted to the fda upon the completion of planned and ongoing studies.


in september 2007, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for zmax that sets forth requirements to obtain approval for the pediatric acute otitis media (aom) indication based on pharmacokinetic data. a supplemental filing for pediatric aom and sinusitis remains under review.


two “approvable” letters were received by wyeth in april and december 2007 from the fda for viviant (bazedoxifene) for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis that set forth the additional requirements for approval. in may 2008, wyeth received an “approvable” letter from the fda for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. the fda is seeking additional data, and we have been systematically working through these requirements and seeking to address the fda’s concerns. in february 2008, the fda advised wyeth that it expects to convene an advisory committee to review the pending ndas for both the treatment and prevention indications. in april 2009, wyeth received approval in the eu for conbriza (the eu trade name for viviant) for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women at increased ris
k of fracture.

in july 2007, wyeth received an “approvable” letter from the fda for pristiq for vasomotor symptoms of menopause that sets forth the additional requirements for approval. we have been systematically working through these requirements and seeking to address the fda’s concerns, including initiation of an additional clinical trial, which is underway.


in december 2005, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for our vfend pediatric filing that sets forth the additional requirements for approval. we have been systematically working through these requirements and seeking to address the fda’s concerns, including initiation of an additional pharmacokinetics study in november 2008.


in june 2008, we completed the acquisition of encysive pharmaceuticals inc. (encysive), whose main asset is thelin. in june 2007, encysive received a third “approvable” letter from the fda for thelin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah). we began an additional phase 3 clinical trial in patients with pah during the fourth quarter of 2008 to address the concerns of the fda regarding efficacy as reflected in that letter.


we are in the process of withdrawing the ndas for fablyn (lasofoxifene), for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. we are exploring strategic options for fablyn, including out-licensing or sale.

tanezumab


an anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody for the treatment of pain



tasocitinib (cp-690,550)


a jak-3 kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis





the phase 3 trial of apixaban for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, is event driven. as such, it is not possible to predict with certainty when the results of this trial will be available.  bms currently expects to have data from this trial in mid-2011 and to file for u.s. regulatory approval for this indication later in 2011 depending on the results of the trial.



our collaboration with janssen ai on bapineuzumab, a potential treatment for alzheimer’s disease, continues with four phase 3 studies continuing to enroll.  in april 2010, johnson & johnson announced that the janssen ai north american studies would complete (last patient out) in mid-2012.  we announced in may 2010 that we expect that the last patient will have completed our 18-month trials, including associated biomarker studies, in 2014.

 

in march 2010, pfizer and medivation, inc. announced that a phase 3 trial of dimebon (latrepiridine) did not meet its co-primary or secondary endpoints. subsequently, we and medivation, inc. agreed to discontinue the constellation and contact phase 3 trials in patients with moderate-to-severe alzheimer’s disease. the 12-month phase 3 concert trial in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease and the six-month phase 3 horizon trial in patients with huntingdon’s disease continue. after completing our evaluation of the data from the trial that did not meet its endpoints, we will determine appropriate next steps regarding the dimebon program.

 
in december 2009, we discontinued a phase 3 trial of figitumumab in first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer for futility. in march 2010, we discontinued a phase 3 trial of figitumumab in second/third line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer for futility.


additional product-related programs are in various stages of discovery and development. also, see the discussion in the “our strategic initiatives––strategy and recent transactions” section of this md&a.


costs and expenses


cost of sales


cost of sales increased 206% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009, which reflects:






·  


purchase accounting charges of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting the fair value adjustments to inventory acquired from wyeth in 2009 that was sold in the first quarter of 2010;









·  


the addition of wyeth’s manufacturing operations; and









·  


the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on cost of sales.







  


36





  




cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2010 increased 12.7 percentage points to 25.7% compared to 13% in the same period in 2009, primarily reflecting the fair value adjustments to inventory acquired from wyeth in 2009 that was sold in the first quarter of 2010, as well as the mix of products and businesses as a result of our acquisition of wyeth, which was not reflected in our first-quarter 2009 results.


selling, informational and administrative expenses


selling, informational and administrative (si&a) expenses increased 54% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009, which reflects:






·  


the addition of wyeth’s operating costs; and









·  


the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.





research and development expenses


research and development (r&d) expenses increased 31% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, which reflects:






·  


the addition of wyeth operating costs;









·  


continued investment in the late-stage development portfolio; and









·  


the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.





acquisition-related in-process research and development charges


in the first quarter of 2010, we resolved certain contingencies associated with our 2008 acquisition of covx and recorded $74 million in acquisition-related in-process research and development charges.


cost-reduction initiatives and acquisition-related costs


we have incurred significant costs in connection with our cost-reduction initiatives (several programs initiated since 2005) and our acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009.
 
as described more fully in our 2009 annual report on form 10-k, since the acquisition of wyeth, our cost-reduction initiatives announced on january 26, 2009, but not completed as of  december 31, 2009, have been incorporated into a comprehensive plan to integrate wyeth’s operations, generate cost savings and capture synergies across the combined company. in the aggregate, with the combination of these two initiatives into one comprehensive program, we expect to generate cost reductions, net of investments in the business, of approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, by the end of 2012, at 2008 average foreign exchange rates, in comparison with the 2008 pro-forma combined adjusted total costs of pfizer and the legacy wyeth operations. (for an understanding of adjusted total costs, see the “adjusted income” section
 of this md&a). we remain on track to meet this target. we have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with these cost-reduction activities and estimate that these costs could be in the range of approximately $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion through 2012, of which we have incurred approximately $6.3 billion in cost-reduction and acquisition-related costs (excluding transaction costs) through april 4, 2010.
 
at the end of the first quarter of 2010, the workforce totaled approximately 113,800, a decrease of 2,700 from december 31, 2009. since the closing of the wyeth acquisition on october 15, 2009, the workforce has declined by 6,900, primarily in the u.s. primary care field force, manufacturing and r&d operations.

included in current deferred tax liabilities and other current liabilities ($2.0 billion) and other noncurrent liabilities ($1.0 billion).





in the first quarter of 2010, the restructuring charges are related to the integration of wyeth. from the beginning of our cost-reduction initiatives in 2005 through april 4, 2010, employee termination costs represent the expected reduction of the workforce by approximately 45,400 employees, mainly in manufacturing, sales and research, of which approximately 28,100 employees have been terminated as of april 4, 2010. employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. asset impairments prima
rily include charges to write down property, plant and equipment to fair value. other primarily includes costs to exit certain assets and activities.

(e)


implementation costs in the first quarter of 2009 represent external, incremental costs directly related to implementing cost-reduction initiatives prior to our acquisition of wyeth and primarily include expenditures related to system and process standardization and the expansion of shared services. for the three months ended march 29, 2009, implementation costs are included in cost of sales ($13 million), selling, informational and administrative expenses ($40 million), research and development expenses ($20 million) and other (income)/deductions — net ($11 million).





other (income)/deductions––net


other (income)/deductions––net changed unfavorably by $471 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, which primarily reflects:




  


38





  

 





·  


higher interest expense of $393 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily associated with the $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes that we issued in march 2009 and the approximately $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes that we issued in june 2009, to partially finance the acquisition of wyeth;









·  


lower interest income of $133 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower interest rates coupled with lower average cash balances; and









·  


slightly higher charges for litigation-related matters,





partially offset by:






·  


higher royalty-related income.





provision for taxes on income


our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 36.0% for the first quarter of 2010, compared to 28.2% for the first quarter of 2009. the higher tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 is primarily the result of:






·  


higher amortization charges, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of wyeth, and the mix of jurisdictions in which those charges were incurred;









·  


the write-off of the deferred tax asset of approximately $270 million related to the medicare part d subsidy for retiree prescription drug coverage, resulting from changes in the u.s. healthcare legislation enacted in march 2010 concerning the tax treatment of that subsidy effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2012;









·  


the expiration of the u.s. research tax credit; and









·  


the increase in non-deductible in-process research and development charges.





these factors were partially offset by $410 million in tax benefits for the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years with various foreign tax authorities.


adjusted income


general description of adjusted income measure
adjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines for humans and animals, consumer healthcare (over-the-counter) products, vaccines and nutritional products––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for 
u.s. gaap net income. adjusted total costs represent the total of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted si&a expenses and adjusted r&d expenses, which are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as and are components of the overall adjusted income measure.
 
the adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted income measure is utilized:






·  


senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income basis;









·  


our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis; and









·  


senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted income measure. adjusted income is one of the performance metrics utilized in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are funded from a pool based on the achievement of three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from adjusted income. beginning in 2010, these metrics derived from adjusted income account for (i) between 7% and 13% of the target bonus for elt members and (ii) 33% of the bonus pool made available to elt members and other members of senior management.



 
despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.




  


39





  

 

we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, the earn-out of performance share award grants is determined based on a non-discretionary formula that measures ou
r performance using relative total shareholder return.


purchase accounting adjustments
adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts, such as those related to business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets acquired from pharmacia and wyeth, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt and charges for purchased in-process r&d. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges.


certain of the purchase accounting adjustments associated with a business combination, such as the amortization of intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition of wyeth in 2009 and pharmacia in 2003, can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research and development costs previously have been expensed.


however, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our mark
eting efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.


acquisition-related costs
adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.


we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.


the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory authorities.

discontinued operations
adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the sale of such operations. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines periodically for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them.


certain significant items
adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term,
 such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction initiatives; charges related to certain sales or disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transition service agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; net interest expense incurred through the consummation date of the acquisition of wyeth on acquisition-related borrowings made prior to that date; or possible charges related to legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in legal proceedings in our 2009 annual report on form 10-k and in part ii. other information; item 1. legal proceedings, in our quarterly reports on form 10-q filings. normal
, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

we rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for the working capital needs of our operations, including our r&d activities. we believe that we have the ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. we believe we have the flexibility to allocate our significant operating cash flows with a continued focus on seeking to provide the highest return for our shareholders, such as potential dividend increases, share repurchases, investments in our business, or by paying down outstanding debt. short-term investments decreased due to the use of proceeds for tax payments made in the first quarter of 2010, associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the wyeth acquisition.



debt capacity
we have available lines of credit and revolving-credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of april 4, 2010, we had access to $8.4 billion of lines of credit, of which $6.2 billion expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.3 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of our unused lines of credit, of which $5.0 billion expire in late 2010 and $2.0 billion expire in 2013, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings.


in march 2010, the shelf registration statement that we previously filed with the sec, pursuant to the shelf registration process available to “well-known seasoned issuers,” expired.

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and loans, as of april 4, 2010, compared to december 31, 2009, was primarily due to the use of proceeds of short-term investments for tax payments made in the first quarter of 2010, associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the wyeth acquisition. the change in working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was due to the timing of accruals, cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business. we are monitoring developments regarding government receivables in several european country markets. no significant collectability issues have been identified.

operating activities


during the first quarter of 2010, net cash used in operating activities was $6.4 billion, compared to net cash provided of $3.1 billion in the same period of 2009. the change in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to:






·  


income tax payments of approximately $10.5 billion, associated with certain business decisions executed to finance the wyeth acquisition; and









·  


the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.



 
in 2010, the cash flow line item called changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures reflects the $10.5 billion of tax payments described above.
 
investing activities


during the first quarter of 2010, net cash provided by investing activities was $9.4 billion, compared to net cash used of $13.6 billion in the same period in 2009. the change in investing cash flows was primarily attributable to:






·  


net proceeds from redemption and sales of investments of $9.5 billion in the first quarter of 2010, which were used for tax payments in the first quarter of 2010, compared to net purchases of investments of $13.6 billion in the first quarter of 2009 primarily reflecting the investment of proceeds from our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2009.





financing activities


during the first quarter of 2010, net cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion, compared to net cash provided of $9.6 billion in the same period in 2009. the change in financing cash flows was primarily attributable to:






·  


net repayments of borrowings of $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2010 compared to net borrowings of $11.8 billion in the first quarter of 2009 primarily reflecting the proceeds from our issuance of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2009,





partially offset by:






·  


lower dividend payments in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009.





on june 23, 2005, we announced that the board of directors authorized a $5 billion share-purchase plan (the “2005 stock purchase plan”). on june 26, 2006, we announced that the board of directors increased the authorized amount of shares to be purchased under the 2005 stock purchase plan from $5 billion to $18 billion. on january 23, 2008, we announced that the board of directors authorized a new $5 billion share-purchase plan, to be funded by operating cash flows that may be utilized from time to time. in total, under the 2005 stock purchase plan, through april 4, 2010, we purchased approximately 710 million shares for approximately $18.0 billion. we did not purchase any shares of our common stock in the first quarter of 2010 or the first quarter of 2009. on may 4, 2010, we announced that we will purchase shares of our common
 stock as market conditions warrant.


off-balance sheet arrangements


in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of april 4, 2010, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnification
s are not significant.


certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.


dividends on common stock


in april 2010, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.18 per share, payable june 1, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on may 7, 2010.

new accounting standards


recently adopted accounting standards


see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 2. adoption of new accounting policies.


recently issued accounting standards, not adopted as of april 4, 2010


in october 2009, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an accounting standard update that addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable companies to account for certain products or services separately rather than as a combined unit.  this update addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting through the use of a selling price hierarchy to determine the selling price of a deliverable.  the provisions of the new standard will be adopted january 1, 2011, and we are in the process of evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements.

at average april 2010 exchange rates, we forecast 2010 revenues of $67.0 billion to $69.0 billion, reported diluted earnings per common share (eps) of $0.95 to $1.10 and adjusted diluted eps of $2.10 to $2.20. for an understanding of adjusted income, see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.

our 2012 financial targets are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties—as described in the “u.s. healthcare legislation”, “our operating environment” and “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” sections of this md&a; the “our operating environment, strategy and responses to key opportunities and challenges” section of our 2009 financial report, which is filed as exhibit 13 to our 2009 annual report on form 10-k; and part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2009 annual report on form 10-k.


forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results
 
the sec encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. this report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any disc
ussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans and prospects. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results, including, in particular, the financial guidance and targets and anticipated cost reductions set forth in the “our financial guidance for 2010,” “our financial targets for 2012” and “costs and expenses––cost-reduction initiatives and acquisition-related costs” sections of this md&a.


among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results are the following:






·  


success of research and development activities;









·  


decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve our drug applications, as well as their decisions regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of our products;









·  


speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;









·  


success of external business-development activities;









·  


competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line products and product candidates;









·  


ability to meet generic and branded competition after the loss of patent protection for our products and competitor products;









·  


ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally;









·  


difficulties or delays in manufacturing;









·  


trade buying patterns;









·  


impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product exclusivity;









·  


trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment;









·  


impact of u.s. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010­­––the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act;







  


46





  

 





·  


u.s. legislation or regulatory action affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access, including under medicaid, medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs; the importation of prescription drugs from outside the u.s. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries; direct-to-consumer advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals; and the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines;









·  


legislation or regulatory action in markets outside the u.s. affecting pharmaceutical product pricing, reimbursement or access;









·  


contingencies related to actual or alleged environmental contamination;









·  


claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates;









·

we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.
 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports and our other filings with the sec.


our 2009 annual report on form 10-k listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected and historic results. we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that form 10-k in this filing and investors should refer to it. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.
 
this report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body of data. in addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.

legal proceedings and contingencies


we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product liability, consumer, commercial, securities, environmental and tax litigations and claims; government investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. we do not believe any of them will have a material adverse effect on our financial position.


we record accruals for income tax contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a tax position is not sustainable under a “more likely than not” standard and we record our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction when we conclude that the potential recovery is more likely than not. we record accruals for all other contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related damages are estimable, and we record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when assured of recovery. if a range of liability is probable and estimable and some amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. if a range of liability is p
robable and estimable and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue the minimum of such probable range. many claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, label warnings, scientific evidence, actual damages and other matters. often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for these contingencies. these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future inc
ur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.


patent claims include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various products or processes. although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future results of operations.
