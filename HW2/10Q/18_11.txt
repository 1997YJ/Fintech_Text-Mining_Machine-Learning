item 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsour management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. md&a is organized as follows:•overview. discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of md&a.•results of operations. analysis of our financial results comparing the three months ended march 28, 2015 to the three months ended march 29, 2014.•liquidity and capital resources. analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity.•fair value of financial instruments. discussion of the methodologies used in the valuation of our financial instruments.this interim md&a should be read in conjunction with the md&a in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 27, 2014. the various sections of this md&a contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "goals," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "may," "will," "should," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are

$12.8 billion was flat compared to q1 2014 and down 13% from q4 2014. this was in line with our business outlook which was revised downward in march 2015 from our original expectations as a result of weaker than expected demand for business desktop pcs and challenging macroeconomic conditions, including an appreciating u.s. dollar. while the pc market was challenging in q1 2015, we continue to see strength in our data center group (dcg), internet of things group (iotg), and non-volatile memory solutions group. q1 2015 gross margin of 60.5%, was slightly above our original business outlook provided in january 2015. spending on research and development (r&d) and marketing, general and administrative (mg&a) was $4.9 billion, down approximately $100 million from q4 2014, and in line with our original business outlook. operating income of $2.6 billion was up 4% compared to q1 2014. earnings per share of $0.41 was up over 8% from q1 2014. we are using our manufacturing leadership to transform the company by developing products across a broad range of end markets. this is driving growth in revenue and operating income in our dcg, iotg and our non-volatile memory solutions group. to illustrate this transformation, in q1 2015, almost 40% of our revenue came from the combination of these businesses and these businesses accounted for more than two-thirds of the company’s overall operating income in q1 2015.32intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)in q1 2015, our silicon technology leadership remained a valuable competitive advantage as evident by our latest 14-nanometer (nm) processors: the 5th generation intel® core™ and intel® core™ m processors, which are ramping just ahead of our expectations. our client computing group (ccg) reached some important product milestones. we launched our newest intel® core™ vpro™ processor family for the notebook market segment, which featured aspects of our "no wires" vision. we also expanded our mobile product portfolio to address a range of price points and form factors including the intel® atom™ x5 and x7 processors for mainstream and premium tablet platforms, formerly code-named "cherry trail". additionally, we started shipping the intel® atom™ x3 processor, formerly code-named "sofia", intel's first integrated communications platform. we also introduced our first intel® xeon® soc processor, optimized for microservers, storage, network, and iot devices. this product is an example of our strategy to reuse intellectual property from our core business in complementary, profitable segments.our business continues to generate significant cash with $4.4 billion of cash from operations in q1 2015. during q1 2015, we purchased $2.0 billion in capital assets and returned cash to shareholders by both paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $750 million of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. we ended q1 2015 with $14.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets; down $4.9 billion from q1 2014. additionally, the board of directors declared a cash dividend in march 2015 of $0.24 per share of common stock to be paid in june 2015.for q2 2015, we are forecasting a revenue midpoint of $13.2 billion, up 3% from q1 2015. this forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for q2 2015. we are forecasting q2 2015 gross margin midpoint of 62%, up 1.5 points from q1 2015. for the full-year 2015 we expect revenue to be approximately flat to 2014, down from the original business outlook of mid-single digit percentage growth. we are now projecting a mid-single digit decline in the overall pc market, however we continue to forecast robust growth rates in our dcg, iotg and our non-volatile memory solutions group which we expect to offset the decline in ccg. due to lower than expected demand and reduced growth rates this year, we are lowering capital spending and spending on r&d and mg&a. we are now expecting higher reuse of 22nm capital for 14nm production and to align overall capacity with lowered demand. as a result, we are now forecasting the midpoint of capital spending at $8.7 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior business outlook.our business outlook for q2 2015 and full-year 2015 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (r&d plus mg&a), and capital expenditures. we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release. our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10-q. the statements in the business outlook and forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and at other times. the forward-looking statements in the business outlook and reiterated or updated in this form 10-q will be effective through the close of business on june 12, 2015 unless updated earlier or except as specifically noted otherwise in the business outlook. from the close of business on june 12, 2015 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for july 15, 2015, we will observe a “quiet period.”during the quiet period, the business outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k filed on april 14, 2015, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the sec, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10-q, should be considered historical, speaking prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.33intel corporationmanagement's discussion and

to reflect platforms sold through the client computing group, the data center group, and the internet of things group (total platform).our net revenue for q1 2015 increased by $17 million compared to q1 2014. total platform unit sales increased by 7%, primarily driven by the ramp of our phone and tablet platforms partially offset by a lower demand in the traditional pc business segment. to a lesser extent, higher non-volatile memory solutions group revenue also contributed to the increase in revenue. these increases were partially offset by lower total platform average selling prices of 6% primarily driven by a higher proportion of phone and tablet platform unit sales partially offset by higher dcg platform average selling prices.our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2015 increased by $117 million, or 2%, compared to q1 2014. this increase was due to approximately $275 million lower factory start-up costs, primarily driven by our next-generation 14nm process technology. the increase was partially offset by lower total platform revenue.our overall gross margin percentage increased to 60.5% in q1 2015 from 59.6% in q1 2014. the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin increase in dcg. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in q1 2015 and q1 2014 from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments.client

revenue for the ccg operating segment decreased by $677 million, or 8%, in q1 2015 compared to q1 2014. ccg platform average selling prices were down 13% and ccg platform unit sales were up 6%. the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower average selling prices as a result of a mix shift from lower desktop platform unit sales of 16% and a significant increase in our phone and tablet platform unit sales. to a lesser extent, lower notebook platform average selling prices of 3% also contributed to the decrease. the decrease was partially offset by higher notebook platform unit sales of 3% and higher desktop platform average selling prices of 2%.34intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)operating income decreased by $437 million, or 24%, in q1 2015 compared to q1 2014, which was driven by $499 million of lower gross margin partially offset by $62 million of lower operating expenses. the decrease in gross margin was driven by lower ccg platform revenue and was partially offset by approximately $260 million of lower factory start-up costs primarily driven by our next-generation 14nm process

respectively. our server platform revenue continued to benefit from growth in the internet cloud computing and high-performance computing market segments with continued strengthening of the enterprise market segment.operating income increased by $365 million, or 27%, in q1 2015 compared to q1 2014 with $568 million of higher gross margin partially offset by $203 million of higher operating

non-recurring q1 2014 litigation charge and lower q1 2015 marketing spending, partially offset by a q1 2015 donation to the intel foundation.restructuring and asset impairment charges. beginning in q3 2013, management approved several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. these actions include the wind down of our 200 millimeter wafer fabrication facility in massachusetts, which ceased production in q1 2015, and the closure of our assembly and test facility in costa rica, which ceased production in q4 2014. these targeted reductions will enable us to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the current business environment. we expect these actions to be substantially complete by the end of 2015.restructuring and asset impairment charges for each period were as follows:  three months ended(in millions) mar 28, 2015 mar 29, 2014employee severance and benefit

sheets. restructuring actions that were approved in 2015 impacted approximately 1,400 employees. since q3 2013, we have incurred a total of $640 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges. these charges included a total of $565 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 9,000 employees, and $75 million in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges.36intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $700 million, which will be realized within r&d, cost of sales, and mg&a. we began to realize these savings in q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in q3 2015.gains (losses) on equity investments and interest and othergains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for each period were as

corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)operating activitiescash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.for q1 2015 compared to q1 2014, the $914 million increase in cash provided by operations was due to changes in working capital and higher net income. changes in assets and liabilities as of march 28, 2015, compared to december 27, 2014, included a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales in q1 2015 and a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits due to the payout of 2014 profit-dependent compensation. for q1 2015, our three largest customers accounted for 42% of net revenue (42% for q1 2014) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 17% of our net revenue (15% for q1 2014), dell inc. accounting for 14% of our net revenue (15% for q1 2014), and lenovo group limited accounting for 11% of our net revenue (12% for q1 2014). these three customers accounted for 36% of net accounts receivable as of march 28, 2015 (43% as of december 27, 2014).investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.cash used for investing activities was lower for q1 2015 compared to q1 2014. cash used for investing activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets, an increase in maturities and sales of trading assets, and lower additions to property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a decrease in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments.financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.the increase in cash used for financing activities for q1 2015 compared to q1 2014 was primarily due to an increase in short-term debt repayments and an increase in repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program.liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of march 28, 2015, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $14.1 billion ($14.1 billion as of december 27, 2014). in addition to the $14.1 billion, we have $1.7 billion of other long-term investments, $1.3 billion of loans receivable and other, and $450 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months, that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. a substantial majority of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, which was fully available for use as of march 28, 2015. this ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $900 million during q1 2015. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of march 28, 2015. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.38intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)as of march 28, 2015, $10.7 billion of our $14.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $10.7 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $825 million was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of march 28, 2015. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 3: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of march 28, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $14.7 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $5.5 billion was classified as level 1, $9.2 billion as level 2, and $89 million as level 3.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $9.2 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 50% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 50% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of march 28, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $648 million of loans receivable and $238 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of march 28, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.5 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.39
