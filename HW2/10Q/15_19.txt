overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook


our business


our mission is to apply science and our global resources to improve health and well-being at every stage of life. we strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacturing of medicines for people and animals. our diversified global healthcare portfolio includes human and animal biologic and small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as nutritional products and many of the world’s best-known consumer products. every day, we work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. we also collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. our revenues are derived from the sale of our products, as well as through alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies.


we anticipate filing a registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) by mid-august for a potential initial public offering (ipo) of up to a 20% ownership stake in our animal health business, zoetis, inc. (zoetis). if the ipo is successfully completed, which we are targeting for the first half of 2013, we will have a variety of options to achieve a potential full separation of zoetis. as we continue to work toward a potential ipo and a potential full separation of zoetis, we remain open to all alternatives to maximize the after-tax return for our shareholders. the animal health business continues to be presented as a continuing operation in the condensed consolidated financial statements.


on april 23, 2012, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell our nutrition business to nestlé for $11.85 billion in cash. the transaction is expected to close by the first half of 2013, assuming the receipt of the required regulatory clearances and satisfaction of other closing conditions. beginning in the second quarter of 2012, we report the operating results of the nutrition business as discontinued operations––net of tax in the condensed consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. the transaction also includes the sale of certain prenatal multivitamins currently commercialized by the pfizer consumer healthcare business unit. the operating results of this product line are also included in discontinued operations––net of tax for all periods presented. in addition, the assets and liabilities associated with this business are classified as assets of discontinued operations and other assets held for sale and liabilities of discontinued operations, as appropriate, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.


on august 1, 2011, we completed the sale of our capsugel business for approximately $2.4 billion in cash. the operating results associated with this business are reported as discontinued operations––net of tax in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended july 3, 2011.


on january 31, 2011, we completed a tender offer for the outstanding shares of common stock of king pharmaceuticals, inc. (king) and acquired approximately 92.5% of the outstanding shares for approximately $3.3 billion in cash. on february 28, 2011, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of king for approximately $300 million in cash. commencing from january 31, 2011, our financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of king. as a result, in accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended july 3, 2011 reflect approximately five months of king’s u.s. operations and approximately four months of king’s international operations.


our 2012 performance


revenues in the second quarter of 2012 were $15.1 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the same period in 2011, due to an operational decline of $1.0 billion, or 6%, primarily as the result of the impact of the loss of exclusivity of lipitor in most major markets, including the u.s. on november 30, 2011, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $451 million, or 3%.


revenues in the first six months of 2012 were $29.9 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to the same period in 2011, due to an operational decline of $2.0 billion, or 6%, primarily as the result of the aforementioned loss of exclusivity of lipitor, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $515 million, or 2%.

our operating environment


u.s. healthcare legislation


in march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act (together, the u.s. healthcare legislation), was enacted in the u.s. as explained more fully in our 2011 annual report on form 10-k, this legislation has resulted in both current and longer-term impacts on us. our 2012 financial guidance (see the “our financial guidance for 2012” section of this md&a for additional information) reflects the expected full-year impact of the u.s. healthcare legislation.
 
in each of 2012 and 2011, we recorded the following amounts as a result of the u.s. healthcare legislation:






  


●


approximately $110 million and $158 million in the second quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, and approximately $234 million and $324 million in the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively, recorded as a reduction to revenues, related to the extended and expanded rebate provisions and the medicare “coverage gap” discount provision; and









  


●


approximately $78 million and $69 million in the second quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, and approximately $181 million and $139 million in the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to the annual fee payable to the federal government (which is payable annually through 2018 and is not deductible for u.s. income tax purposes) based on our prior-calendar-year share relative to other companies of branded prescription drug sales to specified government programs.





in june 2012, the u.s. supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the requirement in the u.s. healthcare legislation for americans to have insurance (called the individual mandate). separately, it is possible that congress may withhold all or a portion of the funding necessary to implement the u.s. healthcare legislation or may attempt to amend or repeal it. given the extent of the possible changes and the uncertainties concerning the interpretation, implementation and timing of any such changes, the u.s. healthcare legislation and any amendments thereto or repeal of all or portions thereof could impact our business and results of operations in the near term and over the next several years.

the fiscal year 2013 budget proposal submitted to congress by president obama in february 2012 includes a provision that would reduce the base exclusivity period for a biologics product from 12 years to seven years. there was no corresponding pending bill designed to amend the u.s. healthcare legislation to alter the biologics provisions. in may 2012, the budget proposal was voted down in both the u.s. house of representatives and the u.s. senate.


industry-specific challenges


the majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. as explained more fully in our 2011 annual report on form 10-k, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we face a number of industry-specific challenges, which can significantly impact our results. these factors include, among others: the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights, pipeline productivity and the regulatory environment, pricing and access pressures and competition among branded products.


as more fully explained in our 2011 annual report on form 10-k, the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. our 2012 financial guidance reflects the anticipated impact in 2012 of the loss of such rights as described below (see the “our financial guidance for 2012” section of this md&a for additional information).


our 2012 results have been and/or will be adversely impacted by the following:






  


●


lipitor in the u.s.––lipitor lost exclusivity in the u.s. in november 2011. the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s. began in may 2012, with attendant increased competitive pressures. beginning in 2012, sales of lipitor in the u.s. are reported in our established products business unit.





lipitor in international markets––lipitor lost exclusivity in japan in june 2011 (with generic competition occurring in november 2011), australia in april 2012 and the majority of european markets in march 2012 and may 2012.






  


●


other recent loss of exclusivity impacts––in the u.s., we lost exclusivity for vfend tablets in february 2011, for xalatan in march 2011 and for geodon in march 2012. the basic u.s. patent (including the six-month pediatric exclusivity period) for protonix expired in january 2011. the basic patent for vfend tablets in brazil expired in january 2011. we lost exclusivity for aromasin in the u.s. in april 2011, in the majority of european markets in july 2011 and in japan in november 2011. we lost exclusivity for xalatan and xalacom in the majority of european markets in january 2012. we lost exclusivity for aricept in the majority of european markets in february 2012 and april 2012. caduet lost exclusivity in the u.s. in november 2011 and in the majority of european markets in march and may 2012.









  


●


revatio tablet will lose exclusivity in the u.s. in september 2012, which reflects the extension of the exclusivity period from march to september 2012 as the result of a pediatric extension.









  


●


detrol ir will lose exclusivity in the u.s. in september 2012.









  


●


aricept––our rights to aricept in japan will return to eisai co., ltd. in december 2012.









  


●


spiriva–– our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim (bi) for spiriva will expire on a country-by-country basis between 2012 and 2016, including the expiration in certain eu markets in 2012.





for additional information, including with regard to the expiration of the patents and of co-promotion and licensing rights for various products in the u.s., eu and japan in 2012 and subsequent years, see the “patents and intellectual property rights” section of our 2011 annual report on form 10-k and the “the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights” section of our 2011 financial report, which is filed as exhibit 13 to our 2011 annual report on form 10-k.


we will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasing incidents of infringement whenever we deem appropriate. for more detailed information about our significant products, see the discussion in the “revenues––selected revenues from biopharmaceutical products” section of this md&a. see part ii––other information; item 1. legal proceedings, of this form 10-q for a discussion of certain recent developments with respect to patent litigation.

in august 2011, the federal budget control act of 2011 (the act) was enacted in the u.s. the act includes provisions to raise the u.s. treasury department’s borrowing limit, known as the debt ceiling, and provisions to reduce the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion between 2012 and 2021. deficit-reduction targets include $900 billion of discretionary spending reductions associated with the department of health and human services and various agencies charged with national security, but those discretionary spending reductions do not include programs such as medicare and medicaid or direct changes to pharmaceutical pricing, rebates or discounts. the office of management and budget (omb) is responsible for identifying the remaining $1.5 trillion of deficit reductions, which will be divided evenly between defense and non-defense spending. under this omb review process, social security, medicaid, veteran benefits and certain other spending categories are excluded from consideration, but reductions in payments to medicare providers may be made, although any such reductions are prohibited by law from exceeding 2%. additionally, certain payments to medicare part d plans, such as low-income subsidy payments, are exempt from reduction. while we do not know the specific nature of the spending reductions under the act that will affect medicare, we do not expect that those reductions will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. however, any significant spending reductions affecting medicare, medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant additional taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit-reduction effort could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.


the global economic environment
 
in addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses, continue to face the effects of the challenging economic environment, which have impacted our biopharmaceutical operations in the u.s. and europe, including the countries that use the euro currency (eurozone), affecting the performance of products such as lipitor, celebrex and lyrica, and in a number of emerging markets. we believe that patients, experiencing the effects of the challenging economic environment, including high unemployment levels, and increases in co-pays, sometimes are switching to generics, delaying treatments, skipping doses or using less effective treatments to reduce their costs. challenging economic conditions in the u.s. also have increased the number of patients in the medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many states, to formulary restrictions limiting access to brand-name drugs, including ours. in addition, we continue to experience pricing pressure as a result of the economic environment in europe and in a number of emerging markets, with government-mandated reductions in prices for certain biopharmaceutical products in certain european and emerging market countries.
 
significant portions of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same-currency revenues in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. depending on market conditions, foreign exchange risk also is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen, the u.k. pound, the china renminbi, and the canadian dollar and approximately 100 other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenues and expenses. if the u.s. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will increase, having a positive impact, and our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact, on net income. likewise, if the u.s. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact, and our overall expenses will decrease, having a positive impact on net income. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.
 
despite the challenging financial markets, pfizer maintains a strong financial position. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities. for further discussion of our financial condition, see the "financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” section of this md&a.


these and other industry-wide factors that may affect our businesses should be considered along with information presented in the “forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results” section of this md&a; in part ii, item 1a., “risk factors”, of this form 10-q; and in part i, item 1a, “risk factors,” of our 2011 annual report on form 10-k.


our strategy


we believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. we continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our products and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. we will work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize access to patients and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues.

on april 23, 2012, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell our nutrition business to nestlé. in addition, we anticipate filing a registration statement with the sec by mid-august for a potential initial public offering (ipo) of up to a 20% ownership stake in our animal health business, zoetis. if the ipo is successfully completed, which we are targeting for the first half of 2013, we will have a variety of options to achieve a potential full separation of zoetis. as we continue to work toward a potential ipo and a potential full separation of zoetis, we remain open to all alternatives to maximize the after-tax return for our shareholders. if nutrition and animal health are fully separated from the company, then, following these separations, pfizer will be a global biopharmaceutical company with an innovative core and a value core, with different cost structures and operating drivers, and a complementary consumer healthcare business with several well-known brands. the innovative core includes a portfolio of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line products and an r&d organization focused on continuing to build a robust pipeline of highly differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical needs. the value core includes a portfolio of products that have lost exclusivity or are approaching the loss of exclusivity that help meet the global need for less expensive, quality medicines.


in response to the challenging operating environment, we have taken and continue to take many steps to strengthen our company and better position ourselves for the future. we believe in a comprehensive approach to our challenges––organizing our business to maximize research, development and commercial opportunities, improving the performance of our innovative core and our value core, making the right capital allocation decisions, and protecting our intellectual property.


we continue to closely evaluate our global research and development function and pursue strategies to improve innovation and overall productivity by prioritizing areas with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, utilizing appropriate risk/return profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time. to that end, our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small and large molecules––immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines. in addition to reducing the number of disease areas of focus and the number of r&d programs, we are realigning and reducing our research and development footprint, and outsourcing certain functions that do not drive competitive advantage for pfizer. as a result of these actions, we expect significant reductions in our annual research and development expenses, which are reflected in our 2012 financial guidance, and we expect to incur significant costs in order to achieve these reductions, which are also reflected in our 2012 financial guidance. for additional information, see the “our financial guidance for 2012” and “costs and expenses—restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” sections of this md&a.


while a significant portion of r&d is done internally, we continue to seek to expand our pipeline by entering into agreements with other companies to develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. collaboration, alliance and license agreements and acquisitions allow us to capitalize on these compounds to expand our pipeline of potential future products. in addition, collaborations and alliances allow us to share risk and to access external scientific and technological expertise.


for information about our pending new drug applications (nda) and supplemental filings, see the “revenues—product developments-biopharmaceutical” section of this md&a.


we continue to build on our portfolio of businesses through various business development transactions. see the “our business development initiatives” section of this md&a for information on our recent transactions and strategic investments that we believe complement our businesses.


we continue to aggressively defend our patent rights against increasingly aggressive infringement whenever appropriate (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies), and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access. in addition, we will continue to employ innovative approaches to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from entering the supply chain and to achieve greater control over the distribution of our products, and we will continue to participate in the generics market for our products, whenever appropriate, once they lose exclusivity.


we remain focused on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the company. for information regarding our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, see the “costs and expenses—restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a.


our strategy also includes directly enhancing shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases. see the “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources—share purchase plans and dividends on common stock” sections of this md&a for more information.

our business development initiatives


we are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, dispositions and acquisitions. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate profitable revenue growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. we are especially interested in opportunities in our high-priority therapeutic areas––immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines––and in emerging markets and established products. we assess our businesses and assets as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities for our businesses.


the most significant recent transactions and events are described below.

biopharmaceutical revenues

 

worldwide revenues from biopharmaceutical products were $13.1 billion for the second quarter and $26.2 billion for the first six months of 2012, reflecting decreases of 10% and 9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2011 primarily due to:






  


●


the decrease in operational revenues of approximately $1.1 billion in the second quarter and $2.2 billion in the first six months of 2012 due to the loss of exclusivity of various products in certain markets, including a decrease of $1.3 billion in the second quarter and $2.3 billion in the first six months of 2012 in operational revenues from branded lipitor; and



 




  


●



the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, which resulted in revenue decreases of approximately $390 million in the second quarter and approximately $430 million in the first six months of 2012;






partially offset by:






  


●


a lower reduction in revenues related to the u.s. healthcare legislation of $48 million in the second quarter and $90 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of lipitor; and









  


●


an increase in operational revenues for certain biopharmaceutical products, particularly lyrica, celebrex and enbrel and in revenues from emerging markets.





geographically,






  


●


in the u.s., revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 17% in both the second quarter of 2012 and in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily reflecting lower revenues from lipitor, xalatan, caduet, effexor, geodon, zosyn, aromasin and vfend, all due to loss of exclusivity and from bmp2 and detrol/detrol la. the impact of these adverse factors was partially offset by the strong performance of certain other biopharmaceutical products and the lower reduction in revenues related to u.s. healthcare legislation.









  


●


in our international markets, revenues from biopharmaceutical products decreased 6% in the second quarter of 2012 and 3% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 5% in the second quarter of 2012 and 2% in the first six months of 2012. operationally, revenues were down 1% in both periods mainly due to declines in lipitor, xalatan/xalacom, norvasc, aromasin and effexor, all due to loss of exclusivity in certain markets, and lower alliance revenues, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of aricept in many major european markets, as well as lower revenues for spiriva in certain european countries reflecting the final-year terms of our spiriva collaboration agreements relating to those countries. the impact of these adverse factors was partially offset by the strong operational growth of lyrica, enbrel and the prevenar franchise.





during the second quarter and first six months of 2012, international revenues from biopharmaceutical products represented 62% and 61% of total revenues from biopharmaceutical products, respectively, compared to 59% and 58% in the second quarter and first six months of 2011, respectively.


primary care operating segment




●


primary care unit revenues decreased 32% in the second quarter and 28% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, reflecting lower operational revenues of 31% and 27%, respectively, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of lipitor in the u.s. in november 2011 and the resulting shift in the reporting of u.s. lipitor revenues to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2012. u.s. branded lipitor revenues, reported by the established products business unit, decreased from $1.4 billion to $296 million, or 79%, in the second quarter of 2012, and decreased from $2.7 billion to $679 million, or 75%, in the first six months of 2012. collectively, the decline in worldwide revenues for lipitor and for certain other primary care unit products that lost exclusivity in various markets in 2012 and 2011, as well as the resulting shift in the reporting of certain product revenues to the established products unit, reduced primary care unit revenues by $2.0 billion, or 34%, in comparison with the second quarter of 2011, and reduced primary care unit revenues by $3.6 billion, or 32%, in comparison with the first six months of 2011. the impact of these declines was partially offset by the strong growth of lyrica, most notably in japan, in addition to the solid performance of celebrex.



 
specialty care and oncology operating segment




●


specialty care unit revenues decreased 5% in the second quarter and 7% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, due to lower operational revenues of 2% and 6%, respectively, as well as the adverse impact of foreign exchange. operational revenues were unfavorably impacted in both periods in developed europe, primarily because most patients eligible to receive the pediatric catch-up dose of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 have already been vaccinated. prevnar 13 u.s. revenues for the first six months of 2012 were also impacted by a lower birth cohort compared to the same period last year and because utilization in adults is minimal at this time. additionally, specialty care unit revenues were unfavorably impacted by the losses of exclusivity of vfend and xalatan in the u.s. in february and march 2011, respectively, and the resulting shift in the reporting of vfend and xalatan u.s. revenues to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2012, as well as the loss of exclusivity of xalatan in developed europe in january 2012 and geodon in the u.s. in march 2012. collectively, these developments relating to vfend, xalatan, and geodon and the impact of other specialty care unit products that lost exclusivity in various markets in 2011 reduced specialty care unit revenues by $265 million, or 7%, in comparison with the second quarter of 2011, and reduced specialty care unit revenues by $520 million, or 7%, in comparison with the first six months of 2011. operational revenues in both periods were favorably impacted by the growth of enbrel, as well as the prevenar franchise in japan and australia.









●


oncology unit revenues decreased 5% in the second quarter and 6% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, due to lower operational revenues of 2% and 4%, respectively, as well as the adverse impact of foreign exchange. operational revenues were unfavorably impacted in both periods by the loss of exclusivity of aromasin in the majority of european markets in the second half of 2011 and the resulting shift in the reporting of such revenues to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2012. this loss of exclusivity reduced oncology unit revenues by $68 million, or 20%, in comparison with the first quarter of 2011, and reduced oncology unit revenues by $128 million, or 20%, in comparison with the first six months of 2011. operational revenues in both periods were favorably impacted by the growth of sutent, as well as the launches of inlyta and xalkori in the u.s.




 


  


56





  


 

established products and emerging markets operating segment




●


established products unit revenues increased 16% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to higher operational revenues of 18% and a 2% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. established products unit revenues increased 17% in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to higher operational revenues of 18% and a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the increases in established products unit operational revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 were mainly due to the shift in the reporting of branded lipitor revenues in the u.s. from the primary care unit totaling $296 million and $679 million, respectively, to the established products unit beginning january 1, 2012, as well as recent launches of generic versions of certain pfizer branded primary care and specialty care products, and by contributions from the sales of the authorized generic version of lipitor in the u.s. by watson pharmaceuticals, inc.  operational revenues in both periods were unfavorably impacted by the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s. for donepezil (aricept) in may 2011 as well as the continuing decline of u.s. revenues of certain products that previously lost exclusivity.









●


emerging markets unit revenues increased 8%, in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, due to higher operational revenues of 14%, partially offset by a 6% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. emerging markets unit revenues increased 7%, in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, due to higher operational revenues of 12%, partially offset by a 5% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the increases in emerging markets unit operational revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 were due to volume growth, primarily in china and russia, as a result of more targeted promotional efforts for key products, including lipitor, norvasc and lyrica. revenues in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period also were favorably impacted by the timing of government purchases of prevenar 13 in turkey and enbrel in brazil and unfavorably impacted by the timing of government purchases of prevenar 13 and certain other products in mexico.





total revenues from established products in both the established products and emerging markets units were $3.8 billion, with $1.1 billion generated in emerging markets, in the second quarter of 2012, and were $7.5 billion, with $2.0 billion generated in emerging markets, in the first six months of 2012.


other product revenues


animal health and consumer healthcare operating segment




●


animal health unit revenues increased 3% in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflecting higher operational revenues of 7% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 4%. operational revenues from animal health products were favorably impacted in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to solid performances in both the global livestock and the companion animal portfolios.



 





 


animal health unit revenues increased 4% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflecting higher operational revenues of 7% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3%. operational revenues from animal health products were favorably impacted in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily by the full six-month impact of legacy king product revenues in the first six months of 2012 compared to the partial-period impact in the first six months of 2011, as well as solid performances in both the global livestock and the companion animal portfolios.





 





●


consumer healthcare unit revenues increased 8% in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflecting higher operational revenues of 11% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3%. consumer healthcare unit revenues increased 3% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflecting higher operational revenues of 5% and the adverse impact of foreign exchange of 2%.  the operational revenue increases were primarily due to the addition of products from the acquisition of ferrosan consumer health in december 2011 and alacer corp. in february 2012.

rebates and chargebacks


as is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross product sales are subject to a variety of deductions, that generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized and primarily represent rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, distributors and managed care organizations with respect to our pharmaceutical products. these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. historically, our adjustments to actual results have not been material to our overall business. on a quarterly basis, our adjustments to actual results generally have been less than 1% of biopharmaceutical product net sales and can result in either a net increase or a net decrease in income. product-specific rebate charges, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.

(a)


rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year are impacted by the mix of products sold.







(b)


performance-based contract rebates include contract rebates with managed care customers within the u.s, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance terms and claims under these contracts. performance-based contract rebates also include rebates to wholesalers/distributor based on achievement of contracted performance for specific products or sales milestones.







(c)


chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.




 

the total rebates and chargebacks for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 were lower compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily as a result of:






  


●


the impact of decreased medicare, medicaid and performance-based contract rebates contracted for lipitor and certain other products that have lost exclusivity;









  


●


changes in product mix; and









  


●


the impact on chargebacks of decreased sales for certain products that have lost exclusivity and decreased sales for certain generic products sold by our greenstone unit that are subject to chargebacks;





partially offset by, among other factors:






  


●


an increase in chargebacks for our branded products as a result of increasing competitive pressures.





our accruals for medicaid rebates, medicare rebates, performance-based contract rebates and chargebacks totaled $2.6 billion as of july 1, 2012, a decrease from $3.3 billion as of december 31, 2011, and primarily are all included in other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

lipitor, for the treatment of elevated ldl-cholesterol levels in the blood, recorded worldwide revenues of $1.2 billion, or a decrease of 53%, in the second quarter of 2012, and $2.6 billion, or a decrease of 47%, in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, due to:









  


o


the impact of loss of exclusivity in canada in may 2010, spain in july 2010, brazil in august 2010, mexico in december 2010, japan in june 2011 (with generic entry occurring in november 2011) and the u.s. (with generic entry occurring in november 2011 and multi-source generic entry occurring in may 2012);









  


o


the continuing impact of an intensely competitive lipid-lowering market with competition from generics and branded products worldwide; and



 





  


o


increased payer pressure worldwide, including the need for flexible rebate policies.



 

geographically,






  


o


in the u.s., branded lipitor revenues were $296 million, a decrease of 79% in the second quarter of 2012, and $679 million, a decrease of 75% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011; and









  


o


in our international markets, branded lipitor revenues were $924 million, a decrease of 22%, in the second quarter of 2012, and $1.9 billion, a decrease of 14%, in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of $30 million in the second quarter and $28 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011.





see the “our operating environment” section of this md&a for a discussion concerning losses of exclusivity for lipitor in various markets that have impacted our results in 2012.

lyrica is indicated for the management of post-herpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the management of fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury, and as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures in the u.s., and for neuropathic pain (peripheral and central), adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and general anxiety disorder in certain countries outside the u.s. lyrica recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 14% in the second quarter of 2012 and 15% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. there was strong operational performance in international markets in the second quarter of 2012, including japan, where lyrica was launched in 2010 as the first product approved for the peripheral neuropathic pain (nep) indication. internationally, lyrica revenues increased 18% in the second quarter of 2012 and 19% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, with the growth due to a focus on enhancing the neuropathic pain diagnosis and treatment rates, the successful re-launch of the general anxiety disorder indication in the eu and physician education regarding neuropathic pain in japan. foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on international revenues of $32 million in the second quarter and $37 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. in the u.s., revenues increased 8% in both the second quarter of 2012 and in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. notwithstanding these increases, u.s. revenues continue to be affected by increased competition from generic versions of competitive medicines, as well as managed care pricing and formulary pressures.









  


●


enbrel, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis affecting the spine, recorded an increase in worldwide revenues, excluding the u.s. and canada, of 8% in the second quarter of 2012 and 6% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, with the growth attributable to overall growth in the anti-tnf biologic market.  enbrel revenues from the u.s. and canada are included in alliance revenues.



 





  


 


under our co-promotion agreement with amgen inc. (amgen), we co-promote enbrel in the u.s. and canada and share in the profits from enbrel sales in those countries, which we include in alliance revenues. our co-promotion agreement with amgen will expire in october 2013, and, subject to the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to a royalty stream for 36 months thereafter, which we expect will be significantly less than our current share of enbrel profits from u.s. and canadian sales. following the end of the royalty period, we will not be entitled to any further revenues from enbrel sales in the u.s. and canada. our exclusive rights to enbrel outside the u.s. and canada will not be affected by the expiration of the co-promotion agreement with amgen.

prevnar 13/prevenar 13 is our 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for the prevention of various syndromes of pneumococcal disease in infants and young children and in adults 50 years of age and older. prevnar 13/prevenar 13 for use in infants and young children has been launched in the u.s. for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 13 serotypes in prevnar 13 and otitis media caused by the seven serotypes in prevnar, and in the eu and many other international markets for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease, otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by the vaccine serotypes. in 2011, we received approval of prevnar 13/prevenar 13 for use in adults 50 years of age and older in the u.s. for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the 13 serotypes in prevnar 13, and in the eu for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the vaccine serotypes. to date, prevenar 13 for use in adults 50 years of age and older has been approved in over 55 countries and has been launched in the u.s., 14 developed europe markets and 17 emerging market countries. worldwide revenues for prevnar 13/prevenar 13 increased 12% in the second quarter of 2012 and 2% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to increased penetration in the emerging markets. u.s revenues for prevnar 13 were essentially flat and developed europe prevenar 13 revenues were slightly lower than in the second quarter of 2011, since most patients eligible to receive the pediatric catch-up dose already have been vaccinated and utilization in adults is minimal at this time.



 





 


we currently are conducting the community-acquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults (capita) to fulfill requirements in connection with the fda’s approval of the prevnar 13 adult indication under its accelerated approval program. capita is an efficacy trial involving subjects 65 years of age and older that is designed to evaluate whether prevnar 13 is effective in preventing the first episode of community-acquired pneumonia caused by the serotypes contained in the vaccine. we estimate that this event-driven trial will be completed in 2013. at its regular meeting held on february 22, 2012, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) indicated that it will defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older until the results of capita, as well as data on the impact of pediatric use of prevnar 13 on the disease burden and serotype distribution among adults, are available. we expect that the rate of uptake for the use of prevnar 13 in adults 50 years of age and older will be impacted by acip’s decision to defer voting on a recommendation for the routine use of prevnar 13 in that population. at its regular meeting held on june 20, 2012, acip voted to recommend the use of prevnar 13 for adults 19 years of age and older with immunocompromising conditions such as hiv infections, cancer, advanced kidney disease and other immunocompromising conditions. this recommendation is based on the disproportionate burden of invasive pneumococcal disease in this patient population.

celebrex, indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis worldwide and for the management of acute pain in adults in the u.s., japan and certain markets in the eu, recorded increases in worldwide revenues of 6% in the second quarter of 2012 and 7% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. in the second quarter of 2012, strong operational performance in international markets was driven primarily by japan volume growth for the lower back pain indication. in the u.s., prescription volume continues to be challenged by increased competition from generic versions of competitive medicines and managed care formulary pressures. celebrex is supported by continued educational and promotional efforts highlighting its efficacy and safety profile for appropriate patients.









●


viagra remains the leading treatment for erectile dysfunction. viagra worldwide revenues decreased 2% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to branded and generic competitive pressure in developed europe and emerging markets. viagra worldwide revenues increased 2% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, as the increase in the u.s. more than offset the decrease in international markets due to operational factors and the adverse impact of foreign exchange.









●


norvasc, for treating hypertension, lost exclusivity in the u.s. and other major markets in 2007 and in canada in 2009. norvasc worldwide revenues decreased 7% in both the second quarter of 2012 and in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011.









●


zyvox is the world’s best-selling agent among those used to treat serious gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus-aureus. zyvox worldwide revenues increased 6% in the second quarter of 2012 and 4% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to growth in emerging markets.









●


sutent is for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors after disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib mesylate and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. sutent worldwide revenues increased 8% in both the second quarter of 2012 and in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, due to strong operational performance driven by increased market share in the u.s. and emerging markets, as well as approval of sutent to treat progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, a rare disease, in the u.s. in may 2011 and in the eu in december 2010. we continue to drive total revenue and prescription growth, supported by cost-effectiveness data and efficacy data in first-line mrcc––including two-year survival data, which represent the first time that overall survival of two years has been seen in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, as well as through increasing access and healthcare coverage. as of june 30, 2012, sutent was the most prescribed oral mrcc therapy in the u.s.









●


our premarin family of products remains the leading therapy to help women address moderate-to-severe menopausal symptoms. it recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 7% in the second quarter of 2012 and 9% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to favorable wholesaler inventory levels, a u.s. price increase in january 2012 and favorable rebates, partially offset by continued decline in market share.

xalabrands consists of xalatan, a prostaglandin, which is a branded agent used to reduce elevated eye pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and xalacom, a fixed combination prostaglandin (xalatan) and beta blocker (timolol) available outside the u.s. xalatan/xalacom worldwide revenues decreased 28% in the second quarter of 2012 and 36% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. lower revenues were due primarily to the loss of exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2011 and in the majority of european markets in january 2012.









●


genotropin, one of the world’s leading human growth hormones, is used in children for the treatment of short stature with growth hormone deficiency, prader-willi syndrome, turner syndrome, small for gestational age syndrome, idiopathic short stature (in the u.s. only) and chronic renal insufficiency (outside the u.s. only), as well as in adults with growth hormone deficiency. genotropin is supported by a broad platform of innovative injection-delivery devices and patient-support programs. genotropin worldwide revenues decreased 8% in the second quarter of 2012 and 7% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011.









●


detrol/detrol la, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, is one of the most prescribed branded medicines worldwide for overactive bladder. detrol la is an extended-release formulation taken once a day. detrol/detrol la worldwide revenues decreased 11% in the second quarter of 2012 and 12% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to increased competition from other branded medicines and a shift in promotional focus to our toviaz product in most major markets. detrol immediate release (detrol ir) will lose exclusivity in the u.s. in september 2012.









●


benefix and refacto af/xyntha are hemophilia products using state-of-the-art manufacturing that assist patients with a lifelong bleeding disorder. benefix is the only available recombinant factor ix product for the treatment of hemophilia b, while refacto af/xyntha are recombinant factor viii products for the treatment of hemophilia a. both products are indicated for the control and prevention of bleeding in patients with these disorders and in some countries also are indicated for prophylaxis in certain situations, such as surgery. benefix recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 10% in the second quarter of 2012 and 11% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to price increases and strong demand due to adherence programs in the u.s. refacto af/xyntha recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 12% in the second quarter of 2012 and 13% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, partly due to a favorable prior-period rebate adjustment and a price increase in the u.s.









●


vfend is a broad-spectrum agent for treating yeast and molds. vfend worldwide revenues decreased 7% in the second quarter of 2012 and 8% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. international revenues decreased 8% in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, due to supply constraints.  revenues in the u.s. in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, declined primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of vfend tablets and the launch of generic voriconazole (generic vfend) in february 2011.









●


chantix/champix is an aid to smoking-cessation treatment in adults 18 years of age and older. chantix/champix worldwide revenues decreased 9% in the second quarter of 2012 and 10% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to the impact of changes to the product’s label, negative media exposure across several key markets and macro-economic decline, which decreased patient willingness to pay out of pocket. we are continuing our educational and promotional efforts, which are focused on addressing the significant health consequences of smoking, highlighting the chantix/champix benefit-risk proposition, emphasizing the importance of the physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit smoking and identifying alternative treatment-funding models.









●


pristiq is approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the u.s. and in various other countries. pristiq has also been approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (vms) associated with menopause in thailand, mexico, the philippines and ecuador. pristiq recorded an increase in worldwide revenues of 7% in the second quarter of 2012 and 12% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily driven by a new, more focused targeted strategy and promotional activities in the u.s., and internationally by both launches in new markets and further penetration in existing markets.









●


revatio, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah), had an increase in worldwide revenues of 10% in both the second quarter of 2012 and in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, due in part to increased pah awareness driving earlier diagnosis in the u.s. and eu. in the u.s., revatio tablet will lose exclusivity in september 2012, and revatio iv injection will lose exclusivity in may 2013.









●


zosyn/tazocin, our broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic, faces generic global competition. u.s. exclusivity was lost in september 2009. zosyn/tazocin recorded a decrease in worldwide revenues of 13% in the second quarter of 2012 and 21% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011.









●


geodon/zeldox, an atypical antipsychotic, is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar manic or mixed episodes, and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. geodon worldwide revenues decreased 67% in the second quarter of 2012 and 46% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to loss of exclusivity in the u.s. in march 2012.

effexor, an antidepressant for treating adult patients with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder, recorded a decrease in worldwide revenues of 37% in both the second quarter of 2012 and in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011.









●


prevnar/prevenar (7-valent), our 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for preventing invasive, and, in certain international markets, non-invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children, recorded a decrease in worldwide revenues of 46% in the second quarter of 2012 and 28% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011. many markets have transitioned from the use of prevnar/prevenar (7-valent) to prevnar 13/prevenar 13, resulting in lower revenues for prevnar/prevenar (7-valent). we expect this trend to continue.









●


caduet is a single-pill therapy combining lipitor and norvasc for the prevention of cardiovascular events. caduet worldwide revenues decreased 59% in the second quarter of 2012 and 57% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to the loss of u.s. exclusivity in november 2011.

alliance revenues worldwide decreased 1% in the second quarter of 2012 and 3% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, mainly due to the loss of exclusivity for aricept 5mg and 10mg tablets in the u.s. in november 2010 and the entry of multi-source generic competition in the u.s. in may 2011, as well as the loss of exclusivity in many major european markets in february 2012, partially offset by the strong performance of spiriva and enbrel in the u.s. we expect that the aricept 23mg tablet will have exclusivity in the u.s. until july 2013. see the “industry-specific challenges” section of this md&a for a discussion regarding the expiration of various contract rights relating to spiriva and aricept in 2012. eliquis (apixaban) is being jointly developed and commercialized by pfizer and bristol-myers squibb (bms). the two companies share with respect to the approved indication in the eu and, if and when indications for eliquis are approved in various markets, will share on a global basis commercialization expenses and profit/losses equally.





see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies for a discussion of recent developments concerning patent and product litigation relating to certain of the products discussed above.


embeda—on february 23, 2011, we stopped distribution of our embeda product due to failed specification tolerance related to naltrexone degradation identified in post-manufacturing testing. on march 10, 2011, we initiated a voluntary recall to wholesale and retail customers of all embeda products. we have been actively pursuing several possible pathways to address the stability issues that would enable us to resume marketing this product. we met with the fda in may 2012 to discuss our proposal for reintroduction of embeda to the market. the required stability programs are underway, and we anticipate submission of a prior approval supplemental in the first half of 2013.


research and development


research and development operations


innovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable, particularly for human health products. as a result, and also because we are predominately a human health company, the vast majority of our r&d spending is associated with human health products, compounds and activities.

(a)


our operating segments, in addition to their sales and marketing responsibilities, are responsible for certain development activities. generally, these responsibilities relate to additional indications for in-line products and ipr&d projects that have achieved proof-of-concept. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights.







(b)


worldwide research and development is generally responsible for human health research projects until proof-of-concept is achieved, and then for transitioning those projects to the appropriate business unit for possible clinical and commercial development. r&d spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. this organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various r&d projects. worldwide research and development is also responsible for all human-health-related regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities. pfizer medical is responsible for external affairs relating to all therapeutic areas, providing pfizer-related medical information to healthcare providers, patients and other parties, and quality assurance and regulatory compliance activities, which include conducting clinical trial audits and readiness reviews. the decreases in both the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 result from cost savings associated with the r&d productivity initiative announced on february 1, 2011 (see the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a).







(c)


corporate and other includes unallocated costs, primarily facility costs, information technology, share-based compensation, and restructuring-related costs. the decrease in the second quarter of 2012 results primarily from lower additional depreciation associated with the r&d productivity initiative announced on february 1, 2011 (see the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” section of this md&a).




 

product developments—biopharmaceutical
 
we continue to invest in r&d to provide potential future sources of revenues through the development of new products, as well as through additional uses for in-line and alliance products. notwithstanding our efforts, there are no assurances as to when, or if, we will receive regulatory approval for additional indications for existing products or any of our other products in development.


we continue to closely evaluate our global research and development function and pursue strategies to improve innovation and overall productivity by prioritizing areas with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, utilizing appropriate risk/return profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time. to that end, our research primarily focuses on five high-priority areas that have a mix of small and large molecules––immunology and inflammation; oncology; cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine diseases; neuroscience and pain; and vaccines.


our development pipeline, which is updated quarterly, can be found at www.pfizer.com/pipeline. it includes an overview of our research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication, phase of development and, for late-stage programs, mechanism of action. the information currently in our development pipeline is accurate as of august 9, 2012.


the following series of tables provides information about significant regulatory actions by, and filings pending with, the fda and regulatory authorities in the eu and japan, as well as additional indications and new drug candidates in late-stage development.

* the dates set forth in this column are the dates on which the fda accepted our submissions.




(a)


in may 2012, the fda’s peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee voted that the tafamidis meglumine data provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. in june 2012, the fda issued a “complete response” letter with respect to the tafamidis nda. the fda is requesting the completion of a second efficacy study to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness and also is asking for additional information on the data within the current tafamidis nda. we plan to request a meeting as soon as possible with the fda in order to discuss the next steps regarding the tafamidis nda.







(b)


on may 9, 2012, the fda’s arthritis advisory committee voted 8 to 2 to recommend approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. the committee’s recommendation will be considered by the fda in its review of the nda for tofacitinib. on july 31, 2012, we announced that the fda recently requested additional analysis of the existing data in the tofacitinib nda and that we anticipate that the fda may require additional time beyond the august 21, 2012 prescription drug user fee act (pdufa) action date to review this information.







(c)


this indication for apixaban is being developed in collaboration with our alliance partner, bms. in june 2012, the fda issued a “complete response” letter for apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. the “complete response” letter requests additional information on data management and verification from the aristotle trial. we and bms are working closely with the fda to provide the requested information. the fda has not requested that the companies complete any new studies.







(d)


in april 2010, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the genotropin mark vii multidose disposable device submission. in august 2010, we submitted our response to address the requests and recommendations included in the fda letter. in april 2011, we received a second “complete response” letter from the fda, requesting additional information. we are working to address the fda’s requests for additional information.







(e)


in june 2010, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the celebrex chronic pain supplemental nda. the supplemental nda remains pending while we await the completion of ongoing studies to determine next steps.







(f)


in october 2009, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda with respect to the supplemental nda for geodon for the treatment of acute bipolar mania in children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years. in october 2010, we submitted our response. in april 2010, we received a “warning letter” from the fda with respect to the clinical trial in support of this supplemental nda. we developed corrective actions and procedures to address the issues raised in the “warning letter”. in april 2011, we received a second “complete response” letter from the fda in which the fda indicated that, in its view, the reliability of the data supporting the filing had not yet been demonstrated. we are continuing to discuss this matter with the fda.







(g)


in 2005, king entered into an agreement with pain therapeutics, inc. (pt) to develop and commercialize remoxy. in august 2008, the fda accepted the nda for remoxy that had been submitted by king and pt. in december 2008, the fda issued a “complete response” letter. in march 2009, king exercised its right under the agreement with pt to assume sole control and responsibility for the development of remoxy. in december 2010, king resubmitted the nda for remoxy with the fda. in june 2011, we and pt announced that a “complete response” letter was received from the fda with regard to the resubmission of the nda. we have been working to address the issues raised in the letter, which primarily relate to manufacturing. data are now becoming available and are under analysis with regard to the formulation composition and analytical methods. upon completion of these analyses, we will determine the timing and nature of our engagement with the fda.







(h)


boehringer ingelheim (bi), our alliance partner, holds the ndas for spiriva handihaler and spiriva respimat. in september 2008, bi received a “complete response” letter from the fda for the spiriva respimat submission. the fda is seeking additional data, and we are coordinating with bi, which is working with the fda to provide the additional information. a full response will be submitted to the fda upon the completion of planned and ongoing studies.







(i)


two “approvable” letters were received by wyeth in april and december 2007 from the fda for viviant (bazedoxifene), for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis, that set forth the additional requirements for approval. in may 2008, wyeth received an “approvable” letter from the fda for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. the fda is seeking additional data, and we have been systematically working through these requirements and seeking to address the fda’s concerns. a full response will be provided to the fda. in february 2008, the fda advised wyeth that it expects to convene an advisory committee to review the pending ndas for both the treatment and prevention indications after we submit our response to the “approvable” letters. in april 2009, wyeth received approval in the eu for conbriza (the eu trade name for viviant) for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture. viviant was also approved in japan in july 2010 for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and in korea in november 2011 for the treatment and prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis.



 

in january 2007, we filed a supplemental nda with the fda for the pediatric use of zmax for the treatment of bacterial infections, acute otitis media (aom) and sinusitis. in september 2007, we received an “approvable” letter from the fda for zmax that set forth requirements to obtain approval for the pediatric aom indication based on pharmacokinetic data. in january 2010, we filed a supplemental nda, which proposed the inclusion of the new indications for aom and acute bacterial sinusitis in pediatric patients. in may 2011, we received a “complete response” letter from the fda with respect to the supplemental nda. at this time, we do not plan to continue to pursue these pediatric indications.

*


for applications in the eu, the dates set forth in this column are the dates on which the european medicines agency (ema) validated our submissions.









(a)


this indication for eliquis (apixaban) is being developed in collaboration with bms.







(b)


the current application is for the treatment of newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia. we are in discussions with regulators to revise this indication.







(c)


in july 2012, the ema’s committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp) issued an opinion recommending that crizotinib be granted conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of adults with previously treated alk-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.







(d)


in may 2012, the chmp issued an opinion recommending the approval of axitinib for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine.







(e)


in june 2012, the chmp issued an opinion recommending against the approval of taliglucercase alfa for the treatment of gaucher disease. as part of its opinion, the chmp gave a positive risk-benefit assessment for taliglucerase alfa, concluding that the benefits of the medicine outweigh its risks in the treatment of type 1 gaucher disease. despite the positive risk-benefit assessment, the chmp did not recommend approval due to shire’s velaglucerase alfa, which received prior marketing authorization with orphan drug designation for the same condition and, as a result, has orphan market exclusivity in the eu for ten years from the time of its authorization in august 2010. we pursued a request for derogation from shire’s orphan market exclusivity based on a number of factors. that request, however, was denied. the chmp’s opinion will be reviewed by the european commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for the eu.

(a)


following requests by the fda in 2010, we suspended and subsequently terminated worldwide the osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy studies of tanezumab. the fda’s requests followed a small number of reports of osteoarthritis patients treated with tanezumab who experienced the worsening of osteoarthritis leading to total joint replacement and also reflected the fda’s concerns regarding the potential for such events in other patient populations. in december 2010, the fda placed a clinical hold on all other anti-nerve growth factor therapies under clinical investigation in the u.s. studies of tanezumab in cancer pain were allowed to continue. extensive analyses were undertaken of all total joint replacements reported in studies of tanezumab. the results of these analyses and the conclusions drawn were provided to the fda. on march 12, 2012, the fda’s arthritis advisory committee met to discuss the future development of nerve growth factor inhibitors, including tanezumab. the committee voted that there is a role for the ongoing development of nerve growth factor inhibitors in conditions such as osteoarthritis and for the management of pain associated with conditions other than osteoarthritis for which there are no agents with demonstrated analgesic effect. the committee’s recommendations are not binding on the fda, which will make the final determination on the partial clinical hold. discussions with fda are ongoing in an effort to resume clinical development of tanezumab.



 

our collaboration with janssen alzheimer immunotherapy research & development, llc (janssen ai), a subsidiary of johnson & johnson, with regard to bapineuzumab included four phase 3, double-blind studies of intravenous (iv) bapineuzumab in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease. janssen ai led the two, primarily north american, phase 3 studies (studies 301 and 302). we led the two, primarily ex-north america, phase 3 studies (studies 3000 and 3001). in july 2012, we reported that the two co-primary endpoints in study 302, change in cognitive and functional performance compared to placebo, were not met in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease who carry the apoe4 genotype. in august 2012, we reported that the two co-primary endpoints in study 301, change in cognitive and functional performance compared to placebo, were not met in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease who do not carry the apoe4 genotype. in august 2012, we announced that, based on the topline results of studies 302 and 301, we and janssen ai decided to discontinue all bapineuzumab iv studies in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease. this includes the pfizer-led studies 3000 and 3001, as well as all follow-on extension studies of bapineuzumab iv in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease.

cost of sales decreased 23% in the second quarter of 2012 and 22% in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same periods in 2011, primarily due to:






  


●


a decline in revenues related to products that lost exclusivity in various markets causing a shift in geographic and business mix;









  


●


lower purchase accounting charges, primarily reflecting the fair value adjustments to acquired inventory from wyeth that was subsequently sold;









  


●


lower costs related to our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, as well as the higher benefits generated from the ongoing productivity initiatives to streamline the manufacturing network; and









  


●


the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 8% for the second quarter of 2012 and 6% for the first six months of 2012.

we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring, integrating and restructuring businesses and in connection with our global cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. for example:






  


●


in connection with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, significant programs of which began in 2005, we typically incur costs and charges associated with site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems; and









  


●


in connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company).




 

all of our businesses and functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development, as well as groups such as information technology, shared services and corporate operations. since the acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009, our cost-reduction initiatives announced on january 26, 2009, but not completed as of december 31, 2009, were incorporated into a comprehensive plan to integrate wyeth’s operations to generate cost savings and to capture synergies across the combined company. in addition, on february 1, 2011, we announced a new research and productivity initiative to accelerate our strategies to improve innovation and productivity in r&d by prioritizing areas with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, utilizing appropriate risk/return profiles and focusing on areas with the highest potential to deliver value in the near term and over time.


cost-reduction goals


with respect to the january 26, 2009 announcements, and our acquisition of wyeth on october 15, 2009, in the aggregate, we achieved our cost-reduction goal by the end of 2011, a year earlier than expected, and are continuing to generate cost reductions.


with respect to the new r&d productivity initiative announced on february 1, 2011, we set a goal to achieve significant reductions in our annual research and development expenses by the end of 2012. adjusted r&d expenses were $8.4 billion in 2011, and were $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2012 and $3.4 billion in the first six months of 2012. we expect adjusted r&d expenses to be approximately $6.5 billion to $7.0 billion in 2012. (for an understanding of adjusted research and development expenses, see the “adjusted income” section of this md&a.) we are on track to meet this 2012 goal.


in addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our organizations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities.


expected total costs


we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in connection with these announced actions. we estimate that the total costs of both of the aforementioned initiatives could range up to $16.4 billion through 2012, of which we have incurred approximately $13.9 billion in cost-reduction and acquisition-related costs (excluding transaction costs) through july 1, 2012.

key activities


the targeted cost reductions have been and are being achieved through the following actions:






●


the closing of duplicative facilities and other site rationalization actions company-wide, including research and development facilities, manufacturing plants, sales offices and other corporate facilities. among the more significant actions are the following:









  


●


manufacturing: after the acquisition of wyeth, our manufacturing sites totaled 81. other acquisitions have added 21 manufacturing sites and we have subsequently exited nine. our plant network strategy will result in the exit of a further 10 sites over the next several years.







  


•







  


●


research and development: after the acquisition of wyeth, we operated in 20 r&d sites and announced that we would close a number of sites. we have completed a number of site closures, including our sandwich, u.k. research and development facility, except for a small presence. in addition, in 2011, we rationalized several other sites to reduce and optimize the overall r&d footprint. we disposed of our toxicology site in catania, italy; exited our r&d sites in aberdeen and gosport, u.k.; and disposed of a vacant site in st. louis, mo. we are presently marketing for sale, lease or sale/lease-back, either a portion of or all of certain of our r&d campuses. locations with r&d operations are in the u.s., europe, canada and china, with five major research sites in addition to a number of specialized units. we also re-prioritized our commitments to disease areas and have discontinued certain therapeutic areas and r&d programs.



 




●


workforce reductions across all areas of our business and other organizational changes, primarily in the u.s. field manufacturing, r&d and corporate functions. we identified areas for a reduction in workforce across all of our businesses. after the closing of the wyeth acquisition, the combined workforce was approximately 120,700. as of july 1, 2012, after giving effect to the impact of acquisitions subsequent to the wyeth acquisition, the workforce totaled approximately 101,000, a decrease of 2,700, primarily in the u.s. field force, manufacturing, r&d and corporate operations, from 103,700 as of december 31, 2011. we have exceeded our original target for reducing the combined pfizer/wyeth workforce.









●


the increased use of shared services.









●


procurement savings.

adjusted income


general description of adjusted income measure


adjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted income in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines for humans and animals, consumer healthcare (over-the-counter) products and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted income as net income attributable to pfizer inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. the adjusted income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap net income.

 


  


72





  


 

the adjusted income measure is an important internal measurement for pfizer. we measure the performance of the overall company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted income measure is utilized:






●


senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an adjusted income basis;









●


our annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted income basis; and









●


senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using this adjusted income measure. adjusted income is one of the performance metrics utilized in the determination of bonuses under the pfizer inc. executive annual incentive plan that is designed to limit the bonuses payable to the executive leadership team (elt) for purposes of internal revenue code section 162(m). subject to the section 162(m) limitation, the bonuses are funded from a pool based on the achievement of three financial metrics, including adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from adjusted income. since 2011, this metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool made available to elt members and other members of senior management and will constitute a factor in determining each of these individual’s bonus.





despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that adjusted income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted income (unlike u.s. gaap net income) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted income is presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.


we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. we also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, the earn-out of performance share award grants is determined based on a formula that measures our performance using relative total shareholder return.

 

purchase accounting adjustments


adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with pharmacia (acquired in 2003), wyeth (acquired in 2009) and king (acquired in 2011), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.


certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which research and development costs previously have been expensed.


however, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted income. this component of adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our research and development costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.


acquisition-related costs


adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. for additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.

 


  


73





  


 

we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.


the integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other global regulatory authorities.


discontinued operations


adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the sale of such operations such as the sale of our capsugel business, which we sold in august 2011, and the pending sale of our nutrition business. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. (restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation of the restated periods but are presented here on a restated basis for consistency across all periods.)


certain significant items


adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; charges related to certain sales or disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by u.s. gaap; amounts associated with transition service agreements in support of discontinued operations after sale; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 12. commitments and contingencies included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q. normal, ongoing defense costs of the company or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

the effective tax rate on non-gaap adjusted income was 28.9% in the second quarter of 2012, compared with 29.1% in the second quarter of 2011. for the first six months of 2012, the effective tax rate on non-gaap adjusted income was 29.0%, compared with 28.6% in the same period last year. the effective tax rates in both periods in 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 were favorably impacted by the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and unfavorably impacted by the expiration of the u.s. research and development tax credit.

analysis of the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income



changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 reflect the following:


for foreign currency translation adjustments, for the second quarter of 2012, the change  reflects the weakening of several foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro and the australian dollar, and the brazilian real, offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar; for the first six months of 2012, the change reflects the weakening of several foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, the japanese yen, the u.k. pound, and the brazilian real.
 
for benefit plans: actuarial gains/(losses), reflects the impact of remeasurements on the u.s., puerto rico and u.k. plans. see also notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 10. pension and other benefit plans.

 
analysis of the condensed consolidated balance sheets


many changes in our asset and liability accounts as of july 1, 2012, compared to december 31, 2011, reflect, among other things, increases associated with our acquisitions of alacer corp. and ferrosan holding a/s (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2a. acquisitions and divestitures: acquisitions).


for information about certain of our financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments, short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt, see “analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources” below.


for accounts receivable, net, see “selected measures of liquidity and capital resources: accounts receivable” below.
 

for inventories, the change also reflects an increase primarily related to the build of inventory in anticipation of plant rationalizations.
 

for identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, the change also includes the impact of impairments of certain assets (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 4. other deductions—net).


for accounts payable, the change also reflects lower spending as a result of our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives and the impact of lower revenues on expense levels.


for pension benefit obligations and postretirement benefit obligations, the change also reflects the impact of $552 million of company contributions and the impact of a decision to freeze the u.s. defined benefit plans as of january 1, 2018 see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 10. pension and postretirement benefit plans).

operating activities


our net cash provided by operating activities was $6.8 billion in the first six months of 2012, compared to $10.5 billion in the same period of 2011. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to:
 





  


●


the loss of exclusivity of lipitor, as well as certain other products resulting in lower revenues and associated expenses (see also the “industry-specific challenges” section of this md&a), partially offset by spending reductions resulting from our company-wide cost-reduction initiatives;




 






  


●



an increase in payments for taxes;





 







  


●



payments made in connection with certain legal matters;





 







  


●



the build of inventory in anticipation of plant rationalizations; and





 









  


●


the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.





the first six months of 2012 were also impacted by the loss of exclusivity of lipitor in most major markets, including in the united states. see also the “industry-specific challenges” section of this md&a.

 

in the first six months of 2012, the line item called other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, reflects changes in the ordinary course of business for accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued compensation and other current and non-current liabilities. for additional information about accounts receivable, see also “selected measures of liquidity and capital resources: accounts receivable” below.


investing activities


our net cash used in investing activities was $436 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $1.1 billion in the same period in 2011. the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to:






  


●


net proceeds from redemption and sales of investments of $950 million in the first six months of 2012, which were primarily used to finance our acquisitions, compared to net proceeds from redemptions and sales of investments of $4.8 billion in the first six months of 2011, which were primarily used to finance our acquisition of king,





largely offset by:






  


●


cash paid of $782 million, net of cash acquired, for our acquisitions of alacer corp. and ferrosan in the first six months of 2012 (see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2a. acquisitions and divestitures: acquisitions), compared to $3.2 billion cash paid, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of king in the first six months of 2011.





financing activities


our net cash used in financing activities was $6.5 billion in the first six months of 2012, compared to $10.3 billion in the same period in 2011. the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to:






  


●


net repayments of borrowings of $391 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to net repayments of borrowings of $3.5 billion in the first six months of 2011; and









  


●


lower purchases of common stock;





slightly offset by:






  


●


higher cash dividends paid.




 


  


78





  


 

analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources
 
we rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. we believe that we have the ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we further believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:






  


●


the working capital requirements of our operations, including our research and development activities;









  


●


investments in our business;









  


●


dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;









  


●


share repurchases, including our plan to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common stock in 2012;









  


●


the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;









  


●


paying down outstanding debt;









  


●


contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and









  


●


business-development activities.





our long-term debt is rated high quality by both standard & poor’s and moody’s investors service. see the “credit ratings” section below. as market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. we have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified, available-for-sale debt securities.

we funded our acquisition of ferrosan’s consumer healthcare business, which closed on december 1, 2011 (which fell in the first fiscal quarter of 2012 for our international operations), and our acquisition of alacer, which closed on february 26, 2012, with available cash and the proceeds from short-term investments. for additional information on our acquisitions of ferrosan and alacer, see notes to condensed consolidated financial statements—note 2a. acquisitions and divestitures: acquisitions.

domestic and international short-term funds
 
many of our operations are conducted outside the u.s., and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. we generally hold approximately 10%-30% of these short-term funds in u.s. tax jurisdictions. the amount of funds held in u.s. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s. federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be permanently reinvested outside of the u.s., no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided.


assuming the receipt of the required regulatory clearances, the satisfaction of other closing conditions and the completion of the sale of our nutrition business to nestlé, a substantial portion of the sale proceeds will be located outside the u.s. we are evaluating and will continue to evaluate potential domestic and international uses of those proceeds in the context of our overall capital requirements and capital-allocation strategies. (for additional information regarding our agreement to sell the nutrition business to nestlé, see the "our business development initiatives" section of this md&a.)


accounts receivable


we continue to monitor developments regarding government and government agency receivables in several european markets where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. historically, payments from a number of these european governments and government agencies extend beyond the contractual terms of sale and the year over year trend is worsening.


we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on an analysis of the following: (i) payments received to date; (ii) the consistency of payments from customers; (iii) direct and observed interactions with the governments (including court petitions) and with market participants (for example, the factoring industry); and (iv) various third-party assessments of repayment risk (for example, rating agency publications and the movement of rates for credit default swap instruments).


as of july 1, 2012, we had about $1.7 billion in aggregate gross accounts receivable from governments and/or government agencies in spain, italy, greece, portugal and ireland, where economic conditions remain challenging and uncertain. such receivables in excess of one year from the invoice date, totaling $619 million, were as follows: $355 million in spain; $153 million in italy; $79 million in greece; $29 million in portugal; and $3 million in ireland.


although certain european governments and government agencies sometimes delay payments beyond the contractual terms of sale, we seek to appropriately balance repayment risk with the desire to maintain good relationships with our customers and to ensure a humanitarian approach to local patient needs.


we will continue to closely monitor repayment risk and, when necessary, we will continue to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts.


our assessments about the recoverability of accounts receivables can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements––note 1c. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions included in our 2011 financial report, which is filed as exhibit 13 to our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2011.


credit ratings


two major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody’s investors service (moody’s) and standard & poor’s (s&p), assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

 

the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:

debt capacity


we have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. as of july 1, 2012, we had access to $9.1 billion of lines of credit, of which $2.0 billion expire within one year. of these lines of credit, $8.3 billion are unused, of which our lenders have committed to loan us $7.1 billion at our request. also, $7.0 billion of our unused lines of credit, all of which expire in 2016, may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings.


global economic conditions


the challenging economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that the challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future.


share purchase plans


on december 12, 2011, we announced that the board of directors authorized a new $10 billion share-purchase plan. in the first six months of 2012, we purchased approximately 137 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3.0 billion. we purchased approximately 183 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3.7 billion in the first six months of 2011.


after giving effect to share purchases through july 1, 2012, our remaining share-purchase authorization is approximately $7.0 billion as of july 1, 2012. during 2012, we anticipate purchasing approximately $5 billion of our common stock, with the remaining authorized amount available in 2013 and beyond.


off-balance sheet arrangements


in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications generally are subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of july 1, 2012, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.


certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.


dividends on common stock


in june 2012, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.22 per share, payable september 5, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on august 3, 2012.

the sec encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. this report and other written or oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future operating and financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic review, capital allocation, business-development plans, and share-repurchase and dividend-rate plans. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, business plans and prospects, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, share-repurchase and dividend-rate plans, government regulation and financial results, including, in particular, the financial guidance and anticipated costs and cost savings set forth in the “restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives” and “our financial guidance for 2012” sections of this md&a. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:

we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q, 8-k and 10-k reports and our other filings with the sec.


our 2011 annual report on form 10-k listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results. we note these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. readers can find them in part i, item 1a, of that filing under the heading “risk factors.” we incorporate that section of that form 10-k in this filing and investors should refer to it. reference is also made to part ii, item 1a, “risk factors,” of this form 10-q. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.
 
this report includes discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. these studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body of data. in addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.


legal proceedings and contingencies
 
information with respect to legal proceedings and contingencies required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to notes to condensed consolidated financial statements––note 12. commitments and contingencies in part i, item 1, of this form 10-q.
