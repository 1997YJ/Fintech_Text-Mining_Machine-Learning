of our associates, and our commitment to customer service remains strong. in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, we continued to invest in our digital platforms, including content, website improvements, and the mobile experience, to provide a frictionless interconnected experience online, while also remaining focused on improving the interconnected experience in the store. sales from

merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. we strive to be the leader in product authority, connecting products and services to the needs of our customers. in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, our merchants continued to collaborate with our suppliers to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation – we drive productivity and efficiency through continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain. further, our disciplined capital allocation builds shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. we plan to continue to innovate our business model and value chain to support our productivity cycle and enhance overall value for customers throughout the year.in february 2017, our board of directors increased our targeted dividend payout ratio to 55% of diluted earnings per share. also in february 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. under the program, we repurchased a total of 12.3 million shares of our common stock for $2.1 billion through an asr agreement and the open market during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, we repurchased 38.0 million shares of our common stock for $5.9 billion through asr agreements and the open market. we generated $9.7 billion of cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. this cash flow, along with $3.0 billion of long-term debt issued in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, was used to fund cash payments of $6.1 billion for share repurchases, pay $3.2 billion of dividends, fund $1.4 billion in capital expenditures, repay $585 million of short-term debt, and repay $500 million of floating rate senior notes that matured on september 15, 2017.our return on invested capital ("roic") was 32.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 29.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. we define roic as net operating profit after tax ("nopat"), a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. for a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure, and our calculation of roic, see "non-gaap financial measures" below.13table of contentswe believe the percentage relationship between net sales and the major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of these items as well as the

billion from $23.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, net sales increased 6.4% to $77.0 billion from $72.4 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. the increase in net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth. hurricane-related sales positively impacted total sales growth by approximately $282 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. we expect continued hurricane recovery-related sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. total comparable store sales increased 7.9% and 6.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively, which reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores. all of our departments except one posted positive comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales except for one, which was flat. comparable store sales for our lumber, appliances, electrical, indoor garden, tools, building materials and flooring product categories were above the company average for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. further, our comparable store average ticket increased 5.1% and 4.2% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances and flooring. our comparable store customer transactions increased 2.7% and 2.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. gross profit increased 7.5% to $8.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from $8.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, gross profit increased 6.1% to $26.3 billion from $24.8 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 34.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, gross profit margin was 34.1% compared to 34.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects pressure from product mix changes and higher supply chain expense driven by hurricane-related sales. gross profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 reflects the impact of product mix changes and higher shrink, partially offset by benefits from our supply chain. selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") increased 5.5% to $4.5 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from $4.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, sg&a increased 3.7% to $13.4 billion from $12.9 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. sg&a includes approximately $104 million of hurricane-related expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 18.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 18.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, sg&a as a percent of net sales was 17.4% compared to 17.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and continued expense control. depreciation and amortization increased 2.7% to $454 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from $442 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. depreciation and amortization was $1.3 billion for the first nine months of both fiscal 2017 and 2016. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 1.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.7% compared to 1.8% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.operating income increased 10.8% to $3.7 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 from $3.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, operating income increased 9.4% to $11.5 billion from $10.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. as a result of the hurricanes, operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $51 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017. operating income as a percent of net sales was 14.7% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 14.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, operating income as a percent of net sales was 14.9% compared to 14.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. interest and other, net, was $247 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $236 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, interest and other, net, was $737 million compared to $701 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for the third quarter and first nine months of both fiscal 2017 and 2016.our combined effective income tax rate was 36.3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to 36.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. the effective income tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 reflects a $92 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for share-based payment awards as a result of the adoption of asu no. 2016-09.15table of contentsdiluted earnings per share were $1.84 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, diluted earnings per share were $5.76 compared to $5.00 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. diluted earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017 included benefits of $0.01 and $0.08, respectively, as a result of the adoption of asu no. 2016-09.non-gaap financial measuresto provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.return on invested capitalwe believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. the following table provides our roic calculation and reconciles nopat to net earnings:   for the twelve months endeddollar amounts in millions october 29,

for the most recent twelve-month period.(3)roic is calculated as nopat divided by average debt and equity.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.7 billion compared to $7.9 billion for the same period of fiscal 2016. this increase primarily reflects a $677 million increase in operating cash flows from the effective management and procurement of merchandise inventories and a $638 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher sales and expense leverage. net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion for the same period of fiscal 2016. this change was primarily due to $260 million in payments for business acquired, net, related to the acquisition of compact power equipment, inc. and a $209 million increase in capital expenditures.net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $7.3 billion compared to $5.4 billion for the same period of fiscal 2016. this change was primarily due to $1.5 billion more in repurchases of common stock, $607 million more in cash dividends paid to stockholders and $235 million more in repayments of short-term debt, partially offset by $532 million more in net incremental long-term debt issued in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period of fiscal 2016.in september 2017, we issued the 2027 notes at a discount of $3 million. the net proceeds of the 2027 notes were used to repay our floating rate notes due september 15, 2017 and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.16table of contentsalso in september 2017, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $250 million, accounted for as a fair value hedge, to hedge against changes in the fair value of the 2027 notes attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate.in june 2017, we issued the 2020 floating rate notes; the 2020 notes at a discount of $1 million; and the 2047 notes at a discount of $5 million. the net proceeds of the june 2017 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into an asr agreement under which we paid $1.65 billion to a third party financial institution and received a total of 10.8 million shares. in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into an asr agreement under which we paid $1.2 billion to a third party financial institution and received an initial delivery of 6.7 million shares. the asr agreement terminated on november 17, 2017, at which time the company became contractually entitled to receive an additional 0.7 million shares upon settlement. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in december 2019 and contains various customary covenants. at october 29, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, all of our short-term borrowings were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $1.0 billion. as of october 29, 2017, there were $125 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. as of october 29, 2017, we had $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.recent accounting pronouncementsfor a summary
