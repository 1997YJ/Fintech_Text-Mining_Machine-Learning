item 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsour management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. md&a is organized as follows:•overview. discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of md&a.•results of operations. analysis of our financial results comparing the three months ended april 1, 2017 to the three months ended april 2, 2016.•liquidity and capital resources. analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity.•contractual obligations. material changes, outside our ordinary course of business, to our significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016.this interim md&a should be read in conjunction with the md&a in our annual report on form 10-k  for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2016 (2016 form 10-k). 26intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)overview(dollars in billions, except per share amounts)27intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)in q1 2017 we achieved revenue of $14.8 billion, up 8% from q1 2016. the increase in revenue was in-line with our expectation of $14.8 billion. compared to q1 2016, revenue increased by $1.1 billion, primarily driven by higher average selling prices across our personal computer (pc) and growth in our data center and internet of things  businesses. and our non-volatile memory solutions group (nsg) set record revenue of $866 million, up 55% from q1 2016. earnings per share were $0.61, up 19 cents on a year-on-year basis. this was driven by higher average selling prices of notebook and data center group (dcg) platforms, improved 14nm process technology costs, higher gross margin from programmable solutions group (psg) due to altera acquisition-related charges and adjustments in q1 2016, and higher gains on investments. the increase was partially offset by higher tax rate and lower platform volumes.•client computing group (ccg) had revenue of $8.0 billion, up 6% with platform volumes down 4% and platform average selling prices up 7% compared to q1 2016. the business remains strong and healthy with growing revenue and profit despite of the declining pc market.•data center group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% with platform volumes down 1% and platform average selling prices up 6% compared to q1 2016.•gross margin of 61.8% was up 2.5 points compared to q1 2016.•research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general, and administrative (mg&a) spending for the quarter was $5.4 billion, down 1% from a year ago. r&d and mg&a were 36.7% of revenue, down approximately 3 points from q1 2016. •operating income for q1 2017 was $3.6 billion, up 40% on a year-on-year basis. the tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%, up 3.9% compared to q1 2016. net income for q1 2017 was $3.0 billion, up 45% from q1 2016. •our business continues to generate healthy cash flow with $3.9 billion of cash from operations in q1 2017. during q1 2017, we purchased $2.0 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and used $1.2 billion to repurchase 35 million shares of stock.we are on-track for a mid-summer launch of our next generation intel® xeon® processor, code named skylake. the new product will deliver performance gains across a wide range of workload, for example, higher performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads. we shipped our first intel® optane™ solid state drives (ssd) for data center and intel® optane™ memory for personal computers. during q1 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mobileye n.v. (mobileye), a leading supplier for computer vision systems in the automotive industry. this acquisition will combine mobileye’s leading computer vision expertise with intel’s high-performance computing and connectivity expertise to create automated driving solutions from cloud to car.on april 3, 2017, subsequent to the first quarter of 2017, we completed the planned divestiture of certain assets and liabilities relating to isecg to establish mcafee, a newly formed, separate cybersecurity company jointly owned with tpg. as we focus on our core strategic areas, we plan to continue developing integrated and hardware-enabled security and collaborate with mcafee and other ecosystem partners to optimize and enhance their products for intel architecture. 28intel

was driven by higher platform average selling prices, up 8%, primarily from our notebook, dcg, and iotg platforms. additionally, revenue increased from higher nsg revenue and ccg non-platform revenue. the increase in revenue was offset by lower platform unit sales, down 4%, primarily on desktop platforms. our overall gross margin percentage was 61.8% in q1 2017, up from 59.3% in q1 2016. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars for q1 2017 and q1 2016 from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments. our overall gross margin dollars in q1 2017 increased by $1.0

operating income in q1 2017 compared to an operating loss in q1 2016, primarily driven by q1 2016 acquisition-related charges, primarily deferred revenue write-down and inventory valuation adjustment. due to the revaluation of deferred revenue to fair value, we excluded revenue of $99 million and associated costs that would have created $64 million of operating income in q1 2016. additionally, we incurred approximately $226 million of additional cost of sales charges that would have been excluded from the operating results in q1 2016 if the acquired inventory had not been remeasured to fair value upon acquisition and then sold to end customers, resulting in zero margin on that inventory for the period. operating expenses(dollars in millions) q1 2017 q1 2016research and development
