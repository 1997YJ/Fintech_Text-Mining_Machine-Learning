fiscal 2014, we continued to enhance our website and mobile experience, resulting in improved customer satisfaction scores and online sales conversion rates. sales from our online channels increased approximately 39% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year and now represent approximately 4.2% percent of our total net sales. also during the first quarter of

$19.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. the increase in net sales for the first quarter fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by customer transactions and average ticket growth. total comparable store sales increased 2.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to an increase of 4.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. the positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives and continued strength in our core categories, offset in part by the effects of extreme winter weather. all of our departments except two posted positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. comparable store sales for our tools, electrical, plumbing, kitchen, bath, hardware, décor, building materials, millwork and lighting product categories were above the company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. comparable store sales for our flooring, indoor garden and paint product categories were positive for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. comparable store sales for our outdoor garden and lumber product categories were negative for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, reflecting the impact of extreme winter weather and commodity price deflation.gross profit increased 3.1% to $6.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 from $6.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. gross profit as a percent of net sales was 35.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 34.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 5 basis points. the increase in gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was driven primarily by a lower penetration of lower margin product categories like lumber and outdoor garden. selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") were $4.2 billion for the first quarter of both fiscal 2014 and 2013. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 21.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 21.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, strong expense controls and lower management bonuses than last year.depreciation and amortization increased 3.0% to $414 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 from $402 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 2.1% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2014 and 2013. operating income increased 8.7% to $2.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 from $2.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. operating income as a percent of net sales was 11.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 10.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013.for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we recognized $91 million of interest and other, net, compared to $161 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 0.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. interest and other, net, for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 included a $97 million pretax gain related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in hd supply. our combined effective income tax rate was 36.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to 36.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. diluted earnings per share were $1.00 for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to $0.83 for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 reflect $0.04 of benefit related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in hd supply.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion compared to $2.7 billion for the same period in fiscal 2013. this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash flows from net working capital items as a result of a weather-related shift in sales to the second quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by an increase in net earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the same period last year.net cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was $280 million compared to $276 million for the same period in fiscal 2013. the amount of cash flow used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily capital expenditures, was consistent with the same period last year.net cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was $1.7 billion compared to $589 million for the same period of fiscal 2013. this change was primarily the result of $2.0 billion in net proceeds from long-term borrowings in 13table of contentsthe first quarter of fiscal 2013 offset by $946 million less in repurchases of common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013.in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into an asr agreement with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $950 million of our common stock. under this agreement, we paid $950 million to the financial institution and received a total of 12.1 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the $950 million asr agreement was determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the agreement. also in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million additional shares of our common stock for $300 million in the open market. we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with the programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in july 2017 and contains various restrictive covenants. at may 4, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. as of may 4, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.as of may 4, 2014, we had $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.14table of contents
