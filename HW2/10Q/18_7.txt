the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of august 1, 2016.40intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)overviewin q2 2016, our management approved and commenced the 2016 restructuring program to accelerate our transformation from a pc company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices.  virtuous cycle of growthour vision is if it is smart and connected, it is best with intel®. as a result, our strategy is to drive a “virtuous cycle of growth” that enables both the expansion of the data center and the proliferation of smart and connected things and devices and to continue to drive “moore’s law.” as more “things and devices” become smart and connected to the cloud, there is greater demand for data centers to not only connect these devices, but also to capture and analyze the data they create. in addition, our improvements in memory technology and field-programmable gate array (fpga) technology, will enable new classes of platforms that meet customer needs in the “cloud and data center” and “things and devices” market segments. threading this altogether is connectivity, which enables access to the cloud and an always-connected world. further enhanced by the economics of moore’s law, the virtuous cycle of growth drives synergistic growth in our client computing group (ccg), data center group (dcg), internet of things group (iotg), non-volatile memory solutions group (nsg), and programmable solutions group (psg) operating segments. for additional information regarding our strategy, see "business" in part i, item 1 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended

expected ccg and dcg revenue, which was partially offset by weakness in nsg and iotg. compared to q2 2015, the higher revenue was driven by higher average selling prices and the operating results of psg from the q1 2016 acquisition of altera. these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower platform unit sales and lower nsg revenue. gross margin of 58.9%, including approximately 3.0 pts of altera and other non-cash acquisition-related charges, is 0.9 pts above the midpoint of our previous business outlook of 58.0% and is down 3.6 points from q2 2015. operating income for the second quarter was $1.3 billion, down 54% on a year-on-year basis primarily driven by the restructuring charge and amortization of acquisition related intangibles. the tax rate for the quarter was 20.4%. net income for the second quarter was $1.3 billion, down 51% on a year-on-year basis. earnings per share was $0.27, down 28 cents on a year-on-year basis. our 2016 restructuring program is on-track and will drive long-term change as we increase our investments in the products and technologies that fuel our future growth. as a result of our restructuring program we recorded $1.4 billion in restructuring charges for the quarter. for additional information about the charges and savings from the restructuring programs, see "restructuring and other charges" in the md&a.41intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)compared to q2 2015, ccg revenue was down 3% and operating income increased 19%. dcg revenue was up 5% and operating income was down 4%. iotg revenue was up 2% and operating income was down 39%. nsg revenue was down 20% and operating loss was at $224 million. psg recognized $465 million in revenue and operating loss was at $62 million, which includes acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustment of $161 million. intel security group (isecg) revenue was up 10% and operating income was $97 million.our business continues to generate significant cash with $3.8 billion of cash from operations in q2 2016. during q2 2016, we purchased $2.3 billion in capital assets and returned cash to stockholders by paying $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchasing $804 million of common stock through our stock repurchase program. additionally, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in july 2016 of $0.26 per share of common stock to be paid in september 2016. we ended q2 2016 with $17.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets, up $2.6 billion from the first quarter. in q2 2016, we issued a total of $2.8 billion of long-term debt to refinance existing indebtedness. as of july 2, 2016, total debt was $28.6 billion.our business outlook for q3 2016 and full-year 2016 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general, and

driven by higher average selling prices, up 13% due to a lower mix of tablet and phone platform unit sales and a higher mix of dcg platform unit sales, along with the operating results of psg from the q1 2016 acquisition of altera corporation (altera). these increases in revenue were partially offset by lower platform unit sales of 13%, which were driven by lower tablet and phone, notebook, and desktop platform unit sales. to a lesser extent, the increase in revenue was partially offset by lower nsg revenue. our overall gross margin percentage was 58.9% in q2 2016, down from 62.5% in q2 2015. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by altera and other acquisition-related charges, nsg ramp, lower platform volume, higher platform unit cost, and higher factory start-up. the decrease in gross margin percentage was partially offset by higher platform average selling prices. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars for q2 2016 and q2 2015 from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments. our overall gross margin dollars in q2 2016 decreased by $275 million, or 3.3%, compared to q2 2015. the following results drove the change in

announced goals of a net reduction of approximately 12,000 positions globally and a net annual savings of approximately $1.6 billion. on an annual basis, we expect $1.4 billion of these savings will reduce our r&d and mg&a spending and the remainder will reduce our cost of sales. we began to realize these savings in q2 2016 and expect to fully realize these savings by mid-2017.2013 and 2015

increase in cash provided by operations was due to higher adjustments to net income for non-cash items in the second quarter of 2016 and changes in working capital. this increase was partially offset by lower net income. we recorded restructuring and other charges of $1.4 billion of which $604 million was paid in the first six months of 2016.  changes in assets and liabilities as of july 2, 2016, compared to december 26, 2015, included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits due to the payout of 2015 profit-dependent compensation and 2016 restructuring program benefits, as well as a

acquisitions.cash used for investing activities was higher for the first six months of 2016 compared to first six months of 2015. the increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of altera, higher purchases of available-for-sale investments, and net trading assets activity (which was a use of cash in the first six months of 2016 compared to a source of cash in the first six months of 2015). this activity was partially offset by higher sales and maturities of available-for-sale investments (including $835 million from sales of our investment in asml) and higher collections of loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements.  55intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.cash was provided by financing activities in the first six months of 2016 compared to cash used for financing in the first six months of 2015, primarily due to the increase in commercial paper outstanding and the issuance of long-term debt in q2 2016.liquidityduring 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera in an all-cash transaction. the transaction closed on december 28, 2015, during q1 2016. the transaction had an approximate value of $16.5 billion. we financed a portion of the acquisition by issuing $9.5 billion in long-term debt during 2015 and borrowing $4.0 billion against our short-term credit facility during q1 2016. we funded the remainder of the acquisition with issuances of commercial paper and existing cash and investments. for information on our indebtedness, see "note 14: borrowings."cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of july 2, 2016, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $17.7 billion ($25.3 billion as of december 26, 2015). the decreased balance compared to december 26, 2015 was primarily related to the cash consideration paid for our acquisition of altera, which closed on december 28, 2015. in addition to the $17.7 billion, we have $3.6 billion of other long-term investments, $1.6 billion of loans receivable and other investments, and $350 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority  are rated aa-/aa3 or better.other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $3.0 billion during the first six months of 2016 and $1.4 billion commercial paper remained outstanding as of july 2, 2016. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of july 2, 2016. on december 21, 2015, we entered into a short-term credit facility to borrow up to $5.0 billion to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of altera. under this credit facility we borrowed $4.0 billion, and the facility was closed in january 2016. in the second quarter of 2016, we issued a total of $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness, including our 1.95% senior notes due 2016 and a portion of our 1.35% senior notes due 2017. for further information on the terms of the notes, see “note 14: borrowings” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.as of july 2, 2016, $14.8 billion of our $17.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $14.8 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $1.4 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of july 2, 2016. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.56intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of july 2, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $19.2 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $7.8 billion was classified as level 1, $11.4 billion as level 2, and $37 million as level 3.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in active markets. we evaluate instrument-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt instrument is active.of the $11.4 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 45% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 55% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of july 2, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $710 million of loans receivable and $968 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of july 2, 2016, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $5.4 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.contractual obligationsduring q2 2016, we issued a total of $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness. during q1 2016, we acquired $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes as a result of our altera acquisition. our remaining total cash payments (including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the consolidated condensed balance sheets) over the life of these long-term debt obligations are expected to be approximately $6.3 billion. for further
