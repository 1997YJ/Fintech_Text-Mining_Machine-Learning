“believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described in “risk factors” in part i, item 1a of our annual report on form 10-k, and as may be updated in our subsequent quarterly reports on form 10-q. our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking

$14.6 billion was up 5% compared to q2 2014 and up 8% compared to q3 2013, and up 1% from the midpoint of the business outlook we provided in july 2014 of $14.4 billion. the increase from q2 2014 was largely due to increased pc client group (pccg) and data center group (dcg) platform unit sales driven by stability in mature markets and strength in enterprise, as well as growth in all segments of our data center business. the worldwide pc supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycles. net revenue for the pccg operating segment was up 6% compared to q2 2014 and up 9% compared to q3 2013. our notebook platform units increased as we are enabling innovative 2 in 1 devices and growing our market segment share by offering compelling platforms at lower price points. we had record net revenues in our dcg operating segment of $3.7 billion, up 5% compared to q2 2014 and up 16% compared to q3 2013. for q4 2014, we are forecasting a revenue midpoint of $14.7 billion, up 1% from q3 2014 and in line with the average seasonal increase.gross margin improved by half a percentage point from q2 2014 and down one percentage point from the business outlook we provided in july 2014. the increase from q2 2014 was primarily due to lower pccg and dcg platform (platform) unit costs on our 22-nanometer (nm) products and higher platform unit sales. these increases were mostly offset by higher production costs on our 14nm products treated as period charges. we are forecasting q4 2014 gross margin to be 64%, down one percentage point from q3 2014, due to higher platform unit costs and higher factory start-up costs, partially offset by lower production costs on 14nm.36intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)in q3 2014, we continued to ramp sales of our 5th generation intel® core™ processor family on 14nm process technology. we launched intel® core™ m processor, a new family of products, with full core performance in both compute and graphics in a fanless design, enabling new designs and form factors. we expect the first of these systems to be available for retail purchase in early q4 2014. in the data center market segment, we launched our next generation intel xeon processor e5 family platform, formally code-named grantley, on our 22nm process technology. we are customizing our intel xeon processor products for specific customers and workloads. in the wireless business, we qualified our second generation lte solution, featuring cat6 and carrier aggregation, in early q3 2014. our cat6 lte modem with carrier aggregation is now commercially available in the samsung galaxy alpha*. additionally, we expect to have our first integrated soc application processor and baseband 3g solution, code-named "sofia," available in q4 2014. we also remain on track to achieve our 40 million unit sales goal for tablets in fiscal year 2014. finally, we entered into a series of agreements with tsinghua unigroup ltd., an operating subsidiary of tsinghua holdings co. ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop intel® architecture and communications-based solutions for mobile phones. for further information, see "contractual obligations".our business continues to produce significant cash from operations, generating $5.7 billion in q3 2014. we ended q3 2014 with $15.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. during q3 2014, we purchased $2.4 billion in capital assets and returned cash to stockholders by repurchasing $4.2 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program and paying $1.1 billion in dividends. with the cash generated from operations, we intend to continue our repurchases of common stock, and as a result reduce our cash balances. additionally, the cash generated from operations is expected to enable sufficient liquidity for operations, provide the strategic flexibility to invest in our business and continue to return cash to our stockholders. in july 2014, the board of directors authorized an increase of $20 billion to the common stock repurchase program. as of september 27, 2014, $16.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. additionally, the board of directors declared a cash dividend in september 2014 of $0.225 per share of common stock to be paid in december 2014.our business outlook for q4 2014 and full-year 2014 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general and administrative (mg&a)), and capital expenditures. we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release. our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the

during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and at other times. the forward-looking statements in the business outlook and reiterated or updated in this form 10-q will be effective through the close of business on december 12, 2014 unless updated earlier or except as specifically noted otherwise in the business outlook. from the close of business on december 12, 2014 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for january 15, 2015, we will observe a “quiet period.”during

unit sales increased by 14% driven by strength in the traditional pc business. these increases were reduced by lower pccg and dcg platform average selling prices, which were down 3%, and higher cash consideration to our customers to meet competition by offsetting a higher bill of materials and system level costs associated with integrating our tablet platform.our overall gross margin dollars for q3 2014 increased by $1.0 billion, or 12%, compared to q3 2013. this increase was due to higher pccg and dcg platform revenue, approximately $580 million of lower pccg and dcg platform unit costs, and approximately $320 million of lower factory start-up costs primarily driven by our next generation 14nm process technology. these increases were partially offset by approximately $340 million of higher production costs on our 14nm products treated as period charges and approximately $190 million of combined higher cash consideration provided to customers associated with integrating our tablet platform and higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales.our overall gross margin percentage increased to 65.0% in q3 2014 from 62.4% in q3 2013. the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin increase in pccg. we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2014 and q3 2013 from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg

and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated condensed statements of income and within the “all other” operating segments category. the charges incurred during the first nine months of 2014 included $218 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements, which impacted approximately 2,800 employees. in q2 2014, we had estimated that 3,500 employees would be impacted by restructuring actions, but such number has decreased to 2,800 employees, mainly driven by the internal placement of previously impacted employees and the cancellation of prior quarter actions. most of the accrued restructuring balance as of september 27, 2014 relates to employee severance and benefits, which are expected to be paid within the next 12 months, and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated condensed balance sheets.since q3 2013, we have incurred a total of $478 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges. these charges included a total of $419 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,700 employees, and $59 million in asset impairment and other restructuring charges. we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately$500 million, which will be realized within r&d, cost of sales, and mg&a. we began to realize these savings in q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in q2 2015.44gains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other,

method investment, and our shares in clearwire corporation, which had been accounted for as available-for-sale marketable equity securities.we recognized an interest and other net gain in the first nine months of 2014 compared to a net loss in the first nine months of 2013 due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our intel media assets in 2014. for further information, see "note 8:

months of 2014 and the first nine months of 2013 was driven by the recognition of the full year of 2012 and first nine months of 2013 portion of the u.s. r&d tax credit. liquidity and capital

activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013, the $91 million decrease in cash provided by operations was due to changes in assets and liabilities, offset by higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items. the adjustments for non-cash items were higher in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to higher depreciation and lower gains on equity investments. income taxes paid, net of refunds, in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013 were $1.9 billion higher mostly due to 2012 income tax overpayments reducing income taxes paid in 2013 and higher income before taxes in 2014.changes in assets and liabilities as of september 27, 2014, compared to december 28, 2013, included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits due to the payout of 2013 profit-dependent compensation and a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments.for the first nine months of 2014, our three largest customers accounted for 46% of net revenue (44% for the first nine months of 2013) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 18% of our net revenue (17% for the first nine months of 2013), dell inc. accounting for 16% of our net revenue (15% for the first nine months of 2013), and lenovo group limited accounting for 12% of our net revenue (12% for the first nine months of 2013). these three customers accounted for 46% of net accounts receivable as of september 27, 2014 (34% as of december 28, 2013).investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.cash used for investing activities was lower for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013. cash used for investing activities decreased primarily due to lower purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets, higher maturities of available-for-sale investments, and lower cash paid for acquisitions. this decrease was partially offset by lower maturities and sales of trading assets and higher investments in non-marketable equity investments.financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.the increase in cash used for financing activities for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock.liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of september 27, 2014, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $15.6 billion ($20.1 billion as of december 28, 2013). in addition to the $15.6 billion, we have $2.2 billion of other long-term investments, $1.4 billion of loans receivable and other, and $450 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months, that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, which was fully available for use as of september 27, 2014. this ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $2.1 billion during the first nine months of 2014. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of september 27, 2014. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.46intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)as of september 27, 2014, $11.6 billion of our $15.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $11.6 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $2.0 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of september 27, 2014. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, working capital requirements, dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 3: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.marketable debt instrumentsas of september 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $16.9 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $6.8 billion was classified as level 1, $10.0 billion as level 2, and $120 million as level 3.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $10.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 50% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 50% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3, are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of september 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $758 million of loans receivable and $268 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of september 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.5 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.47intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)contractual obligationsduring q3 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with tsinghua unigroup ltd., an operating subsidiary of tsinghua holdings co. ltd., to among other things, jointly develop intel architecture and communications-based solutions for mobile phones. subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to rmb 9.0 billion (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of the holding company under tsinghua unigroup which will own spreadtrum communications and rda microelectronics. as of q3 2014, these amounts have not been recognized in our consolidated condensed balance sheet.
