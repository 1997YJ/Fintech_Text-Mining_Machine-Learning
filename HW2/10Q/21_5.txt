item 2.  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe following supplements management's discussion and analysis of mastercard incorporated for the year ended december 31, 2016 as contained in the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 15, 2017.  it also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated (together, “mastercard” or the “company”), included elsewhere in this report.  percentage changes provided throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.business overview mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks.  as the operator of what we believe is the world’s fastest payments network, we facilitate the switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) of payment transactions and deliver related products and services.  we make payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including mastercard®, maestro® and cirrus®.  we also provide value-added offerings such as safety and security products, information services and consulting, issuer and acquirer processing and loyalty and reward programs.  our network is designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system.  a typical transaction on our network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder (an individual who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), merchant, issuer (the cardholder’s financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution).  we do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our branded cards.  in most cases, cardholder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution customers.we generate revenue by charging fees to issuers, acquirers and other stakeholders for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services, as well as by assessing these customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or gross dollar volume (“gdv”), on the cards and other devices that carry our brands.our strategyour ability to grow our business is influenced by personal consumption expenditure growth, driving cash and check transactions toward electronic forms of payment, increasing our share in electronic payments and providing value-added products and services.  we achieve our strategy by growing, diversifying and building our business.grow.  we focus on growing our core businesses globally, including growing our consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions, increasing the number of payment transactions we switch.diversify.  we look to diversify our business and capabilities by focusing on:•diversifying our customer base in new and existing markets by working with partners such as governments, merchants, technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) and other businesses•encouraging use of our products and solutions in areas that provide new opportunities for electronic payments, such as transit, business-to-person transfers, business-to-business transfers and person-to-person transfers•capturing more payment flows by adding automated clearing house (ach) payments to our core card-based business via our recent acquisition of vocalink holdings limited•driving acceptance at merchants of all sizes•broadening financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked25table of contentsbuild.  we build our business by:•taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the evolving ways consumers interact and transact in the growing digital economy•providing value-added services across safety and security, consulting, data analytics and loyaltywe grow, diversify and build our business through a combination of organic growth and strategic investments, including acquisitions.strategic partners.  we work with a variety of stakeholders.  we provide financial institutions with solutions to help them increase revenue by driving preference for mastercard-branded products.  we help merchants by delivering data-driven insights and other services that help them grow and create simple and secure purchase experiences regardless of how and where their consumers shop.  we partner with technology companies such as digital players and mobile providers to deliver digital payment solutions powered by our technology, expertise and security protocols.  we help national and local governments drive increased financial inclusion and efficiency, reduce costs, increase transparency to reduce crime and corruption and advance social programs.   for consumers, we provide better, safer and more convenient ways to pay.business environment we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies.  net revenue generated in the united states was 37% and 39% of total net revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total net revenue in each period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time.  while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business.  adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate.  certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.mastercard’s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies.  in addition, political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance.  as a result, our revenue or results of operations may be negatively impacted.  we continue to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry.  notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for us to grow our business.for a full discussion of the various legal, regulatory and business risks that could impact our financial results,

for further information on the special item, the impact of foreign currency and the reconciliation to gaap reported amounts.we recorded net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the three months ended march 31, 2017 versus net income of $1.0 billion, or $0.86 per diluted share, in the comparable period in in 2016.  for the three months ended march 31, 2017, net income and diluted earnings per share increased 13% and 16%, respectively, versus the comparable period  in 2016. excluding the impact of the special item (see “non-gaap financial information” for further information on the special item, the impact of foreign currency and the reconciliation to gaap reported amounts), adjusted net income increased 14%, or 13% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three months ended march 31, 2017, versus the comparable period in 2016.  in addition, for the three months ended march 31, 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17% both as adjusted and on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2016.  27table of contentskey highlights for the three months ended march 31, 2017 were as follows:•net revenue increased 12% both as reported and on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2016, primarily driven by increases across our revenue categories, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives.  switched transactions increased 17%, gross dollar volume increased 8%, on a local currency basis and adjusted for the impact of the eu regulation change, and cross-border volume increased 13%, versus the comparable period in 2016. •operating expenses increased 12% versus the comparable period in 2016.  excluding the impact of the special item, adjusted operating expenses increased 11%, both as adjusted and on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2016.  the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs and timing of marketing spend.•the effective income tax rate decreased 1.4 percentage point to 26.9% for the three months ended march 31, 2017 versus 28.3% for the comparable period in 2016, due to a more favorable geographical mix of taxable earnings and the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to share-based payments in 2017, partially offset by a lower u.s. foreign tax credit benefit associated with the repatriation of current year foreign earnings.  other financial highlights for the three months ended march 31, 2017 were as follows:•we generated net cash flows from operations of $0.7 billion compared to $1.1 billion for the comparable period in 2016.•we repurchased 8.8 million shares and paid dividends of $238 million.non-gaap financial informationnon-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (“gaap”).  these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of a special item (“special item”) for a provision for litigation of $15 million ($10 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), which was recorded in the first quarter of 2017, relating to a proposed settlement for canadian merchant litigation (the “canadian merchant litigation provision”).  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item i of this report for further discussion.  mastercard excluded the canadian merchant litigation provision because our management monitors litigation judgments and settlements related to interchange and regulation separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. in addition, mastercard presents growth rates adjusted for the impact of foreign currency, which is a non-gaap financial measure.  we present currency-neutral growth rates, which are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results.  the impact of foreign currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.  the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  our management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency provides relevant information.mastercard’s management believes that the non-gaap financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.  our management uses non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.  the presentation of non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the our related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap.28table of contentsnet revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the special item and/or the impact of foreign currency are non-gaap financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with gaap.  the following

rounding.1 represents the foreign currency translational and transactional impact.impact of foreign currency ratesour overall operating results are impacted by foreign currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our u.s. dollar reporting currency.our operating results can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency.  the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency.  changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“gdv”) and gross euro volume (“gev”), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives.  in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period.  in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period.  as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currencies.  for example, our billing in australia is in the u.s. dollar, however, consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar.  the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollars to our u.s. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated.  the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar-converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis.  for the three months ended march 31, 2017, gdv on a u.s. dollar-converted basis increased 3%, while gdv on a local currency basis increased 5%, versus the comparable period in 2016.  further, the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction processing revenue, other revenue and operating expenses when the local currency of these items are different than the functional currency.in addition, we incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contracts (“foreign exchange activity”).  the impact of foreign exchange activity has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results (see “non-gaap financial information”) and is recorded in general and administrative expenses.  we attempt to manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are 29table of contentsdiscussed further in note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report.  since we do not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, we record gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize.we generate revenue and have financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation.  while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis, they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the u.s. dollar.financial resultsrevenuerevenue descriptionour business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders’ financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions).  our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services.  our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers.  our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers.  our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following:•domestic or cross-border transactions•signature-based or pin-based transactions•geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs•volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates•processed or not processed by mastercard•amount of usage of our other products or services•amount of rebates and incentives provided to customerswe classify our net revenue into the following five categories:1.domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same.  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.2.cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different.  in general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and may include fees for currency conversion.3.transaction processing revenue is earned for both domestic and cross-border transactions and is primarily based on the number of transactions.  transaction processing includes the following:•switched transactions include the following products and services:øauthorization is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval.  in certain circumstances, such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, mastercard or others, on behalf of the issuer approve in accordance with either the issuer’s instructions or applicable rules (also known as “stand-in”).30table of contentsøclearing is the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction.  we clear transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.øsettlement is facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.•connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages.  these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted  and the number of connections to our network.•other processing fees include issuer and acquirer processing solutions; payment gateways for e-commerce merchants; and mobile gateways for mobile initiated transactions.  4.other revenues: other revenues consist of other payment-related products and services and are primarily associated with the following:•consulting, data analytic and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, our professional advisory services group.•safety and security services fees are for products and services we offer to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and to ensure the safety of transactions made on mastercard products.  we work with issuers, merchants and governments to help deploy standards for safe and secure transactions for the global payments system. •loyalty and rewards solutions fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with mastercard-branded cards, such as access to a global airline lounge network, global and local concierge services, individual insurance coverages, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advance services and a 24-hour cardholder service center.  for merchants, we provide targeted offers and rewards campaigns and management services for publishing offers, as well as opportunities for holders of co-brand or loyalty cards and rewards program members to obtain rewards points faster.•program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.•we also charge for a variety of other payment-related products and services, including account and transaction enhancement services, rules compliance and publications.5.rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue.revenue analysisin the three months ended march 31, 2017, gross revenue increased 15%, both as reported and on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2016.  gross revenue growth in the three months ended march 31, 2017 was driven by an increase in transactions, dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, and other payment-related products and services.  rebates and incentives, in the three months ended march 31, 2017, increased 23% both as reported and on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes.  our net revenue for the three months ended march 31, 2017, increased 12% both as reported and on a currency-neutral basis, versus the comparable period in 2016.31table of

fee regulation related to card payments, which became effective in june 2016.  the regulation requires that we no longer collect fees on domestic european economic area payment transactions that do not use our network brand.  prior to that, we collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries, particularly france, on transactions with mastercard co-badged cards if the brands of domestic networks (as opposed to mastercard) were used.  as a result, the non-mastercard co-badged volume is no longer being included.the following table reflects gdv growth rates for europe and worldwide mastercard.  for comparability purposes, we adjusted growth rates for the impact of article 8 of the eu interchange fee regulation related to card payments, to exclude the prior period co-badged

the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue.  in addition, as part of our business strategy, mastercard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers.  these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances.  see our risk factor in “risk factor - business risks” in part i, item 1a of our annual report on

comparable period in 2016 were:•personnel expenses increased 14%, or 15% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three months ended march 31, 2017, versus the comparable period in 2016.  the increase was driven by a higher number of employees to support our continued investment in the areas of digital, geographic expansion, advisors consulting and data analytics. •data processing and telecommunication expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer systems and other telecommunication systems.  the increase is due to capacity growth of our business and higher third-party processing costs.  •foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.  see note 13 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 for further discussion.  there were no significant changes in the foreign exchange activity for the three months ended march 31, 2017, versus the comparable period in 2016. •other expenses include costs to provide loyalty and rewards solutions, travel and meeting expenses and rental expense for our facilities.  other expenses for the three months ended march 31, 2017, were relatively flat versus the comparable period in 2016. advertising and marketingour brands, principally mastercard, are valuable strategic assets that drive acceptance and usage of our products and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally.  our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotions, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale.  we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences.  advertising and marketing expenses increased 25%, or 27% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three months ended march 31, 2017, versus the comparable period in 2016, mainly due to timing of marketing spend.depreciation and amortizationdepreciation and amortization expenses decreased 2%, or 1% on a currency-neutral basis, for the three months ended march 31, 2017, versus the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to lower amortization from certain intangibles becoming fully amortized, partially offset by higher depreciation from capital investments.provision for litigation settlementduring the three months ended march 31, 2017, we recorded a provision for litigation of $15 million related to a proposed settlement for canadian merchant litigation (the “canadian merchant litigation provision”).  see note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report for further discussion.35table of contentsother income (expense)other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses.  total other income (expense) increased $17 million for the three months ended march 31, 2017, versus the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in november 2016, partially offset by higher investment income.income taxes the effective income tax rates were 26.9% and 28.3% for the three months ended march 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  for the three months ended march 31, 2017, the effective tax rate was lower than the comparable period in 2016, due to a more favorable geographical mix of taxable earnings and the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to share-based payments in 2017, partially offset by a lower u.s. foreign tax credit benefit associated with the repatriation of current year foreign earnings.liquidity and capital resourceswe need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations.  we generate the cash required to meet these needs through operations.  the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us at march 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016: march 31, 2017 december 31, 2016 (in billions)cash, cash equivalents and investments 1$7.7 $8.3unused line of credit3.8 3.81 investments include available-for-sale securities and short-term held-to-maturity securities.  both at march 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, this amount excludes restricted cash related to the u.s. merchant class litigation settlement of $543 million.  this amount also excludes restricted security deposits held for customers of $984 million and $991 million at march 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively.cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $4.0 billion and $3.8 billion at march 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively, or 52% and 45% as of such dates.  it is our present intention to indefinitely reinvest historic undistributed accumulated earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings.  if these earnings are needed for u.s. operations or can no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states, we would be required to record a liability for such u.s. taxes for the historic undistributed accumulated earnings at that time.  such taxes would be due upon repatriation of such earnings to the united states.our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions.  we guarantee the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers.  see note 12 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part i, item 1 of this report for further information of these guarantees.  historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of the future.  the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.  our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party.  for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see part i, item 1a - risk factors of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016; note 11 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this report; and “business environment” within this section of this report.36table of

associated with our existing operations and potential obligations.debt and credit availabilityour long-term debt was $5.2 billion at both march 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, with the earliest maturity of principal occurring in 2019.we have a commercial paper program (the “commercial paper program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $3.75 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.  in conjunction with the commercial paper program, we have entered into a committed unsecured $3.75 billion revolving credit facility (the “credit facility”) which expires in october 2021.  we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants of the credit facility as of march 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016.  the majority of credit facility lenders are our customers or their affiliates.borrowings under the commercial paper program and the credit facility are to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers.  in addition, we may 37table of contentsborrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes.  we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility or the commercial paper program at march 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016. see note 12 (debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016 for further discussion of long-term debt, the commercial paper program and the credit facility.dividends and share repurchases we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock.  subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend.  however, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.aggregate payments for quarterly dividends totaled $238 million and $212 million for the three months ended march 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.on december 6, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share paid on february 9, 2017 to holders of record on january 9, 2017 of our class a common stock and class b common stock.  the aggregate amount of this dividend was $238 million.  on february 7, 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share payable on may 9, 2017 to holders of record on april 7, 2017 of our class a common stock and class b common stock.  the aggregate amount of this dividend will be $236 million.repurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock.  the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions.  in december 2016, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $4 billion of its class a common stock.  this program will become effective after completion of the share repurchase program authorized in december 2015. the following table
