item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2012, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a. "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.overviewour mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. we build products that support our mission by creating utility for users, developers, and marketers:users. we enable people who use facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.developers. we enable developers to use the facebook platform to build applications (apps) and websites that integrate with facebook to reach our global network of users and to build products that are more personalized, social, and engaging.marketers. we enable marketers to engage with more than one billion monthly active users on facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. we offer marketers a unique combination of reach, relevance, social context, and engagement to enhance the value of their ads.we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers. in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded revenue of $2,016 million, income from operations of $736 million and net income of $425 million. in the first nine months of 2013, we recorded revenue of $5,286 million, income from operations of $1,672 million and net income of $977 million. 22trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), monthly active users (maus), mobile maus and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram unless otherwise specifically stated. •daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or app that is integrated with facebook, on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey, asia includes all users in australia and new zealand, and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 23worldwide daus increased 25% to 728 million on average during september 2013 from 584 million during september 2012. we experienced growth in daus across major markets including brazil, india, and the united states. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook. on average during september 2013, the number of daus using personal computers decreased modestly compared to the same period in 2012. worldwide mobile daus were 507 million on average during september 2013.•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or app that is integrated with facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.     as of september 30, 2013, we had 1.19 billion maus, an increase of 18% from september 30, 2012. users in india and brazil represented key sources of growth in the third quarter of 2013 relative to the prior year.24•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile app or via versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, during the period of measurement. worldwide mobile maus increased 45% to 874 million as of september 30, 2013 from 604 million as of september 30, 2012. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus are accessing facebook through mobile devices, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile growth over the third quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012. there were 254 million mobile maus who accessed facebook solely through mobile apps or our mobile website during the month ended september 30, 2013, increasing 102% from 126 million during the same period in 2012. the remaining 620 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during september 2013. while most of our mobile users also access facebook through personal computers, we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers may be flat or decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia. this is in part due to our focus on developing mobile products to encourage mobile usage of facebook.25trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users.    note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 26during the third quarter of 2013, worldwide arpu was $1.72, an increase of 33% from the third quarter of 2012. over this period, arpu increased by 40% or more in each of the four geographic regions disclosed above. user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region. components of results of operationsrevenuewe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers.advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the facebook website or mobile app and third-party affiliated websites or mobile apps. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by our users, the number of actions taken by our users or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. whether we count the initial display only or every display of an ad as an impression is dependent on where the ad is displayed. for example, an individual ad in news feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day; however, only the initial display of the ad is considered an impression, regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the news feed to a particular user.payments and other fees. we enable payments from our users to our platform developers. our users can transact and make payments on the facebook platform by using credit cards, paypal or other payment methods available on our website. we receive a fee from our platform developers when users make purchases from our platform developers using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our platform developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game apps on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue consists primarily of user promoted posts, our ad serving and measurement products and, to a lesser extent, facebook gifts revenue. such revenue has been immaterial in recent periods.cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. general and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we acquired.27results of operationsthe following table set forth our condensed consolidated statements of operations data:    three months ended september 30, nine months ended september

respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. the increases were due primarily to increases in advertising revenue.advertising revenue increased $712 million, or 66%, and $1,691 million, or 57%, in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. advertising revenue grew due to a 16% and 32% increase in the number of ads delivered during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, and a 42% and 19% increase in the average price per ad as compared to those same periods in 2012. the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth in these periods was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. news feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, we estimate that advertising revenue from news feed ads on mobile devices represented approximately 49% and 41%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 14% and 6% in the same periods in 2012. revenue from news feed ads on mobile devices increased 33% compared 29to the second quarter of 2013 due to increases in: the average price per mobile ad; the number of mobile users; and the number of ads shown per mobile user. other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth and advertising price and volume trends in these periods included: (i) an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook which we believe increased demand for our ads; (ii) 25% growth in average daus and 18% growth in maus from september 30, 2012 to september 30, 2013, which increased the number of ads we delivered; (iii) an increase in the number of ads displayed in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers; and (iv) other product changes, including our decision in the fourth quarter of 2012 to lower our market reserve price, i.e. the minimum price threshold accepted in our ads auction. we believe the reserve price change significantly increased the number of ads delivered and reduced the average price per ad, and overall had a modest positive effect on revenue in the 2013 periods. payments and other fees revenue in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013 increased $42 million, or 24%, and $91 million, or 16%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. the increase in payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased payments revenue from games played on facebook on personal computers, and to a lesser extent, the inclusion of other fees revenue in 2013 from user promoted posts, our ad serving and measurement products, and facebook gifts.cost of revenue three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2013 2012 %change 2013 2012 %change (in millions, except for percentages)cost of

43%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. the increases in both periods were primarily due to operational expenses related to expanding our own data centers, including $85 million and $230 million increases in depreciation for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively. in addition, we recognized $43 million and $108 million of lease abandonment expense in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, primarily due to exiting certain leased data centers resulting from the migration of operations to our own data centers. in the event that circumstances change such that we decide to re-occupy and utilize any of these abandoned data centers, we would reverse the remaining lease abandonment liability associated with those facilities. the increase in cost of revenue for the first nine months of 2013 was partially offset by a $48 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to the same period in 2012 mainly due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to rsus granted prior to january 1, 2011 (pre-2011 rsus) as a result of our ipo in may 2012.research and development  three months ended

of expense in the prior period related to pre-2011 rsus as a result of our ipo in may 2012. this decrease was mostly offset by an increase in payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 46% growth in employee headcount from september 30, 2012 to september 30, 2013 in engineering and other technical functions. this investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new

other income, net in the third quarter of 2013 increased $5 million compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to a foreign exchange gain recognized in the third quarter of 2013 resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. other income, net in the first nine months of 2013 decreased $7 million compared 31to the same period in 2012 primarily due to an increase

taxes$301 $431 (30)% $647 $— nmeffective tax rate41% 116%   40% —%  our provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2013 and 2012 was $301 million and $431 million, respectively, and $647 million for the first nine months of 2013. there was no provision for income taxes for the first nine months of 2012. the change in our provision for income taxes is primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013.  our effective tax rate decreased in the third quarter 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes and a reduction in the amount of non-deductible share-based compensation expense that was recognized. a comparison of our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2013 to the same period in 2012 is not meaningful since our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate were both zero in the same period in 2012.our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation expense and losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit. these losses were primarily due to the initial start-up costs incurred by our foreign subsidiaries to operate in certain foreign jurisdictions, including the costs incurred by those subsidiaries to license, develop, and use our intellectual property. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions.liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds and u.s. government and u.s. government agency securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $9.33 billion as of september 30, 2013, a decrease of $298 million from december 31, 2012, primarily due to the repayment of our $1.5 billion term loan. in addition, we used $879 million for purchases of property and equipment, $706 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, $291 million for principal payments on capital lease transactions and $237 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets. these decreases were partially offset by $2.99 billion of cash generated from operations which included the receipt of an income tax refund of $419 million. beginning in 2014, we intend to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover such taxes upon vesting of such awards (sell-to-cover), rather than our current approach of net share settlement. we expect this sell-to-cover approach will reduce our cash outflows. we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.in august 2013, in connection with the termination of our existing credit facilities, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 revolving credit facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15, 2018. as of september 30, 2013, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. see note 8 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 for additional detail.as of september 30, 2013, $531 million of the $9.33 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided for the additional taxes that would be due if we repatriated these funds for use in our operations in the united states.32cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2013 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including total depreciation and amortization of $737 million and share-based compensation expense of $633 million, and the receipt of an income tax refund of $419 million. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was mainly due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for certain non-cash items, and the receipt of an income tax refund of $419 million. cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2013 primarily resulted from $879 million for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers and buildings, $237 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents, partially offset by $1.02 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. the decrease in cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was mainly due to proceeds from $1.02 billion in net sales and maturities of marketable securities in the first nine months of 2013 compared to use of $5.61 billion from net purchases of marketable securities in the same period in 2012. in addition, we used less cash to acquire businesses and other assets in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2013 of approximately $1.4 billion. cash (used in) provided by financing activitiescash used in financing activities was $2.19 billion for the first nine months of 2013, primarily resulted from $1.5 billion for repayment of debt and $706 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement of equity awards. because our rsus granted on or after january 1, 2011 only began to settle in 2013, the total tax payments of $706 million included approximately $185 million related to rsus that vested prior to 2013 but were not settled until the first quarter of 2013.cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 billion for the first nine months of 2012 primarily related to $6.76 billion in net proceeds from our ipo.off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of september 30, 2013.contractual obligationsthere were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012, other than the repayment of our $1.5 billion term loan.contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 9 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.33we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012. item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2012, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a. "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.overviewour mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. we build products that support our mission by creating utility for users, developers, and marketers:users. we enable people who use facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.developers. we enable developers to use the facebook platform to build applications (apps) and websites that integrate with facebook to reach our global network of users and to build products that are more personalized, social, and engaging.marketers. we enable marketers to engage with more than one billion monthly active users on facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. we offer marketers a unique combination of reach, relevance, social context, and engagement to enhance the value of their ads.we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers. in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded revenue of $2,016 million, income from operations of $736 million and net income of $425 million. in the first nine months of 2013, we recorded revenue of $5,286 million, income from operations of $1,672 million and net income of $977 million. 22trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), monthly active users (maus), mobile maus and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram unless otherwise specifically stated. •daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or app that is integrated with facebook, on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey, asia includes all users in australia and new zealand, and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 23worldwide daus increased 25% to 728 million on average during september 2013 from 584 million during september 2012. we experienced growth in daus across major markets including brazil, india, and the united states. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook. on average during september 2013, the number of daus using personal computers decreased modestly compared to the same period in 2012. worldwide mobile daus were 507 million on average during september 2013.•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or app that is integrated with facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.     as of september 30, 2013, we had 1.19 billion maus, an increase of 18% from september 30, 2012. users in india and brazil represented key sources of growth in the third quarter of 2013 relative to the prior year.24•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile app or via versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, during the period of measurement. worldwide mobile maus increased 45% to 874 million as of september 30, 2013 from 604 million as of september 30, 2012. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus are accessing facebook through mobile devices, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile growth over the third quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012. there were 254 million mobile maus who accessed facebook solely through mobile apps or our mobile website during the month ended september 30, 2013, increasing 102% from 126 million during the same period in 2012. the remaining 620 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during september 2013. while most of our mobile users also access facebook through personal computers, we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers may be flat or decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia. this is in part due to our focus on developing mobile products to encourage mobile usage of facebook.25trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users.    note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 26during the third quarter of 2013, worldwide arpu was $1.72, an increase of 33% from the third quarter of 2012. over this period, arpu increased by 40% or more in each of the four geographic regions disclosed above. user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region. components of results of operationsrevenuewe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers.advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the facebook website or mobile app and third-party affiliated websites or mobile apps. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by our users, the number of actions taken by our users or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. whether we count the initial display only or every display of an ad as an impression is dependent on where the ad is displayed. for example, an individual ad in news feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day; however, only the initial display of the ad is considered an impression, regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the news feed to a particular user.payments and other fees. we enable payments from our users to our platform developers. our users can transact and make payments on the facebook platform by using credit cards, paypal or other payment methods available on our website. we receive a fee from our platform developers when users make purchases from our platform developers using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our platform developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game apps on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue consists primarily of user promoted posts, our ad serving and measurement products and, to a lesser extent, facebook gifts revenue. such revenue has been immaterial in recent periods.cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. general and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we acquired.27results of operationsthe following table set forth our condensed consolidated statements of operations data:    three months ended september 30, nine months ended september

respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. the increases were due primarily to increases in advertising revenue.advertising revenue increased $712 million, or 66%, and $1,691 million, or 57%, in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. advertising revenue grew due to a 16% and 32% increase in the number of ads delivered during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, and a 42% and 19% increase in the average price per ad as compared to those same periods in 2012. the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth in these periods was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. news feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, we estimate that advertising revenue from news feed ads on mobile devices represented approximately 49% and 41%, respectively, of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 14% and 6% in the same periods in 2012. revenue from news feed ads on mobile devices increased 33% compared 29to the second quarter of 2013 due to increases in: the average price per mobile ad; the number of mobile users; and the number of ads shown per mobile user. other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth and advertising price and volume trends in these periods included: (i) an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook which we believe increased demand for our ads; (ii) 25% growth in average daus and 18% growth in maus from september 30, 2012 to september 30, 2013, which increased the number of ads we delivered; (iii) an increase in the number of ads displayed in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers; and (iv) other product changes, including our decision in the fourth quarter of 2012 to lower our market reserve price, i.e. the minimum price threshold accepted in our ads auction. we believe the reserve price change significantly increased the number of ads delivered and reduced the average price per ad, and overall had a modest positive effect on revenue in the 2013 periods. payments and other fees revenue in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013 increased $42 million, or 24%, and $91 million, or 16%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. the increase in payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased payments revenue from games played on facebook on personal computers, and to a lesser extent, the inclusion of other fees revenue in 2013 from user promoted posts, our ad serving and measurement products, and facebook gifts.cost of revenue three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2013 2012 %change 2013 2012 %change (in millions, except for percentages)cost of

43%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2012. the increases in both periods were primarily due to operational expenses related to expanding our own data centers, including $85 million and $230 million increases in depreciation for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively. in addition, we recognized $43 million and $108 million of lease abandonment expense in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013, respectively, primarily due to exiting certain leased data centers resulting from the migration of operations to our own data centers. in the event that circumstances change such that we decide to re-occupy and utilize any of these abandoned data centers, we would reverse the remaining lease abandonment liability associated with those facilities. the increase in cost of revenue for the first nine months of 2013 was partially offset by a $48 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to the same period in 2012 mainly due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to rsus granted prior to january 1, 2011 (pre-2011 rsus) as a result of our ipo in may 2012.research and development  three months ended

in employee headcount from september 30, 2012 to september 30, 2013 in engineering and other technical functions. this investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new

other income, net in the third quarter of 2013 increased $5 million compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to a foreign exchange gain recognized in the third quarter of 2013 resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. other income, net in the first nine months of 2013 decreased $7 million compared 31to the same period in 2012 primarily due to an increase

taxes$301 $431 (30)% $647 $— nmeffective tax rate41% 116%   40% —%  our provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2013 and 2012 was $301 million and $431 million, respectively, and $647 million for the first nine months of 2013. there was no provision for income taxes for the first nine months of 2012. the change in our provision for income taxes is primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013.  our effective tax rate decreased in the third quarter 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes and a reduction in the amount of non-deductible share-based compensation expense that was recognized. a comparison of our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2013 to the same period in 2012 is not meaningful since our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate were both zero in the same period in 2012.our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation expense and losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit. these losses were primarily due to the initial start-up costs incurred by our foreign subsidiaries to operate in certain foreign jurisdictions, including the costs incurred by those subsidiaries to license, develop, and use our intellectual property. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions.liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds and u.s. government and u.s. government agency securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $9.33 billion as of september 30, 2013, a decrease of $298 million from december 31, 2012, primarily due to the repayment of our $1.5 billion term loan. in addition, we used $879 million for purchases of property and equipment, $706 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, $291 million for principal payments on capital lease transactions and $237 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets. these decreases were partially offset by $2.99 billion of cash generated from operations which included the receipt of an income tax refund of $419 million. beginning in 2014, we intend to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover such taxes upon vesting of such awards (sell-to-cover), rather than our current approach of net share settlement. we expect this sell-to-cover approach will reduce our cash outflows. we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.in august 2013, in connection with the termination of our existing credit facilities, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 revolving credit facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15, 2018. as of september 30, 2013, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. see note 8 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 for additional detail.as of september 30, 2013, $531 million of the $9.33 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided for the additional taxes that would be due if we repatriated these funds for use in our operations in the united states.32cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2013 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including total depreciation and amortization of $737 million and share-based compensation expense of $633 million, and the receipt of an income tax refund of $419 million. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was mainly due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for certain non-cash items, and the receipt of an income tax refund of $419 million. cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2013 primarily resulted from $879 million for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers and buildings, $237 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents, partially offset by $1.02 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. the decrease in cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was mainly due to proceeds from $1.02 billion in net sales and maturities of marketable securities in the first nine months of 2013 compared to use of $5.61 billion from net purchases of marketable securities in the same period in 2012. in addition, we used less cash to acquire businesses and other assets in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2013 of approximately $1.4 billion. cash (used in) provided by financing activitiescash used in financing activities was $2.19 billion for the first nine months of 2013, primarily resulted from $1.5 billion for repayment of debt and $706 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement of equity awards. because our rsus granted on or after january 1, 2011 only began to settle in 2013, the total tax payments of $706 million included approximately $185 million related to rsus that vested prior to 2013 but were not settled until the first quarter of 2013.cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 billion for the first nine months of 2012 primarily related to $6.76 billion in net proceeds from our ipo.off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of september 30, 2013.contractual obligationsthere were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012, other than the repayment of our $1.5 billion term loan.contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 9 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.33we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2012.
