item 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our prospectus filed pursuant to rule 424(b) under the securities act of 1933, as amended, with the securities and exchange commission on may 18, 2012 (prospectus). in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a. “risk factors.” for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled “—limitations of key metrics.”overviewour mission is to make the world more open and connected. facebook enables you to express yourself and connect with the world around you instantly and freely.we build products that support our mission by creating utility for users, developers, and advertisers:users. we enable people who use facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.developers. we enable developers to use the facebook platform to build applications (apps) and websites that integrate with facebook to reach our global network of users and to build products that are more personalized, social, and engaging.advertisers. we enable advertisers to engage with more than one billion monthly active users (maus) on facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. we offer advertisers a unique combination of reach, relevance, social context, and engagement to enhance the value of their ads.we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers. in the third quarter of 2012, we recorded revenue of $1,262 million, income from operations of $377 million and net loss of $59 million. in the first nine months of 2012, we recorded revenue of $3,504 million, income from operations of $15 million and net loss of $11 million. total costs and expenses grew more than revenue, due to increased headcount and significant increases in share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses for restricted stock units (rsus) during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012. during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, we recognized $148 million and $1,510 million, respectively, of share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses. of these amounts, $1,098 million was due to the recognition of share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses related to rsus granted prior to january 1, 2011 (pre-2011 rsus) triggered by the completion of our initial public offering (ipo) in may 2012. for the third quarter of 2012, we incurred a net loss despite generating income before provision for income taxes due to our effective tax rate exceeding 100%. our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit.19table of contentstrends in our user metrics•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website that is integrated with facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community, which has grown substantially in the past several years.     note: for purposes of reporting maus, daus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey, asia includes all users in australia and new zealand, and rest of world includes africa, latin america, and the middle east. in june 2012, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the first quarter of 2012. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide mau number, it did affect our attribution of users to different geographic regions. the first quarter of 2012 user metrics reflect the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region.as of september 30, 2012, we had 1.01 billion maus, an increase of 26% from september 30, 2011. users in brazil, india, and japan represented key sources of growth in the third quarter of 2012 relative to the prior year. we had 61 million maus in brazil as of september 30, 2012, an increase of 109% compared to the same period in 2011; we had 65 million maus in india as of september 30, 2012, an increase of 62% compared to the same period in 2011; and we had 18 million maus in japan as of september 30, 2012, an increase of 218% compared to the same period in 2011. additionally, we had 171 million maus in the united states as of september 30, 2012, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2011. 20table of contents•daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website that is integrated with facebook, on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement. note: for non-worldwide dau user numbers presented for the periods marked march 31, 2012 and june 30, 2012, the figures represent an average of the first 25 days of the period and the last 27 days of the period, respectively, in order to avoid using data subject to the algorithm error described in the mau section above. these average numbers do not meaningfully differ from the average numbers when calculated over a full month.worldwide daus increased 28% to 584 million on average during september 2012 from 457 million during september 2011. we experienced growth in daus across major markets including brazil, india and japan. overall growth in daus was driven largely by increased mobile usage of facebook. relative to june 30, 2012, daus increased from 552 million to 584 million, primarily due to an increase in mobile users. during the third quarter of 2012, the number of daus using personal computers increased modestly compared to the second quarter of 2012, but in certain key markets such as the united states and europe the number of daus using personal computers was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter after having decreased modestly during the second quarter of 2012.21table of contents•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile app or via mobile-optimized versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet such as the ipad, during the period of measurement. worldwide mobile maus increased by 61% from 376 million as of september 30, 2011 to 604 million as of september 30, 2012. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus are accessing facebook through mobile devices, with users in india, brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile growth over this period. approximately 126 million mobile maus accessed facebook solely through mobile apps or our mobile website during the month ended september 30, 2012, increasing 24% from 102 million during the month ended june 30, 2012. the remaining 478 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during that month. while most of our mobile users also access facebook through personal computers, we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will exceed the growth in usage through personal computers for the foreseeable future and that the usage through personal computers may be flat or continue to decline in certain markets, including key developed markets such as the united states, in part due to our focus on developing mobile products to encourage mobile usage of facebook.the number of maus, daus and mobile maus discussed above do not include instagram users unless such users would otherwise qualify as maus, daus and mobile maus, respectively, based on activity that is shared back to facebook.22table of contents trends in our monetization by user geographywe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual goods are purchased. we define average revenue per user (arpu) as our total revenue in a given geography during a given period, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the period. our revenue and arpu in markets such as the united states, canada, and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to advertisers and users.   note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the advertiser or developer. in june 2012, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the first quarter of 2012. the first quarter of 2012 arpu amount for the united states & canada region reflects an adjustment based on the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region.23table of contentsduring the third quarter of 2012, worldwide arpu was $1.29, an increase of 4% from the third quarter of 2011. over this period, arpu increased by approximately 20% in the united states and canada and rest of world, and by 4% and 2% in asia and europe, respectively. arpu in europe declined compared to the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to a decline in payments and other fees revenue and advertising revenue being flat due, we believe, to seasonality traditionally experienced in the third quarter. user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.limitations of key metricsthe numbers of our maus and daus and arpu are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. for example, there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service, despite our efforts to detect and suppress such behavior. we estimate, for example, that “duplicate” accounts (an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account) may have represented approximately 4.8% of our worldwide maus as of june 30, 2012. we also seek to identify “false” accounts, which we divide into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) undesirable accounts, which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as spamming. as of june 30, 2012, for example, we estimate user-misclassified accounts may have represented approximately 2.4% of our worldwide maus and undesirable accounts may have represented approximately 1.5% of our worldwide maus. we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or australia and higher in developing markets such as indonesia and turkey. however, these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination, such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. as such, our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts. we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts, and such estimates may be affected by improvements or changes in our methodology.our metrics are also affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved, and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs. for example, we estimate that less than 5% of our estimated worldwide daus as of december 31, 2011 and 2010 resulted from this type of automatic mobile activity, and that this type of activity had a substantially smaller effect on our estimate of worldwide maus and mobile maus. the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varies by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world. in addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user’s ip address and self-disclosed location. these factors may not always accurately reflect the user’s actual location. for example, a mobile-only user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user’s actual location. the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. for example, in early june 2012, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the period ended march 31, 2012. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide mau number, it did affect our attribution of users to different geographic regions. we estimate that the number of maus as of march 31, 2012 for the united states and canada region was overstated as a result of the error by approximately 3% and these overstatements were offset by understatements in other regions. in addition, our estimates for revenue by user location are also affected by these factors. we regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating these metrics to improve their accuracy. in addition, our mau and dau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology. for example, some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses.24table of contentscomponents of results of operationsrevenuewe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers.advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the facebook website or mobile app and third-party affiliated websites. advertisers pay for ad products which include sponsored stories in news feed, either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of clicks made by our users. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads or sponsored stories in the period in which a user clicks on the content. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads or sponsored stories in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad or sponsored story is displayed to users. an individual sponsored story in news feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day; however, in general, only the initial display of the sponsored story is considered an impression, regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the news feed.payments and other fees. we enable payments from our users to our platform developers. our users can transact and make payments on the facebook platform by using credit cards, paypal or other payment methods available on our website. we receive a fee from our platform developers when users make purchases from our platform developers using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our platform developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game apps on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. cumulatively to date, games from zynga have generated the majority of our payments and other fees revenue. however, zynga's contribution to our payments and other fees revenue has decreased over time and this trend may continue. our other fees revenue has been immaterial in recent periods. cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, developer-, and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. general and administrative expenses also include legal settlements.we have reclassified certain prior period expense amounts from marketing and sales to general and administrative within our condensed consolidated statements of operations to conform to our current period presentation. these reclassifications did not affect revenue, total costs and expenses, income from operations, or net (loss) income.25table of contentsresults of operationsthe following table summarizes our historical condensed consolidated statements of operations data (in

the first nine months of 2012 increased $308 million, or 32%, and $924 million, or 36%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2011. the increase was due primarily to a 36% and 33% increase in advertising revenue during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2011. in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of adverting revenue was 14% and 6%, respectively. as mobile advertising was not offered prior to the first quarter of 2012, comparisons to prior year are not meaningful. advertising revenue grew primarily due to a 27% increase in the number of ads delivered during both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 and to a lesser extent, due to a 7% and 5% increase in the average price per ad in those same periods.the increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth. maus grew 26% from september 30, 2011 to september 30, 2012 and average daus grew 28% from september 2011 to september 2012. various product changes and changes in user engagement generally offset in their impact on the average number of ads per user. for example, the shift to greater mobile use generally reduced ads per user, while the introduction of sponsored stories in news feed increased the number of ads per user. the rate of change in number of ads delivered also differs by geography, driven by factors such as mobile penetration. for example, europe and rest of world increased at a faster rate than the united states and asia. growth in the average price per ad for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in price per ad in the united states, which benefited from growth in sponsored stories in news feed across desktop and mobile devices during the second and third quarters of 2012. sponsored stories in news feed have a significantly higher average price per ad due to factors which include the prominent position of the sponsored stories. the increase in price per ad in the united states was partially offset by an increased percentage of our worldwide ads being delivered in the asia and rest of world geographies where the average price per ad, while growing on a year-over-year basis, is relatively lower. the average price per ad was also affected by a decline in the average price per ad in europe in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes and, in part, we believe, to continuing weak economic conditions in that region affecting advertiser demand.payments and other fees revenue in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 increased to $176 million, or 13%, and $554 million, or 50%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2011. payments revenue declined compared to the second quarter of 2012, we believe due primarily to users migrating from better monetizing simulation game-types towards lower monetizing arcade and puzzle game-types, as well as a shift in gaming activity to mobile devices which do not use our payments product. facebook payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the facebook platform with limited exceptions on july 1, 2011. accordingly, comparisons of payments and other fees revenue to periods before this date may not be meaningful. our payments terms and conditions provide for a 30-day claim period subsequent to a payments transaction during which the customer may dispute the virtual or digital goods transaction. to date, we have deferred recognition of payments revenue until the expiration of this period as we were unable to make reasonable and reliable estimates of future refunds or chargebacks arising during this claim period, due to lack of historical transactional information. in the fourth quarter of 2012, we will have 24 months of historical transactional information which we currently anticipate will enable us to estimate future refunds and chargebacks. accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2012 we expect to record all payments revenues at the time of the purchase of the related virtual or digital goods, net of estimated refunds or chargebacks. we anticipate that this change will result in a one-time increase in payments revenue in the fourth quarter.seven percent and nine percent of our total revenue for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, respectively, and 12% of our total revenue for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2011, came from a single customer, zynga. revenue from zynga consisted of payments processing fees related to their sale of virtual goods and from direct advertising purchased by zynga. 27table of contentscost of revenue  three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2012 2011 %change 2012 2011 %change (in millions, except for

million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 mainly due to recognition of expense related to pre-2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and, to a lesser extent, rsus granted on or after january 1, 2011 (post-2011 rsus). increases in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 53% increase in employee headcount also contributed to increases in cost of revenue during the periods presented. these expenses supported our user growth, the increased usage of our products by users, developers, and advertisers, and the launch of new products.research and development  three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2012 2011 %change 2012 2011 %change (in millions, except for percentages)research and

geographic mix of our income. our provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2012 decreased by $478 million compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to the loss before provision for income taxes.our effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 increased compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to the impact of certain non-deductible share-based compensation expense that was recognized during the period and additional losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit, and the expiration of the federal tax credit for research and development activities. the impact of these items on our effective tax rate is significantly greater when our income before provision for income taxes is lower. 29table of contentsour effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2012 was zero because the discrete tax items that arose during the first nine months of 2012 offset the income tax benefit that was based on applying our estimated annual effective tax rate to our loss before provision for income taxes.  our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2012 was lower than our effective tax rate in the same period of 2011 due to this effect.  our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 could exceed 100% depending on the amount and geographic mix of our income before provision for income taxes. if our effective tax rate exceeds 100%, we would have a net loss even though our income before provision for income taxes was positive for any period in which that occurs. if the federal tax credit for research and development activities is reinstated during the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 will be lower.our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit. these losses were primarily due to the initial start-up costs incurred by our foreign subsidiaries to operate in certain foreign markets, including the costs incurred by those subsidiaries to license, develop, and use our intellectual property. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions.liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds and u.s. government and u.s. government agency securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $10.5 billion as of september 30, 2012, an increase of $6.5 billion from december 31, 2011. the most significant cash flow activities consisted of $6.8 billion of net proceeds from our ipo which was completed in may 2012, $931 million of cash generated from operations and $854 million in excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, offset by $1.0 billion used for capital expenditures and $911 million used for acquisition of businesses and other assets. we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.pre-2011 rsus vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition. the liquidity condition will be satisfied in november 2012. under settlement procedures applicable to these awards, we are permitted to deliver the underlying shares within 30 days before or after the date on which the liquidity condition is satisfied. we previously disclosed in our current report on form 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission on september 4, 2012 that we will vest and settle outstanding pre-2011 rsus for which the service condition has been satisfied and that are held by employees who were employed by us through october 15, 2012 on october 25, 2012 and such shares will be eligible for sale in the public markets as of market open on october 29, 2012. we will vest and settle outstanding pre-2011 rsus held by our non-employee directors and former employees on november 14, 2012. on the settlement dates, we plan to withhold and remit income taxes for certain rsu holders at applicable minimum statutory rates based on the closing price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable settlement date. we currently expect that the average of these withholding tax rates will be approximately 45%. if the price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable settlement date were equal to $21.66, the closing price of our class a common stock on september 30, 2012, we estimate that this tax obligation would be approximately $2.6 billion in the aggregate. the amount of this obligation could be higher or lower, depending on the closing price of our shares on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable settlement date. to settle these rsus, assuming an approximate 45% tax withholding rate, we anticipate that we will net settle the awards on october 25, 2012 by delivering an aggregate of approximately 121 million shares of class b common stock to rsu holders and withholding an aggregate of approximately 99 million shares of class b common stock, based on rsus outstanding as of september 30, 2012 for which the service condition will be satisfied as of october 15, 2012. in addition, we will also net settle on november 14, 2012 by delivering an aggregate of approximately 31 million shares of class b common stock not held by then-current employees as of october 15, 2012 and withholding an aggregate of approximately 20 million shares of class b common stock. in connection with these net settlements, we will withhold and remit the tax liabilities on behalf of the rsu holders in cash to the applicable tax authorities.in february 2012, we entered into an agreement for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $5 billion for general corporate purposes, with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at london interbank offered rate (libor) plus 1.0%. under the terms of the new agreement, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee of 0.10% per annum on the daily undrawn balance.concurrent with our entering into the new revolving credit facility, we also entered into a bridge credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to $3 billion to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of rsus in connection 30table of contentswith our ipo. no amounts were drawn down under these credit and bridge credit facility agreements as of september 30, 2012.in october 2012, we amended and restated our existing bridge credit facility, converting it to an unsecured term loan facility (the amended and restated term loan) that allows us to borrow up to $1.5 billion to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of rsus in connection with our ipo, with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%. we paid origination fees at closing of the amended and restated term loan, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. we are also obligated to pay an additional upfront fee of 0.15% of the aggregate amount of the borrowings requested on any applicable funding date, which would be amortized over the remaining term of the facility, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we may make up to two borrowings under the amended and restated term loan prior to november 20, 2012. any amounts outstanding under this facility will become due and payable upon the third anniversary date of the initial borrowing. as we previously disclosed in our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on october 15, 2012, we currently expect to use borrowings under the amended and restated term loan to cover approximately half of the withholding tax liability that will arise when approximately 271 million rsus vest and settle in october and november 2012, and that the average of the withholding tax rates will be approximately 45%. as of september 30, 2012, $570 million of the $10.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided for the additional taxes that would be due if we repatriated these funds for use in our operations in the united states.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense of $1.4 billion and total depreciation and amortization, partially offset by income tax refundable and deferred income taxes. the decrease in cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was mainly due to $11 million of net loss incurred in 2012 compared to $698 million of net income generated in 2011, decreased deferred income taxes and increased income tax refundable, partially offset by increases in adjustments for non-cash items as described above.cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2012 primarily resulted from $5.6 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities, $1.0 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers as well as $911 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents. the increase in cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities, acquisitions of businesses and other assets and capital expenditures.we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2012 of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, a portion of which we will finance through leasing arrangements. cash provided by financing activitiesin may 2012, we received $6.8 billion in proceeds from our ipo, net of offering costs. our financing activities have primarily consisted of equity issuances, lease financing, and debt financing. net cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 billion and $1.1 billion, for the first nine months of 2012 and 2011, respectively, and included excess tax benefits from stock award activities of $854 million and $405 million for the same periods, respectively. in the first nine months of 2011, it also included $250 million of debt repayment. we had no outstanding debt during the same period in 2012.off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of september 30, 2012.contractual obligationsthere were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our prospectus.contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe both that it is probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant 31table of contentsjudgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 7 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and “legal proceedings” contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncementscomprehensive incomein may 2011, the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that changed the requirement for presenting “comprehensive income” in the consolidated financial statements. the update requires an entity to present the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. the update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. we adopted this new guidance on january 1, 2012.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our prospectus.32table of contentsitem 2.management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our prospectus filed pursuant to rule 424(b) under the securities act of 1933, as amended, with the securities and exchange commission on may 18, 2012 (prospectus). in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a. “risk factors.” for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled “—limitations of key metrics.”overviewour mission is to make the world more open and connected. facebook enables you to express yourself and connect with the world around you instantly and freely.we build products that support our mission by creating utility for users, developers, and advertisers:users. we enable people who use facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.developers. we enable developers to use the facebook platform to build applications (apps) and websites that integrate with facebook to reach our global network of users and to build products that are more personalized, social, and engaging.advertisers. we enable advertisers to engage with more than one billion monthly active users (maus) on facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. we offer advertisers a unique combination of reach, relevance, social context, and engagement to enhance the value of their ads.we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers. in the third quarter of 2012, we recorded revenue of $1,262 million, income from operations of $377 million and net loss of $59 million. in the first nine months of 2012, we recorded revenue of $3,504 million, income from operations of $15 million and net loss of $11 million. total costs and expenses grew more than revenue, due to increased headcount and significant increases in share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses for restricted stock units (rsus) during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012. during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, we recognized $148 million and $1,510 million, respectively, of share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses. of these amounts, $1,098 million was due to the recognition of share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses related to rsus granted prior to january 1, 2011 (pre-2011 rsus) triggered by the completion of our initial public offering (ipo) in may 2012. for the third quarter of 2012, we incurred a net loss despite generating income before provision for income taxes due to our effective tax rate exceeding 100%. our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit.19table of contentstrends in our user metrics•monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website that is integrated with facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community, which has grown substantially in the past several years.     note: for purposes of reporting maus, daus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey, asia includes all users in australia and new zealand, and rest of world includes africa, latin america, and the middle east. in june 2012, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the first quarter of 2012. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide mau number, it did affect our attribution of users to different geographic regions. the first quarter of 2012 user metrics reflect the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region.as of september 30, 2012, we had 1.01 billion maus, an increase of 26% from september 30, 2011. users in brazil, india, and japan represented key sources of growth in the third quarter of 2012 relative to the prior year. we had 61 million maus in brazil as of september 30, 2012, an increase of 109% compared to the same period in 2011; we had 65 million maus in india as of september 30, 2012, an increase of 62% compared to the same period in 2011; and we had 18 million maus in japan as of september 30, 2012, an increase of 218% compared to the same period in 2011. additionally, we had 171 million maus in the united states as of september 30, 2012, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2011. 20table of contents•daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her facebook friends or connections via a third-party website that is integrated with facebook, on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement. note: for non-worldwide dau user numbers presented for the periods marked march 31, 2012 and june 30, 2012, the figures represent an average of the first 25 days of the period and the last 27 days of the period, respectively, in order to avoid using data subject to the algorithm error described in the mau section above. these average numbers do not meaningfully differ from the average numbers when calculated over a full month.worldwide daus increased 28% to 584 million on average during september 2012 from 457 million during september 2011. we experienced growth in daus across major markets including brazil, india and japan. overall growth in daus was driven largely by increased mobile usage of facebook. relative to june 30, 2012, daus increased from 552 million to 584 million, primarily due to an increase in mobile users. during the third quarter of 2012, the number of daus using personal computers increased modestly compared to the second quarter of 2012, but in certain key markets such as the united states and europe the number of daus using personal computers was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter after having decreased modestly during the second quarter of 2012.21table of contents•mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile app or via mobile-optimized versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet such as the ipad, during the period of measurement. worldwide mobile maus increased by 61% from 376 million as of september 30, 2011 to 604 million as of september 30, 2012. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus are accessing facebook through mobile devices, with users in india, brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile growth over this period. approximately 126 million mobile maus accessed facebook solely through mobile apps or our mobile website during the month ended september 30, 2012, increasing 24% from 102 million during the month ended june 30, 2012. the remaining 478 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during that month. while most of our mobile users also access facebook through personal computers, we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will exceed the growth in usage through personal computers for the foreseeable future and that the usage through personal computers may be flat or continue to decline in certain markets, including key developed markets such as the united states, in part due to our focus on developing mobile products to encourage mobile usage of facebook.the number of maus, daus and mobile maus discussed above do not include instagram users unless such users would otherwise qualify as maus, daus and mobile maus, respectively, based on activity that is shared back to facebook.22table of contents trends in our monetization by user geographywe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual goods are purchased. we define average revenue per user (arpu) as our total revenue in a given geography during a given period, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the period. our revenue and arpu in markets such as the united states, canada, and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to advertisers and users.   note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the advertiser or developer. in june 2012, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the first quarter of 2012. the first quarter of 2012 arpu amount for the united states & canada region reflects an adjustment based on the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region.23table of contentsduring the third quarter of 2012, worldwide arpu was $1.29, an increase of 4% from the third quarter of 2011. over this period, arpu increased by approximately 20% in the united states and canada and rest of world, and by 4% and 2% in asia and europe, respectively. arpu in europe declined compared to the second quarter of 2012 due primarily to a decline in payments and other fees revenue and advertising revenue being flat due, we believe, to seasonality traditionally experienced in the third quarter. user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.limitations of key metricsthe numbers of our maus and daus and arpu are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. for example, there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service, despite our efforts to detect and suppress such behavior. we estimate, for example, that “duplicate” accounts (an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account) may have represented approximately 4.8% of our worldwide maus as of june 30, 2012. we also seek to identify “false” accounts, which we divide into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) undesirable accounts, which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as spamming. as of june 30, 2012, for example, we estimate user-misclassified accounts may have represented approximately 2.4% of our worldwide maus and undesirable accounts may have represented approximately 1.5% of our worldwide maus. we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or australia and higher in developing markets such as indonesia and turkey. however, these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination, such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. as such, our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts. we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts, and such estimates may be affected by improvements or changes in our methodology.our metrics are also affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved, and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs. for example, we estimate that less than 5% of our estimated worldwide daus as of december 31, 2011 and 2010 resulted from this type of automatic mobile activity, and that this type of activity had a substantially smaller effect on our estimate of worldwide maus and mobile maus. the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varies by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world. in addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user’s ip address and self-disclosed location. these factors may not always accurately reflect the user’s actual location. for example, a mobile-only user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user’s actual location. the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. for example, in early june 2012, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the period ended march 31, 2012. while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide mau number, it did affect our attribution of users to different geographic regions. we estimate that the number of maus as of march 31, 2012 for the united states and canada region was overstated as a result of the error by approximately 3% and these overstatements were offset by understatements in other regions. in addition, our estimates for revenue by user location are also affected by these factors. we regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating these metrics to improve their accuracy. in addition, our mau and dau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology. for example, some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses.24table of contentscomponents of results of operationsrevenuewe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers.advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the facebook website or mobile app and third-party affiliated websites. advertisers pay for ad products which include sponsored stories in news feed, either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of clicks made by our users. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads or sponsored stories in the period in which a user clicks on the content. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads or sponsored stories in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad or sponsored story is displayed to users. an individual sponsored story in news feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day; however, in general, only the initial display of the sponsored story is considered an impression, regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the news feed.payments and other fees. we enable payments from our users to our platform developers. our users can transact and make payments on the facebook platform by using credit cards, paypal or other payment methods available on our website. we receive a fee from our platform developers when users make purchases from our platform developers using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our platform developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game apps on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. cumulatively to date, games from zynga have generated the majority of our payments and other fees revenue. however, zynga's contribution to our payments and other fees revenue has decreased over time and this trend may continue. our other fees revenue has been immaterial in recent periods. cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, developer-, and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures.general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. general and administrative expenses also include legal settlements.we have reclassified certain prior period expense amounts from marketing and sales to general and administrative within our condensed consolidated statements of operations to conform to our current period presentation. these reclassifications did not affect revenue, total costs and expenses, income from operations, or net (loss) income.25table of

respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2011. the increase was due primarily to a 36% and 33% increase in advertising revenue during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2011. in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of adverting revenue was 14% and 6%, respectively. as mobile advertising was not offered prior to the first quarter of 2012, comparisons to prior year are not meaningful. advertising revenue grew primarily due to a 27% increase in the number of ads delivered during both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 and to a lesser extent, due to a 7% and 5% increase in the average price per ad in those same periods.the increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth. maus grew 26% from september 30, 2011 to september 30, 2012 and average daus grew 28% from september 2011 to september 2012. various product changes and changes in user engagement generally offset in their impact on the average number of ads per user. for example, the shift to greater mobile use generally reduced ads per user, while the introduction of sponsored stories in news feed increased the number of ads per user. the rate of change in number of ads delivered also differs by geography, driven by factors such as mobile penetration. for example, europe and rest of world increased at a faster rate than the united states and asia. growth in the average price per ad for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in price per ad in the united states, which benefited from growth in sponsored stories in news feed across desktop and mobile devices during the second and third quarters of 2012. sponsored stories in news feed have a significantly higher average price per ad due to factors which include the prominent position of the sponsored stories. the increase in price per ad in the united states was partially offset by an increased percentage of our worldwide ads being delivered in the asia and rest of world geographies where the average price per ad, while growing on a year-over-year basis, is relatively lower. the average price per ad was also affected by a decline in the average price per ad in europe in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes and, in part, we believe, to continuing weak economic conditions in that region affecting advertiser demand.payments and other fees revenue in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012 increased to $176 million, or 13%, and $554 million, or 50%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2011. payments revenue declined compared to the second quarter of 2012, we believe due primarily to users migrating from better monetizing simulation game-types towards lower monetizing arcade and puzzle game-types, as well as a shift in gaming activity to mobile devices which do not use our payments product. facebook payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the facebook platform with limited exceptions on july 1, 2011. accordingly, comparisons of payments and other fees revenue to periods before this date may not be meaningful. our payments terms and conditions provide for a 30-day claim period subsequent to a payments transaction during which the customer may dispute the virtual or digital goods transaction. to date, we have deferred recognition of payments revenue until the expiration of this period as we were unable to make reasonable and reliable estimates of future refunds or chargebacks arising during this claim period, due to lack of historical transactional information. in the fourth quarter of 2012, we will have 24 months of historical transactional information which we currently anticipate will enable us to estimate future refunds and chargebacks. accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2012 we expect to record all payments revenues at the time of the purchase of the related virtual or digital goods, net of estimated refunds or chargebacks. we anticipate that this change will result in a one-time increase in payments revenue in the fourth quarter.seven percent and nine percent of our total revenue for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, respectively, and 12% of our total revenue for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2011, came from a single customer, zynga. revenue from zynga consisted of payments processing fees related to their sale of virtual goods and from direct advertising purchased by zynga. 27table of contentscost of

$51 million and $172 million increases in depreciation in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, respectively. share-based compensation expense increased by $73 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 mainly due to recognition of expense related to pre-2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and, to a lesser extent, rsus granted on or after january 1, 2011 (post-2011 rsus). increases in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 53% increase in employee headcount also contributed to increases in cost of revenue during the periods presented. these expenses supported our user growth, the increased usage of our products by users, developers, and advertisers, and the launch of new products.research and

and the first nine months of 2012, respectively, resulting primarily from recognition of expense related to post-2011 rsus for the third quarter of 2012 and pre-2011 rsus for the first nine months of 2012. payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 77% growth in employee headcount in engineering, design, product management, and other technical functions. this investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users, developers, and advertisers.marketing and sales  three months ended september 30,   nine months ended

compared to the same period in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 21% increase in employee headcount to support global sales, business development, and customer service, including a $15 million increase in share-based compensation expense. the increase in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was primarily due to $255 million increase in share-based compensation expense resulting from recognition of expense related to pre-2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and, to a lesser extent, post-2011 rsus. an increase in our user-, developer-, and advertiser-facing marketing expense also affected both periods presented.28table of contentsgeneral and administrative  three months ended

the increase in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense of $272 million in the first nine months of 2012 resulting from recognition of expense related to pre-2011 rsus and, to a lesser extent, post-2011 rsus. payroll and benefits expenses also increased for both periods presented due to a 49% increase in employee headcount in corporate

first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 were mostly due to lower foreign exchange losses in 2012 resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances and to a lesser extent, an increase in interest income driven by larger invested cash balances.income tax provision  three months ended september 30,   nine months ended

income taxes in the third quarter of 2012 increased by $279 million compared to the same period in 2011. the increase was primarily due to the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and the geographic mix of our income. our provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2012 decreased by $478 million compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to the loss before provision for income taxes.our effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 increased compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to the impact of certain non-deductible share-based compensation expense that was recognized during the period and additional losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit, and the expiration of the federal tax credit for research and development activities. the impact of these items on our effective tax rate is significantly greater when our income before provision for income taxes is lower. 29table of contentsour effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2012 was zero because the discrete tax items that arose during the first nine months of 2012 offset the income tax benefit that was based on applying our estimated annual effective tax rate to our loss before provision for income taxes.  our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2012 was lower than our effective tax rate in the same period of 2011 due to this effect.  our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 could exceed 100% depending on the amount and geographic mix of our income before provision for income taxes. if our effective tax rate exceeds 100%, we would have a net loss even though our income before provision for income taxes was positive for any period in which that occurs. if the federal tax credit for research and development activities is reinstated during the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 will be lower.our effective tax rate has exceeded the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit. these losses were primarily due to the initial start-up costs incurred by our foreign subsidiaries to operate in certain foreign markets, including the costs incurred by those subsidiaries to license, develop, and use our intellectual property. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions.liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds and u.s. government and u.s. government agency securities. cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $10.5 billion as of september 30, 2012, an increase of $6.5 billion from december 31, 2011. the most significant cash flow activities consisted of $6.8 billion of net proceeds from our ipo which was completed in may 2012, $931 million of cash generated from operations and $854 million in excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, offset by $1.0 billion used for capital expenditures and $911 million used for acquisition of businesses and other assets. we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.pre-2011 rsus vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition. the liquidity condition will be satisfied in november 2012. under settlement procedures applicable to these awards, we are permitted to deliver the underlying shares within 30 days before or after the date on which the liquidity condition is satisfied. we previously disclosed in our current report on form 8-k filed with the securities and exchange commission on september 4, 2012 that we will vest and settle outstanding pre-2011 rsus for which the service condition has been satisfied and that are held by employees who were employed by us through october 15, 2012 on october 25, 2012 and such shares will be eligible for sale in the public markets as of market open on october 29, 2012. we will vest and settle outstanding pre-2011 rsus held by our non-employee directors and former employees on november 14, 2012. on the settlement dates, we plan to withhold and remit income taxes for certain rsu holders at applicable minimum statutory rates based on the closing price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable settlement date. we currently expect that the average of these withholding tax rates will be approximately 45%. if the price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable settlement date were equal to $21.66, the closing price of our class a common stock on september 30, 2012, we estimate that this tax obligation would be approximately $2.6 billion in the aggregate. the amount of this obligation could be higher or lower, depending on the closing price of our shares on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable settlement date. to settle these rsus, assuming an approximate 45% tax withholding rate, we anticipate that we will net settle the awards on october 25, 2012 by delivering an aggregate of approximately 121 million shares of class b common stock to rsu holders and withholding an aggregate of approximately 99 million shares of class b common stock, based on rsus outstanding as of september 30, 2012 for which the service condition will be satisfied as of october 15, 2012. in addition, we will also net settle on november 14, 2012 by delivering an aggregate of approximately 31 million shares of class b common stock not held by then-current employees as of october 15, 2012 and withholding an aggregate of approximately 20 million shares of class b common stock. in connection with these net settlements, we will withhold and remit the tax liabilities on behalf of the rsu holders in cash to the applicable tax authorities.in february 2012, we entered into an agreement for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $5 billion for general corporate purposes, with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at london interbank offered rate (libor) plus 1.0%. under the terms of the new agreement, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee of 0.10% per annum on the daily undrawn balance.concurrent with our entering into the new revolving credit facility, we also entered into a bridge credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to $3 billion to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of rsus in connection 30table of contentswith our ipo. no amounts were drawn down under these credit and bridge credit facility agreements as of september 30, 2012.in october 2012, we amended and restated our existing bridge credit facility, converting it to an unsecured term loan facility (the amended and restated term loan) that allows us to borrow up to $1.5 billion to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of rsus in connection with our ipo, with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%. we paid origination fees at closing of the amended and restated term loan, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. we are also obligated to pay an additional upfront fee of 0.15% of the aggregate amount of the borrowings requested on any applicable funding date, which would be amortized over the remaining term of the facility, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we may make up to two borrowings under the amended and restated term loan prior to november 20, 2012. any amounts outstanding under this facility will become due and payable upon the third anniversary date of the initial borrowing. as we previously disclosed in our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on october 15, 2012, we currently expect to use borrowings under the amended and restated term loan to cover approximately half of the withholding tax liability that will arise when approximately 271 million rsus vest and settle in october and november 2012, and that the average of the withholding tax rates will be approximately 45%. as of september 30, 2012, $570 million of the $10.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we have provided for the additional taxes that would be due if we repatriated these funds for use in our operations in the united states.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense of $1.4 billion and total depreciation and amortization, partially offset by income tax refundable and deferred income taxes. the decrease in cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was mainly due to $11 million of net loss incurred in 2012 compared to $698 million of net income generated in 2011, decreased deferred income taxes and increased income tax refundable, partially offset by increases in adjustments for non-cash items as described above.cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2012 primarily resulted from $5.6 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities, $1.0 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers as well as $911 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents. the increase in cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities, acquisitions of businesses and other assets and capital expenditures.we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2012 of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, a portion of which we will finance through leasing arrangements. cash provided by financing activitiesin may 2012, we received $6.8 billion in proceeds from our ipo, net of offering costs. our financing activities have primarily consisted of equity issuances, lease financing, and debt financing. net cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 billion and $1.1 billion, for the first nine months of 2012 and 2011, respectively, and included excess tax benefits from stock award activities of $854 million and $405 million for the same periods, respectively. in the first nine months of 2011, it also included $250 million of debt repayment. we had no outstanding debt during the same period in 2012.off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of september 30, 2012.contractual obligationsthere were no material changes in our commitments under contractual obligations, as disclosed in our prospectus.contingencieswe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe both that it is probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant 31table of contentsjudgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 7 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 and “legal proceedings” contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncementscomprehensive incomein may 2011, the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that changed the requirement for presenting “comprehensive income” in the consolidated financial statements. the update requires an entity to present the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. the update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. we adopted this new guidance on january 1, 2012.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes and share-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our prospectus.32table of contents
