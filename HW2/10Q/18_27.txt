and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any
statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth
and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are
forward-looking statements. such statements are based on our current expectations and could be
affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in
the “business outlook” section (see also “risk factors” in part ii, item 1a of this form 10-q). our
actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the
potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that
had not been completed as of november 2, 2009.

overview

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital economy. our primary component-level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash
memory. net revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), and net income (loss) for the second
and third quarters of 2009 and the third quarter of 2008 were as follows:

we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter with revenue up 17% and our gross margin
percentage up 7 points from the second quarter. better than expected demand for microprocessors and
chipsets led to the largest third quarter sequential revenue increase in over 30 years. we saw
growth in all geographies as the recovering global economy was led by consumer demand and continued
replenishment of supply chain inventory. microprocessors and chipsets designed for notebooks
outpaced the unit growth of our
intel®
atom™ processors and chipsets. microprocessors and
chipsets designed for notebooks were one of the primary drivers of our revenue growth in the third
quarter and we expect that to continue in the future. the average selling prices for
microprocessors declined slightly compared to the second quarter of 2009, as the mix of
microprocessors sold in this consumer driven recovery have a lower average selling price than the
microprocessors traditionally sold to businesses. compared to the third quarter of 2008 revenue was
down 8%, an improvement from 15% and 26% year over year declines in the second and first quarters
of 2009 respectively. we expect that revenue in the fourth quarter will increase from the third
quarter in line with seasonal patterns. our inventories are down $1.3 billion from year end 2008;
however, we do not expect shortages that would impact our revenue outlook.

our gross margin percentage for the third quarter compared to the second quarter was positively
impacted by higher microprocessor sales volume, lower microprocessor unit costs, lower factory
underutilization charges, and lower startup costs as we transition into production using our 32nm
process technology. these improvements to our gross margin percentage were partially offset by
inventory write-offs of our new 32nm microprocessor products that were not yet qualified for sale.
as we move into the fourth quarter we expect our gross margin percentage to increase further as
32nm products built in the fourth quarter are qualified for sale. in addition, our gross margin
percentage is expected to increase due to higher microprocessor sales volume and lower factory
underutilization charges on increased production.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
our strong third quarter financial results emphasizes that we have the right product offerings in
the marketplace at the right cost. in the third quarter we began volume production using our new
32nm processor technology that features our 2nd generation hi-k metal gate transistors.
this process technology will allow us to improve upon our microprocessor portfolio by offering
products with increased performance and lower power consumption that cost less to produce. the 32nm
process technology will also allow us to significantly expand our system on chip products offerings
which we believe will help us succeed in our key growth areas.
from a financial condition perspective, we ended the third quarter of 2009 with a high credit
quality investment portfolio of $12.9 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, debt
instruments included in trading assets, and short term investments. during the third quarter of
2009 we generated $4.0 billion in cash from operations despite paying the €1.06 billion ($1.447
billion) european commission fine recorded in the second quarter of 2009. during the third quarter
we issued $2.0 billion of convertible debt and utilized the
proceeds from the convertible debt to
repurchase $1.7 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. in addition,
during the third quarter we completed the purchase of wind river
systems, inc., returned $771 million to
shareholders through dividends, and paid $944 million for capital assets. we continue to make
significant investment in capital assets to meet our strategic objectives, however, based on
capital reuse and efficiencies, we now estimate that total capital expenditures in 2009 will be
less than depreciation incurred in 2009. in september, our board of directors declared a dividend
of $0.14 per common share to be paid in december.
finally, in september we announced a broad reorganization to better align our business around the
core competencies of intel architecture and our manufacturing operations. we are currently in the
process of making these changes to our organization and our systems.
strategy
our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide
digital and internet connected economy. as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant
market segment, we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits,
as well as our financial resources, global presence, and brand recognition. we believe that we have
the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs
quickly.
some of our key focus areas are listed below:



 
•
 
customer orientation. our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of
products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. in turn, our products help
enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and
consumers. we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured
to work together to provide an optimized user computing solution, compared to components
that are used separately.


 
•
 
architecture and platforms. we are developing integrated platform solutions by
moving the memory controller and graphics functionality from the chipset to the
microprocessor. this platform repartitioning is designed to provide improved performance
due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and reduced platform size. in addition,
we are focusing on improved energy-efficient performance for computing and communications
systems and devices. improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing improved
performance with lower power consumption. we continue to develop multi-core microprocessors
with an increasing number of cores, which can enable improved multitasking and energy
efficient performance by distributing computing tasks across multiple cores.


 
•
 
silicon and manufacturing technology leadership. our strategy for developing
microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new
microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. we plan to introduce a
new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon
process technology in the intervening years. this coordinated schedule allows us to develop
and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for
the next generation of silicon process technology. we refer to this as our “tick-tock”
technology development cadence.


 
•
 
strategic investments. we make equity investments in companies around the world
that we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and
support our key business initiatives. our investments, including those made through our
intel capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to
stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for intel, and
expand global markets for our products. our current investments primarily focus on the
following areas: advancing flash memory products, enabling mobile wireless devices,
advancing the digital home, enhancing the digital enterprise, advancing high-performance
communications infrastructures, and developing the next generation of silicon process
technologies. our focus areas and investment activities tend to develop and change over
time due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in the economic climate.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)




 
•
 
business environment and software. we believe that we are well positioned in the
technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote industry
standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. we plan to continue
to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer products that take
advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. we frequently participate in industry
initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of
technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations. in
addition, we work collaboratively with other companies to protect digital content and the
consumer. through our software and services group (ssg), we help enable and advance the
computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers
create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms.
through our wind river software group, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2009, we
license software products and provide services that are optimized for the needs of customers
in the embedded and handheld market segments. we believe that the expertise of our wind river
software group in the embedded and handheld market segments will expedite our growth strategy
in these market segments.



we believe that the proliferation of the internet, including user demand for premium content and
rich media, drives the need for greater performance in pcs and servers. older pcs are increasingly
incapable of handling the tasks that users demand, such as streaming video, uploading photos, and
online gaming. as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power, we
believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet. we
also believe that increased internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing, where a
group of linked servers provide a variety of applications and data to users over the internet,
create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for
energy-efficient performance and virtualization.

in september 2009, we announced a broad reorganization to better align our business around the core
competencies of intel architecture and our manufacturing operations. we are currently in the
process of making these changes to our organization and our systems. given the scope and size of
the business lines being impacted, this reorganization is expected to be in effect and
reported in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 26, 2009. under the new
operating structure, our reportable operating segments will include the pc client group and data
center group. the pc client group will include our mobile and desktop products and the data center
group will include our server and workstation products.

we believe the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop
microprocessor units will continue. we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will
result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power
microprocessors. we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to
that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers, as a growing number of
households have multiple devices for different computing functions. our silicon and manufacturing
technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses
and form factors. we believe that intel atom processors give us
the ability to extend intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including a
growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded devices,
handhelds, consumer electronics devices, nettops, and netbooks. we also believe that our intel
atom developer program, which we expect to spur new applications that run on products using intel
atom processors, will expedite our growth strategy in these new market segments. we believe that
the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the
ability to access the internet.

to meet the demands of new and evolving mobile, consumer electronics, and various embedded market
segments, we also offer, and are continuing to develop, system on chip (soc) products that
integrate the core processing functionality of our intel atom processors with specific components,
such as graphics, audio, and video, onto a single chip. this integration reduces cost, power
consumption, and size. we are collaborating with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, ltd.
(tsmc), a large semiconductor foundry, in an effort to broaden the market opportunities for intel
atom processors in soc products by integrating our intel atom processor cores with tsmc’s process
technology platform.

we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many-core architecture aimed at
parallel processing, the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task. this
architecture will initially be used in developing discrete graphics processors designed for gaming
and media creation. over time, this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for
scientific and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

critical accounting estimates

the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a
significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. some of our
accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the
need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical
accounting estimates include:




 
•
 
the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments,
net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments;


 
•
 
the valuation of investments in debt instruments and the determination of
other-than-temporary impairments, which impact our investment portfolio balance when we
assess fair value, and interest and other, net when we record other-than-temporary
impairments of available-for-sale debt instruments within earnings;


 
•
 
the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which primarily impacts
gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their
depreciation;


 
•
 
the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including
the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and


 
•
 
the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin.



below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. we also
have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as those for revenue
recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors; however, these policies
typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.

non-marketable equity investments

the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives,
totaled $3.5 billion as of september 26, 2009 ($4.1 billion as of december 27, 2008). the majority
of this balance as of september 26, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market
segment. our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash
technologies, llc (imft) of $1.4 billion ($1.7 billion as of december 27, 2008), our investment in
im flash singapore, llp (imfs) of $305 million ($329 million as of december 27, 2008), and our
investment in numonyx b.v. of $438 million ($484 million as of december 27, 2008). in addition, we
regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from
early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature
companies with established revenue streams and business models. for additional information, see
“note 10: equity method investments” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of
this form 10-q.

our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method
of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. our non-marketable
equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated condensed balance
sheets.

non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of the companies in which we
invest are likely to fail. their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance,
operational efficiency, and other key business factors. depending on their future prospects, the
companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive
lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our
investments would likely become impaired. additionally, financial markets and credit markets are
volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability
to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our
investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales.
for further information about our investment portfolio risks, see “risk factors” in part ii,
item 1a of this form 10-q.

we measure the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure
purposes; however, the investments are only recorded at fair value when an impairment charge is
recognized. for non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires
significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of events or circumstances
identified that impact the fair value of the investment, including:




 
•
 
the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones
and overall business prospects;


 
•
 
the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;


 
•
 
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area,
including adverse regulatory or economic changes;


 
•
 
factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the
investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash;
and


 
•
 
the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.



39



 




management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is
other than temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes
assessing the severity and duration of the impairment. if the investment is considered to be other
than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. with the exception of
clearwire communications, llc (clearwire llc), the fair value of our non-marketable investments are
classified as level 3 when impaired, as we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology
that are significant to the fair value measurement, and the valuation requires management judgment
due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. if impaired, the fair
value of our investment in clearwire llc would be classified as level 2, as the unobservable inputs
to the valuation methodology would not be significant to the fair value measurement.

impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $50 million in the third quarter of 2009
($168 million in the first nine months of 2009). over the past 12 quarters, including the third
quarter of 2009, impairments of non-marketable equity investments have ranged from $11 million to
$896 million per quarter. this range includes impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter
of 2008, which were primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in
clearwire llc.

the following is a discussion of the methods, estimates, and judgments that management uses in our
analysis to determine if our non-marketable equity investments are other than temporarily impaired.

imft/imfs

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand
products to intel and micron technology, inc. at manufacturing cost. our nand solutions group
operating segment purchases 49% of these nand products from imft and sells them to our
customers. as a result, we generate cash flows from these investments and our intangible assets
related to the nand product designs through our nand solutions group business. therefore, we
determine the fair value of our investments in imft and imfs using the income approach, based on a
weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business.

the discounted cash flow scenarios require the use of unobservable inputs, including assumptions of
projected revenues (based on expectations for product volume, product mix, and average selling
prices), expenses, capital spending, and other costs, as well as a discount rate. estimates of
projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by imft, imfs, and
intel using historical data and available market data. management also determines how multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios are weighted in the fair value determination. additionally, the
development of several inputs used in our income model (such as discount rate) requires the
selection of comparable companies within the nand flash memory market segment. the selection of
comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including
nand products and services lines within the flash memory market segment, comparable companies’
sizes, growth rates, and other relevant factors.

changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs would change the fair value of the
investments. the estimates for  projected revenue and discount rate are the assumptions that most
significantly affect the fair value determination. we did not have an other-than-temporary
impairment on our investments in imft and imfs in the first nine months of 2009 or the first nine
months of 2008. it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination
could change in the near term and result in an impairment of our
investments.

numonyx

we determine the fair value of our investment in numonyx using a combination of the income approach
and the market approach. the income approach includes the use of a weighted average of multiple
discounted cash flow scenarios of numonyx, which requires the use of unobservable inputs, including
assumptions of projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs, as well as a
discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment comparable to
our investment in numonyx. estimates of projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other
costs are developed by numonyx and intel. the market approach includes using financial metrics and
ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable
performance multiples. the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach requires
management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including nor products and services lines
within the flash memory market segment, comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, and other
relevant factors.

40



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs in our valuation models would change the
fair value of the investment. the estimated projected revenue is the assumption that most
significantly affects the fair value determination. management judgment is also involved in
determining how the income approach and the market approach are weighted in the fair value
determination. we did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in numonyx in
the first nine months of 2009. we recorded a $250 million impairment charge on our investment in
numonyx during the third quarter of 2008 to write down our investment to its fair value. estimates
for revenue, earnings, and future cash flows were revised lower due to a general decline in the nor
flash memory market segment. it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value
determination could change in the near term and result in an
additional impairment of our investment.

other non-marketable equity investments

we determine the fair value of these non-marketable equity investments using the market approach
and/or the income approach. the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of
comparable public companies. the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and
is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries,
development stages, and other relevant factors. the income approach includes the use of a
discounted cash flow model, which requires the following significant estimates for the investee:
revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; estimated costs;
and appropriate discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. estimates of
market segment size, market segment share, and costs are developed by the investee and/or intel
using historical data and available market data. the valuation of our other non-marketable
investments also takes into account movements of the public equity and venture capital markets,
recent financing activities by the investees, changes in the interest rate environment, the
investee’s capital structure, differences in seniority and preferences for instruments issued by
investees, and other economic variables.

investments in debt instruments

fair value

the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective. changes
occurring in financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in
relatively short periods of time. there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair
value (see “note 4: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements of this
form 10-q). each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in
determining fair value.

level 1 instruments represent quoted prices in active markets. therefore, determining fair value
for level 1 instruments does not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not
difficult.

level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for
identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active
markets), issuer credit ratings, non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with
observable market data, model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or
can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities, or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. these
level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level 1
instruments, including:




 
•
 
determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced requires
management to identify a sample of similar securities based on the coupon rates, maturity,
issuer, credit rating, and instrument type, and subjectively select an individual security
or multiple securities that are deemed most similar to the security being priced.


 

 
•
 
determining whether a market is considered active requires management judgment. our
assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into
consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date
of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument
trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of
the issued instrument.


 

 
•
 
determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining fair value requires
management judgment. when observable market prices for identical securities or similar
securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding
market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data or pricing
models, such as discounted cash flow models, with all significant inputs derived from or
corroborated with observable market data.



41



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant
to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. the determination of fair value for
level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. most of our marketable
debt instruments classified as level 3 are valued using a non-binding market consensus price or a
non-binding broker quote, both of which we corroborate with unobservable data. non-binding market
consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers.
these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker
quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and the internal
assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs, and to a lesser
degree non-observable market inputs. adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using
non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes, and classified as level 3, were
not significant in the third quarter of 2009.

other-than-temporary impairment

after determining the fair value of our available-for-sale debt instruments, gains or losses on
these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss), until either the investment is
sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. determining whether the
decline in fair value is other-than-temporary requires management judgment based on the specific
facts and circumstances of each investment. for investments in debt instruments, these judgments
primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer, the issuer’s credit rating,
and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and
be paid in full; if we have the intent to sell the investment; and if it is more likely than not
that we will be required to sell an investment that has unrealized losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income before we recover the amortized cost basis. given changing market conditions,
we may recognize other-than-temporary impairments on these investments in the future.

for available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and
that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of our amortized
cost basis, we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the
amount due to all other factors. the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the
difference between the debt instrument’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected
future cash flows. the remaining difference between the debt instrument’s fair value and the
present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is
recognized in other comprehensive income.

as of september 26, 2009, our investments included $12.2 billion of available-for-sale debt
instruments. we have recognized less than $55 million of credit-related other-than-temporary
impairment losses in earnings on our available-for-sale debt instruments cumulatively since the
beginning of 2008. as of september 26, 2009, our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt
instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $90 million (approximately $215
million as of december 27, 2008). as of september 26, 2009, this amount included approximately $35
million of unrecognized losses that could be recognized in the future.

long-lived assets

we assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. factors that we
consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of
a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic
trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. we measure the
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying
value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash
flows. if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted
cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is measured by
comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. fair value
is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and
property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are recorded at fair value
only when an impairment charge is recognized.

impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of
identifiable independent cash flows. due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of
our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the
independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. in addition, as we make
manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective
judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor
manufacturing tools and building improvements. when we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the
assets’ new, shorter useful lives. over the past 12 quarters, including the third quarter of 2009,
impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $40 million to $320
million per quarter. for further discussion on asset impairment charges, see “note 17:
restructuring and asset impairment charges” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

income taxes

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial
statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits,
benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise
from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial
statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision
in a subsequent period.

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery
is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we
will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated
condensed balance sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred
tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery
was not likely. changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments
could affect our future provision for taxes.

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step
process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we
determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step
requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to
estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we
reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors
including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively
settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $377
million as of september 26, 2009. it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized
tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. such a change in recognition or
measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax
provision. given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters
being examined, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of
gross unrecognized tax benefits. however, we can reasonably expect a minimum reduction of
approximately $200 million of our existing gross unrealized tax benefits upon settlement or
effective settlement with the various tax authorities, the closure of certain audits, and the lapse
of statute of limitations within the next 12 months.

inventory

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as
inventory that is not of saleable quality. the determination of obsolete or excess inventory
requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. the estimate of future demand is
compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. as of september 26, 2009, we had total work-in-process inventory of
$1,072 million and total finished goods inventory of $1,020 million. the demand forecast is
included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between
inventory valuation and build decisions. product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the
inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life
cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an
assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. if our demand forecast for
specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output
accordingly, or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately, we could be required to write off
inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. in order to determine what costs can be
included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and
assembly and test facilities. if the factory loadings are below normal capacity a portion of our
manufacturing overhead costs will not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore, will be
recognized as cost of sales in that period, which negatively impacts our gross margin.

accounting changes and recent accounting standards

for a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected
dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated condensed financial
statements, see “note 2: accounting changes” and “note 3: recent accounting standards” in the notes

our net revenue for q3 2009 decreased 8% compared to q3 2008. the majority of our microprocessor
and chipset products had unit sale decreases compared to q3 2008. however, with the ramp of intel
atom processors and chipsets, overall microprocessor and chipset units were flat. average selling
prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased compared to q3 2008 primarily due to the ramp of
intel atom processors and chipsets, which generally have lower average selling prices than our
other microprocessor and chipset products. in addition, a decrease in average selling prices for
microprocessors within the mobility group operating segment was partially offset by an increase in
average selling prices for enterprise microprocessors within the digital enterprise group operating
segment. declines in revenue from the sale of communication products, primarily as a result of
prior divestitures, and from the sale of wireless connectivity products were offset by an increase
in revenue from the sale of nand flash memory products.
revenue in the europe, japan, and americas regions decreased by 29%, 13%, and 3%, respectively
compared to q3 2008, while revenue in the asia-pacific region was flat compared to q3 2008.
our overall gross margin dollars for q3 2009 decreased $615 million, or 10%, compared to q3 2008.
our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 57.6% in q3 2009, from 58.9% in q3 2008. the
decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage
decrease in the mobility group operating segment. this was partially offset by the gross margin
percentage increase in the nand solutions group operating segment. we derived the substantial
majority of our overall gross margin dollars in q3 2009 and most of our overall gross margin
dollars in q3 2008 from the sales of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility
group operating segments. see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased by $405 million, or 8%, in q3 2009 compared to
q3 2008. microprocessors within deg include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise
computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors. the decrease in microprocessor
revenue was primarily due to lower unit sales. higher enterprise average selling prices were
partially offset by lower desktop average selling prices. the decrease in chipset, motherboard, and
other revenue was due to lower chipset average selling prices, lower revenue from the sale of
communications products, and to a lesser extent, lower motherboard unit sales.

operating income decreased by $254 million, or 14%, in q3 2009 compared to q3 2008. the decrease in
operating income was primarily due to lower revenue. in addition, during the third quarter of 2009
we recorded approximately $60 million of factory underutilization charges, primarily relating to
microprocessors.

mobility group

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group (mg) operating segment for q3 2009 and q3
2008 were as follows:

net revenue for the mg operating segment decreased by $550 million, or 12%, in q3 2009 compared to
q3 2008. the decrease in microprocessor revenue was due to lower microprocessor average selling
prices, partially offset by higher microprocessor unit sales. the increase in unit sales and a
significant portion of the decrease in average selling prices were due to the ramp of intel atom
processors. the decrease in chipset and other revenue was primarily due to lower revenue from the
sale of wireless connectivity products.

operating income decreased by $501 million, or 27%, in q3 2009 compared to q3 2008. the decrease
was primarily due to lower microprocessor revenue. in addition, inventory write-offs of our new
32nm microprocessor products not yet qualified for sale and approximately $70 million of factory
underutilization charges recorded during the third quarter of 2009 decreased our operating income.
these decreases were primarily offset by lower chipset unit costs and lower operating expenses.

research and development. r&d spending decreased slightly by $41 million, or 3%, in q3 2009
compared to q3 2008 primarily due to lower product development costs.

marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased
$95 million, or 7%, in q3 2009 compared to q3 2008. advertising expenses, including cooperative
advertising expenses, were lower in q3 2009 compared to q3 2008. this was partially offset by
expenses related to our wind river software group operating segment.

r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 29% of net revenue in q3
2009 (28% of net revenue in q3 2008).

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs. the increase of $11 million was due to
amortization of intangibles and costs related to the acquisition of wind river
completed in the third quarter of 2009. see “note 14: acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated
condensed financial statements of this form 10-q.

we recognized lower interest income in q3 2009 compared to q3 2008 due to lower interest rates. the
average interest rate earned during q3 2009 decreased by approximately 2.3 percentage points
compared to q3 2008. lower gains on divestitures (none in q3 2009 and $20 million in q3 2008) were
mostly offset by lower fair value losses on our trading assets.

the
effective tax rate for q3 2009  was positively impacted by a higher
percentage of our profits being derived from
lower-tax jurisdictions compared to q3 2008 and the u.s r&d income tax credit that was reinstated
in q4 2008. the q3 2009 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by adjustments for differences
between our finalized tax return and the provision recorded, and other adjustments to tax
provisions from prior years, which were partially offset by settlements and effective settlements
of various uncertain tax positions.

our net revenue for the first nine months of 2009 decreased 16% compared to the first nine months
of 2008. the majority of our microprocessor and chipset products had unit sale decreases compared
to the first nine months of 2008. however, the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets offset
the majority of the decrease in overall microprocessor and chipset units. in addition, average
selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased compared to the first nine months of 2008
due to the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets, which generally have lower average selling
prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products. revenue from the sale of nor flash
memory products and communication products declined approximately $660 million, primarily as a
result of the divestiture of these businesses. additionally, revenue from the sale of wireless
connectivity products declined.

revenue in the europe, japan, americas, and asia-pacific regions decreased by 32%, 20%, 15%, and
11%, respectively compared to the first nine months of 2008.

our overall gross margin dollars for the first nine months of 2009 decreased $3.8 billion, or 23%,
compared to the first nine months of 2008. our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 51.8%
in the first nine months of 2009, from 56.1% in the first nine months of 2008. the decrease in
gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the
mobility group and digital enterprise group operating segments. this was partially offset by the
gross margin percentage increase in the nand solutions group operating segment. we derived most of
our overall gross margin dollars in the first nine months of 2009 and 2008 from the sales of
microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments. see
“business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations.

the results for the first nine months of 2009 include a charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a
result of the fine imposed by the european commission (see “note 24: contingencies” in the notes to
consolidated condensed financial statements of this form 10-q). the charge is included as part of
marketing, general and administrative expense.

digital enterprise group

the revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group (deg) operating segment for the
first nine months of 2009 and the first nine months of 2008 were as follows:

net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased by $2.9 billion, or 18%, in the first nine
months of 2009 compared to the first nine months of 2008. microprocessors within deg include
microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as
embedded microprocessors. the decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower unit
sales. total average selling prices within the deg operating segment were flat as higher enterprise
average selling prices were offset by both lower desktop average selling prices and a lower mix of
enterprise microprocessor units. the decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to
lower chipset unit sales and average selling prices, and to a lesser extent, lower revenue from the
sale of communications products and lower motherboard unit sales.

operating income decreased by $2.1 billion, or 41%, in the first nine months of 2009 compared to
the first nine months of 2008. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the lower
revenue. in addition, during the first nine months of 2009 we recorded approximately $420 million
of factory underutilization charges.

mobility group

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group (mg) operating segment for the first nine
months of 2009 and the first nine months of 2008 were as follows:

net revenue for the mg operating segment decreased by $1.6 billion, or 13%, in the first nine
months of 2009 compared to the first nine months of 2008. the decrease in microprocessor revenue
was primarily due to lower microprocessor average selling prices, partially offset by higher
microprocessor unit sales. the increase in unit sales and a majority of the decrease in average
selling prices were due to the ramp of intel atom processors. the decrease in chipset and other
revenue was primarily due to lower unit sales of wireless
connectivity products, and to a lesser
extent, lower chipset average selling prices.

operating income decreased by $1.9 billion, or 43%, in the first nine months of 2009 compared to
the first nine months of 2008. the decrease was primarily due to lower microprocessor and chipset
revenue and approximately $710 million of factory underutilization charges recorded during the
first nine months of 2009. in addition, lower chipset and microprocessor unit costs were offset by
approximately $190 million of higher start-up costs as well as inventory write-offs of our new 32nm
microprocessor products not yet qualified for sale.

research and development. r&d spending decreased $356 million, or 8%, in the first nine months of
2009 compared to the first nine months of 2008. this decrease was primarily due to lower process
development costs as we transitioned from research and development to manufacturing using our 32nm
manufacturing process technology.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
marketing, general and administrative. marketing, general and administrative expenses increased
$1.0 billion, or 24%, in the first nine months of 2009 compared to the first nine months of 2008.
this increase was due to the q2 2009 charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine
imposed by the ec (see “note 24: contingencies” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q). this increase was partially offset by lower advertising expenses,
including cooperative advertising expenses.
r&d, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 38% of net revenue in the
first nine months of 2009 (29% of net revenue in the first nine months of 2008). the ec fine was 6%
of net revenue in the first nine months of 2009.

impairment charges by plan for the first nine months of 2009 and the first nine months of 2008:

we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit
arrangements, and facility-related or other exit activities. our outlook for the fourth quarter of
2009 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of $40 million.
2009 restructuring program
in the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing
and assembly and test operations. these plans include closing two assembly and test facilities in
malaysia, one facility in the philippines, and one facility in china; stopping production at a
200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication
facility in california. restructuring and asset impairment charges were as follows:

we recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment
charges. the remaining accrual as of september 26, 2009 was related to severance benefits that are
recorded within accrued compensation and benefits.
the net charges above include $205 million that relate to employee severance and benefit
arrangements for approximately 6,500 employees, of which 4,100 employees have left the company as
of september 26, 2009. most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing.
we estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings
of approximately $330 million. the substantial majority of these savings will be realized within
cost of sales.

2006 efficiency program
in the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan
designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. restructuring and asset

during q1 2008, we incurred $275 million in additional asset impairment charges related to assets
that we sold in q2 2008 in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business. we
determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable
that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs. the lower fair value was
primarily a result of a decline in the outlook for the flash memory market segment. we had
previously incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges in 2007 related to assets that we sold
in q2 2008 in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business. we determined the impairment
charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of
the divestiture.

we recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment
charges. the 2006 efficiency program is substantially complete as of september 26, 2009.
from q3 2006 through q3 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset
impairment charges related to this plan. these charges included a total of $686 million related to
employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 11,300 employees, of which
substantially all employees had left the company as of september 26, 2009. a substantial majority
of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and
marketing. the restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset
impairment charges.
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs. the increase of $12 million was due to
amortization of intangibles and costs related to the acquisition of wind river completed in the
third quarter of 2009. see “note 14: acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial
statements of this form 10-q.

we recognized lower impairment charges on our marketable equity securities in the first nine months

our non-marketable equity investments. we also recognized lower gains on sales in the first nine

we recognized lower interest income in the first nine months of 2009 compared to the first nine
months of 2008 as a result of lower interest rates and, to a lesser extent, lower average
investment balances. the average interest rate earned during the first nine months of 2009
decreased by approximately 2.4 percentage points compared to the first nine months of 2008. in
addition, lower gains on divestitures (none in the first nine months of 2009 and $59 million in the
first nine months of 2008) were more than offset by approximately $55 million of fair value gains
in the first nine months of 2009 on our trading assets, compared to approximately $45 million of
fair value losses in the first nine months of 2008.

provision for taxes

based on our analysis, the ec fine (recorded in q2 2009) is not tax deductible. the ec fine of
$1.447 billion, with no associated reduction in the provision
for taxes, significantly increased our
effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2009. the impact of the ec fine was partially offset
by a higher percentage of our profits being derived from lower-tax jurisdictions compared to the
first nine months of 2008 and the u.s r&d income tax credit that was reinstated in q4 2008. in
addition, the effective tax rate was also positively impacted by settlements and effective
settlements of various uncertain tax positions, partially offset by adjustments for differences
between our finalized tax return and the provision recorded, and other adjustments to tax
provisions from prior years.

status of business outlook

we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with
investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking
statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10-q, including
any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. at the same time, we will
keep this form 10-q and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor
relations web site at www.intc.com. the public can continue to rely on the business outlook
published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we
publish a notice stating otherwise. the statements in the “business outlook” and other
forward-looking statements in this form 10-q are subject to revision during the course of the year
in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times.

from the close of business on november 25, 2009 until our quarterly earnings release is published,
presently scheduled for january 14, 2010, we will observe a “quiet period.” during the quiet
period, the “business outlook” and other forward-looking statements first published in our form 8-k
filed on october 13, 2009, as reiterated or updated as applicable, in this form 10-q, should be
considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update.
during the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our
financial results or expectations. the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and
any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.

compared to the first nine months of 2008, primarily due to lower net income, partially offset by
changes in our working capital. income taxes paid, net of refunds in the first nine months of 2009
compared to the first nine months of 2008 were $2.9 billion lower on lower income before taxes in
2009 and timing of payments. in addition, other changes in our working capital as of september 26,
2009 compared to december 27, 2008 were as follows:




 
•
 
inventories decreased due to lower chipset, microprocessor, and raw materials inventory.


 

 
•
 
accounts payable decreased due to lower production spending.


 

 
•
 
accounts receivable increased due to a higher proportion of sales at the end of the
third quarter of 2009.


 

 
•
 
other accrued liabilities included $62 million in customer credit balances as of
september 26, 2009 ($447 million as of december 27, 2008).                 



for the first nine months of 2009, our two largest customers accounted for 39% of net revenue (38%
for the first nine months of 2008) with one of those customers accounting for 21% of our net
revenue, and another customer accounting for 18% of our net revenue. these two largest customers
accounted for 33% of net accounts receivable at september 26, 2009 (46% at december 27, 2008).

investing activities

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases,
maturities, disposals, and cash used for acquisitions.

the
increase in cash used for investing activities in the first nine
months of 2009 compared to the
first nine months of 2008 was driven primarily by a decrease in maturities and sales of
available-for-sale investments and higher cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by an
increase in maturities and sales of trading assets.

financing activities

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock, payment of
dividends to stockholders, issuance of long-term debt, and proceeds from sales of shares through
employee equity incentive plans.

the decrease in cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2009, compared to
the first nine months of 2008, was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of
common stock and the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of
shares through employee equity incentive plans.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(continued)

we used the majority of the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt to repurchase and retire
common stock. during the first nine months of 2009 we repurchased 88.2 million shares at a cost of
$1.7 billion (324.1 million shares at a cost of $7.1 billion during the first nine months of 2008)
as part of our common stock repurchase program. as of september 26, 2009, $5.7 billion remained
available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. we base our
level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. our
dividend payments totaled $2.3 billion for the first nine months of 2009, flat compared to the
first nine months of 2008. proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive
plans totaled $367 million for the first nine months of 2009 compared to $1.1 billion for the first
nine months of 2008, as a result of significantly lower volume of employee exercises of stock
options.

liquidity

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. as of september 26, 2009,
cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments
totaled $12.9 billion.

our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities at the time of investment
of up to 6 months to be rated at least a-1/p-1 by standard & poor’s/moody’s, and specifies a higher
minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. for instance, investments with maturities of
greater than three years require a minimum rating of aa-/aa3 at the time of investment. government
regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-u.s. subsidiaries, or the absence of a
rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. substantially all of
our investments in debt instruments are with a/a2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial
majority of the issuers are rated aa-/aa3 or better. additionally, we limit the amount of credit
exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty’s relative credit
standing. as of september 26, 2009, the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not
exceed $500 million.

credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. the
amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the
amounts, if any, by which a counterparty’s obligations exceed our obligations with that
counterparty, because we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible
to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions.

the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit
environment, with credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses on our available-for-sale
debt instruments limited to less than $55 million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008. in
addition, we continue to be able to invest in high-credit-quality investments. with the exception
of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments,
we have not seen significant liquidation delays, and for those that have matured we have received
the full par value of our original debt investments. we do not intend to sell our debt investments
that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). in addition, it is
not more likely than not that we will be required to sell our debt investments that have unrealized
losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) before we recover the amortized cost basis.

as of september 26, 2009, our balance of cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in
trading assets, and short-term investments included $10.7 billion with a remaining maturity of less
than one year. as of september 26, 2009, our cumulative unrealized losses, net of corresponding
hedging activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were approximately $50
million (approximately $145 million as of december 27, 2008). as of september 26, 2009, our
cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were
approximately $90 million (approximately $215 million as of december 27, 2008). substantially all
of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations that occurred in an unstable
credit environment that resulted in a decrease in the liquidity for these debt instruments.

we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate
exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors. we intend to continue
to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our
investment policy as deemed necessary. based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio
and our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result
of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations.

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. we have an ongoing
authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the
issuance of commercial paper. maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during the
first nine months of 2009 were approximately $610 million, although no commercial paper remained
outstanding as of september 26, 2009. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and
p-1 by moody’s as of september 26, 2009. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on
file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other
securities.

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next
12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test,
working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions
or strategic investments.

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(continued)

fair value of financial instruments

fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. when
determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would
transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or
liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance.

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at
fair value on a recurring basis. when fair value is determined using observable market prices, the
credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument. when fair value is
determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk
and/or intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate.
during the first nine months of 2009, changes in counterparty credit risk and our own credit risk
did not have a significant impact on the valuation of our assets and liabilities measured and
recorded at fair value.

when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of
the instruments being measured, we classify those instruments as level 3. as of september 26, 2009,
our financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $17.2
billion of assets, of which $1.5 billion (9%) were classified as level 3. in addition, our
financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $373
million of liabilities, of which $192 million (51%) were classified as level 3. during the first
nine months of 2009, we transferred approximately $415 million of assets from level 3 to level 2.
these assets consisted of floating-rate notes that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 due to
a greater availability of observable market data and/or non-binding market consensus prices to
value or corroborate the value of our instruments. during the first nine months of 2009, we
recognized an insignificant amount of gains or losses on the assets that were transferred from
level 3 to level 2.

during the first nine months of 2009, the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured and
recorded at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value gains totaling
$69 million. of this amount, gains of $60 million were recognized in our consolidated condensed
statements of operations and gains of $9 million were included in other comprehensive income.
during the first nine months of 2009, we did not experience any significant realized gains (losses)
related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio.

marketable debt instruments

as of september 26, 2009, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
included $15.9 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $672 million was
classified as level 1, $13.7 billion as level 2, and $1.5 billion as level 3.

when available, we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable
debt instruments. if observable market prices are not available, we use non-binding market
consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data, if available, or
non-observable market data. when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument,
we use observable market quotes to price our instruments, in lieu of prices from other sources.

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable
market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. marketable debt
instruments in this category generally include certain of our floating-rate notes, corporate bonds,
and money market fund deposits. management judgment was required to determine our policy that
defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to
be considered active. our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments
generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the
valuation date of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual
instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount
of the issued instrument.

56



 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(continued)
approximately 10% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at
fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage
of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. when
observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt
instruments using: non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market
data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash
flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.
non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing
providers or brokers. these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding
and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and
the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a
lesser degree non-observable market inputs. we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices
with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exist. the
discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as libor-based yield curves,
currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. approximately 40% of our balance of marketable
debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified
as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are
corroborated with observable market data and approximately 50% due to the usage of a discounted
cash flow model. marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 generally include commercial
paper, bank time deposits, municipal bonds, certain of our money market fund deposits, and a
majority of floating-rate notes and corporate bonds.
our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis
and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to
corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. when
observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and
non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. marketable debt instruments in
this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our floating-rate notes and
corporate bonds. all of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as level 3, and
substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not
able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for
asset-backed securities.
equity securities
as of september 26, 2009, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a
recurring basis included $766 million of marketable equity securities. of these securities, $720
million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical
securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity
securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period
prior to the valuation date for each individual security, including the number of days each
individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total
outstanding shares of that security. the fair values of our investments in clearwire corporation
($301 million) and vmware, inc. ($183 million) constituted a majority of the fair values of the
marketable equity securities that we classified as level 1. marketable equity securities classified
as level 2 ($46 million) were classified as such because their valuations were either based on
quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific
restrictions.
contractual obligations
during the third quarter of 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of junior subordinated convertible
debentures (the 2009 debentures) due in 2039. the 2009 debentures pay a fixed annual rate of 3.25%,
to be paid semiannually beginning february 1, 2010. our total
cash payments (including
anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the consolidated condensed balance
sheets and excluding fair value adjustments that affect the amount recorded on the consolidated
condensed balance sheets) over the life of this long-term debt obligation are expected to be
approximately $4.0 billion. any future settlement of convertible debt would reduce total
interest payments.
