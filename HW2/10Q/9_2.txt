references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and financing
segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after excluding

review of first quarter 2018 results 
 
exxonmobil’s first
quarter 2018 earnings were $4.7 billion, or $1.09 per share assuming
dilution, compared with $4 billion a year earlier. increased commodity
prices, coupled with a focus on operating efficiently and strengthening the
portfolio, resulted in higher earnings and the highest cash flow from
operations and asset sales since 2014. 
 
through new
discoveries and acquired acreage, the corporation has positioned its upstream
portfolio well for future growth. the corporation also made good progress on
plans to improve the production mix and grow premium product sales in the
downstream and chemical businesses.

upstream
earnings were $3,497 million in the first quarter of 2018, up $1,245 million
from the first quarter of 2017.
·        
higher
liquids and gas realizations increased earnings by $1,430 million. 
·        
lower volume
and mix effects, including the impact from the papua new guinea earthquake,
decreased earnings by $190 million. 
·        
all other
items increased earnings by $10 million, as the $366 million gain on
the scarborough sale in australia was partially offset by higher expenses. 
·        
u.s. upstream
earnings were $429 million, up $447 million from the prior year.
·        
non‑u.s.
upstream earnings were $3,068 million, up $798 million from the prior
year.
·        
on an oil‑equivalent
basis, production decreased 6 percent from the first quarter of 2017.
·        
liquids
production totaled 2.2 million barrels per day, down 117,000 barrels
per day as lower volumes from decline, entitlements, and divestments, were
partially offset by growth in north america. 
·        
natural gas
production was 10 billion cubic feet per day, down 870 million cubic
feet per day driven by higher downtime, including impacts from the papua new
guinea earthquake, lower entitlements, and base decline.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2018 was $10.0 billion,
including asset sales of $1.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from the
comparable 2017 period primarily due to higher earnings and increased proceeds
from asset management activity.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $8.5 billion for the first quarter of 2018, $0.3
billion higher than 2017. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $4.8 billion, an increase of $0.7 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $4.5 billion for
depreciation and depletion was essentially in line with 2017. changes in
operational working capital increased cash flows by $0.4 billion, down $0.4
billion from the prior year period. all other items net decreased cash flows by
$1.1 billion in 2018 compared to a reduction of $1.2 billion in 2017. see the
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for additional details. 
 
investing activities
for the first quarter of 2018 used net cash of $1.9 billion, a decrease of $1.9
billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property, plant
and equipment of $3.3 billion was $0.5 billion higher than 2017. proceeds from
asset sales of $1.4 billion increased $0.8 billion. investments and advances decreased
$1.6 billion, principally reflecting the absence of the deposit into escrow of
the maximum potential contingent consideration payable as a result of the
acquisition of interoil corporation in 2017.
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $5.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, an increase
of $2.5 billion from 2017. the net reduction in short and long term debt was
$1.9 billion compared to a net addition of $0.4 billion in 2017. 
 
during the first quarter
of 2018, exxon mobil corporation purchased 5 million shares of its common stock
for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.4 billion. these purchases were made to
offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the
company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,239
million at year-end to 4,234 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018.
purchases may be made both in the open market and through negotiated
transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time
without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $3.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter of 2018
through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to
$3.2 billion at year-end 2017.
 
total debt at the end
of the first quarter of 2018 was $40.6 billion compared to $42.3 billion at
year-end 2017. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 17.2 percent
at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to 17.9 percent at year-end
2017.

the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial
requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

(1) includes
“other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are included in “production and
manufacturing expenses” and “selling, general and administrative expenses.”
 
total taxes were $11.3 billion for the first quarter of 2018,
an increase of $1.8 billion from 2017. income tax expense increased by $0.6
billion to $2.5 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the effective income
tax rate was 40 percent compared to 38 percent in the prior year period due to
a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. total other taxes and
duties increased by $1.2 billion to $8.8 billion.
 
during the first three months of 2018, there were no
significant changes to the corporation’s reasonable estimates of the income tax
effects reflected in 2017 for the changes in tax law and tax rate from the
enactment of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act and following guidance outlined in
the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118. the impact of tax law changes
on the corporation’s financial statements could differ from its estimates due
to further analysis of the new law, regulatory guidance, technical corrections
legislation, or guidance under u.s. gaap. if significant changes occur, the
corporation will provide updated information in connection with future
regulatory filings.
 
in the united states, the corporation has various ongoing
u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with the internal revenue service
(irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has asserted penalties
associated with several of those positions. the corporation has not recognized
the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not expect the
penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has filed a
refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court with
respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution of all
positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse effect on
the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

capital and exploration expenditures in the first

the corporation anticipates an investment level of $24 billion in 2018. actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions. 



in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.
see part ii. other information, item 1. legal proceedings in this report for
information concerning a civil penalty assessment related to this matter which
the corporation is contesting.



the
groningen field is operated by nederlandse aardolie maatschappij (nam), a
netherlands company owned 50 percent by affiliates of the corporation. nam has
a 60 percent interest in the groningen field. on march 29, 2018, the dutch
cabinet notified parliament of its intention to further reduce previously
legislated groningen gas extraction in response to seismic events over the last
several years. affiliates of the corporation and their partners are actively in
discussions with the government on the associated implementation measures. if
the cabinet’s intentions are implemented, the reduction to the corporation’s
proved reserves could be up to 0.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels. in addition,
the seismic activity has yielded various claims. where losses are probable and
reasonably estimable, liabilities have been recorded. the corporation does not
expect these matters to have a material effect on the corporation’s operations
or financial condition. while the future production profile and other
considerations related to the groningen field could vary depending on a wide
variety of factors, reduced gas extraction in the future is expected to result
in lower reported production, earnings and cash flows than in recent years for
the corporation’s share of nam.



recently issued accounting standards
 
effective january 1, 2019, exxonmobil will
adopt the financial accounting standards board’s standard, leases (topic
842), as amended. the standard requires all leases with an initial term
greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease
liability. the corporation is gathering and evaluating data and recently
acquired a system to facilitate implementation. we are progressing an
assessment of the magnitude of the effect on the corporation’s financial
statements.

review of first quarter 2018 results 
 
exxonmobil’s first
quarter 2018 earnings were $4.7 billion, or $1.09 per share assuming
dilution, compared with $4 billion a year earlier. increased commodity
prices, coupled with a focus on operating efficiently and strengthening the
portfolio, resulted in higher earnings and the highest cash flow from
operations and asset sales since 2014. 
 
through new

portfolio well for future growth. the corporation also made good progress on
plans to improve the production mix and grow premium product sales in the
downstream and chemical businesses.

feet per day driven by higher downtime, including impacts from the papua new
guinea earthquake, lower entitlements, and base decline.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes
reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the
terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first quarter of 2018 was $10.0 billion,
including asset sales of $1.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from the
comparable 2017 period primarily due to higher earnings and increased proceeds
from asset management activity.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $8.5 billion for the first quarter of 2018, $0.3
billion higher than 2017. the major source of funds was net income including
noncontrolling interests of $4.8 billion, an increase of $0.7 billion from the
prior year period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $4.5 billion for
depreciation and depletion was essentially in line with 2017. changes in
operational working capital increased cash flows by $0.4 billion, down $0.4
billion from the prior year period. all other items net decreased cash flows by
$1.1 billion in 2018 compared to a reduction of $1.2 billion in 2017. see the
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for additional details. 
 
investing activities
for the first quarter of 2018 used net cash of $1.9 billion, a decrease of $1.9
billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property, plant
and equipment of $3.3 billion was $0.5 billion higher than 2017. proceeds from
asset sales of $1.4 billion increased $0.8 billion. investments and advances decreased
$1.6 billion, principally reflecting the absence of the deposit into escrow of
the maximum potential contingent consideration payable as a result of the
acquisition of interoil corporation in 2017.
 
net cash used by
financing activities was $5.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, an increase
of $2.5 billion from 2017. the net reduction in short and long term debt was
$1.9 billion compared to a net addition of $0.4 billion in 2017. 
 
during the first quarter
of 2018, exxon mobil corporation purchased 5 million shares of its common stock
for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.4 billion. these purchases were made to
offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction with the
company’s benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,239
million at year-end to 4,234 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018.
purchases may be made both in the open market and through negotiated
transactions, and may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time
without prior notice.
 
the corporation
distributed a total of $3.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter of 2018
through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to
$3.2 billion at year-end 2017.
 
total debt at the end
of the first quarter of 2018 was $40.6 billion compared to $42.3 billion at
year-end 2017. the corporation's debt to total capital ratio was 17.2 percent
at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to 17.9 percent at year-end
2017.

the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial
requirements, supplemented by short-term and long-term debt as required.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

(1) includes
“other taxes and duties” plus taxes that are included in “production and
manufacturing expenses” and “selling, general and administrative expenses.”
 
total taxes were $11.3 billion for the first quarter of 2018,
an increase of $1.8 billion from 2017. income tax expense increased by $0.6
billion to $2.5 billion reflecting higher pre-tax income. the effective income
tax rate was 40 percent compared to 38 percent in the prior year period due to
a higher share of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. total other taxes and
duties increased by $1.2 billion to $8.8 billion.
 
during the first three months of 2018, there were no
significant changes to the corporation’s reasonable estimates of the income tax
effects reflected in 2017 for the changes in tax law and tax rate from the
enactment of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act and following guidance outlined in
the sec staff accounting bulletin no. 118. the impact of tax law changes
on the corporation’s financial statements could differ from its estimates due
to further analysis of the new law, regulatory guidance, technical corrections
legislation, or guidance under u.s. gaap. if significant changes occur, the
corporation will provide updated information in connection with future
regulatory filings.
 
in the united states, the corporation has various ongoing
u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with the internal revenue service
(irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has asserted penalties
associated with several of those positions. the corporation has not recognized
the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not expect the
penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has filed a
refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court with
respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution of all
positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse effect on
the corporation’s net income or liquidity.

capital and exploration expenditures in the first
quarter of 2018 were $4.9 billion, up 17 percent from the first quarter of 2017.
the corporation anticipates an investment level of $24 billion in 2018. actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions. 



in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.
see part ii. other information, item 1. legal proceedings in this report for
information concerning a civil penalty assessment related to this matter which
the corporation is contesting.



the
groningen field is operated by nederlandse aardolie maatschappij (nam), a
netherlands company owned 50 percent by affiliates of the corporation. nam has
a 60 percent interest in the groningen field. on march 29, 2018, the dutch
cabinet notified parliament of its intention to further reduce previously
legislated groningen gas extraction in response to seismic events over the last
several years. affiliates of the corporation and their partners are actively in
discussions with the government on the associated implementation measures. if
the cabinet’s intentions are implemented, the reduction to the corporation’s
proved reserves could be up to 0.8 billion oil-equivalent barrels. in addition,
the seismic activity has yielded various claims. where losses are probable and
reasonably estimable, liabilities have been recorded. the corporation does not
expect these matters to have a material effect on the corporation’s operations
or financial condition. while the future production profile and other
considerations related to the groningen field could vary depending on a wide
variety of factors, reduced gas extraction in the future is expected to result
in lower reported production, earnings and cash flows than in recent years for
the corporation’s share of nam.



recently issued accounting standards
 
effective january 1, 2019, exxonmobil will
adopt the financial accounting standards board’s standard, leases (topic
842), as amended. the standard requires all leases with an initial term
greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and a lease
liability. the corporation is gathering and evaluating data and recently
acquired a system to facilitate implementation. we are progressing an
assessment of the magnitude of the effect on the corporation’s financial
statements.
