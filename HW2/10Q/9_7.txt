references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and
financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of second quarter 2016 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
second quarter 2016 earnings were $1.7 billion, or $0.41 per diluted
share, compared with $4.2 billion a year earlier. the results reflect
sharply lower commodity prices, weaker refining margins and continued strength
in the chemical segment.
 
while
our financial results reflect a volatile industry environment, exxonmobil
remains focused on business fundamentals, cost discipline and advancing
selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive
advantage. the corporation benefits from scale and integration, which provide
the financial flexibility to invest in attractive opportunities and grow
long-term shareholder value.



 


 


 



 
earnings
in the first six months of 2016 were $3.5 billion, down $5.6 billion, or 62
percent, from 2015.
 
earnings
per share assuming dilution were $0.84.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $10.3 billion, down 36 percent from 2015.
 
oil-equivalent
production was unchanged at 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, with
liquids up 6.6 percent and natural gas down 6.7 percent.
 
the
corporation distributed $6.2 billion in dividends to shareholders.

upstream earnings
were $294 million in the second quarter of 2016, down $1,737 million
from the second quarter of 2015. lower liquids and gas realizations decreased
earnings by $2.2 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings
by $50 million. all other items, including lower expenses, the absence of
a one-time deferred income tax impact related to the tax rate increase in
alberta, canada, and favorable foreign exchange effects increased earnings by
$450 million.
 
on an oil‑equivalent basis,
production was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2015. liquids
production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, up 39,000 barrels per
day. project ramp‑up was partly offset by field decline and downtime
mainly in canada and nigeria. natural gas production was 9.8 billion cubic
feet per day, down 366 million cubic feet per day from 2015 including
field decline and divestment impacts.
 
u.s. upstream earnings declined
$467 million from the second quarter of 2015 to a loss of
$514 million in the second quarter of 2016. non‑u.s. upstream earnings
were $808 million, down $1,270 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream earnings were $218 million,
down $4,668 million from the first half of 2015. lower realizations
decreased earnings by $4.9 billion. favorable volume and mix effects
increased earnings by $20 million. all other items increased earnings by
$180 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence
of asset management gains.
 
on an oil‑equivalent basis,
production of 4.1 million barrels per day was flat compared to the first
half of 2015. liquids production of 2.4 million barrels per day increased
150,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up partly offset by field
decline and downtime mainly from the canadian wildfires. natural gas production
of 10.2 billion cubic feet per day decreased 730 million cubic feet
per day from 2015 largely due to regulatory restrictions in the netherlands,
field decline and divestment impacts.
 
u.s. upstream earnings declined
$1,247 million from 2015 to a loss of $1,346 million in 2016. earnings
outside the u.s. were $1,564 million, down $3,421 million from the
prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

downstream
earnings were $825 million, down $681 million from the second quarter
of 2015. weaker refining margins decreased earnings by $850 million while
favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130 million. all
other items increased earnings by $40 million, including lower maintenance
expenses partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects. petroleum
product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 237,000 barrels per
day lower than the prior year due in part to asset management activity. 
 
earnings
from the u.s. downstream were $412 million, flat with the second quarter
of 2015. non‑u.s. downstream earnings of $413 million were
$681 million lower than last year. 



 


 


 



 
downstream
earnings of $1,731 million for the first six months of 2016 decreased $1,442 million
from 2015. weaker refining margins decreased earnings by $1.7 billion,
while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $150 million. all other
items increased earnings by $130 million, mainly reflecting lower
maintenance expense. petroleum product sales of 5.4 million barrels per
day were 358,000 barrels per day lower than 2015 due in part to asset
management activity.
 
u.s.
downstream earnings were $599 million, a decrease of $380 million from
2015. non‑u.s. downstream earnings were $1,132 million, down
$1,062 million from the prior year.

chemical earnings of $1,217 million
were $29 million lower than the second quarter of 2015. margins increased
earnings by $150 million. volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$70 million. all other items decreased earnings by $250 million, due
to the absence of asset management gains in the u.s. partly offset by lower
expenses. second quarter prime product sales of 6.3 million metric
tons were 232,000 metric tons higher than the prior year's second quarter.
 
u.s. chemical earnings were
$509 million, down $226 million from the second quarter of 2015
reflecting the absence of asset management gains. non‑u.s. chemical
earnings of $708 million were $197 million higher than last year. 



 


 


 



 
chemical earnings of $2,572
million for the first six months of 2016 increased $344 million from 2015.
stronger margins increased earnings by $380 million. favorable volume and

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2016 was $5.5 billion,
including asset sales of $1 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $9.3 billion for the first six months of 2016,
$7.5 billion lower than 2015. the major source of funds was net income
including noncontrolling interests of $3.5 billion, a decrease of $5.9 billion
from the prior year period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $9.6
billion for depreciation and depletion increased by $0.8 billion. changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $1.7 billion in 2016 and
$1.5 billion in 2015. all other items net decreased cash by $2.0 billion in
2016 and increased cash by $0.2 billion in 2015. for additional details, see
the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first six months of 2016 used net cash of $7.5 billion, a decrease of
$5.3 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $8.9 billion was $5.1 billion lower than 2015. proceeds
from asset sales of $1.2 billion increased $0.1 billion. 
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2016 was $10.5 billion,
including asset sales of $1.2 billion, and decreased $7.4 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
during the first
quarter of 2016, the corporation issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt and
used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used by financing
activities was $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2016, $2.8 billion lower
than 2015 reflecting the 2016 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of exxonmobil stock in 2016.
  
during the first six
months of 2016, exxon mobil corporation purchased 9 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.7 billion. these purchases
were made to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and
programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,156 million at year-end to 4,147
million at the end of the second quarter 2016. purchases may be made in both
the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
  


20  



 


the corporation
distributed to shareholders a total of $3.1 billion in the second quarter of
2016 through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2016 was the
same as at the end of the second quarter of 2015.
 
total debt of $44.5
billion compared to $38.7 billion at year-end 2015. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 20.1 percent at the end of the second quarter of
2016 compared to 18.0 percent at year-end 2015.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

income,

quarter of 2016, a decrease of $2.8 billion from 2015. income tax expense
decreased by $2.0 billion to $0.7 billion reflecting lower pre-tax income. the
effective income tax rate was 40 percent compared to 45 percent in the prior
year period due to a higher share of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. sales-based taxes and all other taxes and duties decreased by
$0.8 billion to $12.7 billion as a result of lower sales realizations.



 


 


 



 
income,
sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $24.9 billion for the first
six months of 2016, a decrease of $5.7 billion from 2015. income tax expense
decreased by $3.6 billion to $0.7 billion as a result of lower earnings and a
lower effective tax rate. the effective income tax rate was 31 percent compared
to 39 percent in the prior year period due to a higher share of earnings in
lower tax jurisdictions. sales-based and all
other taxes decreased by $2.1 billion to $24.3 billion
as a result of lower sales realizations.
 
in
the united states, the corporation has various u.s. federal income tax
positions at issue with the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years
2006-2011. the irs has asserted penalties for all years associated with
several of those positions. the corporation has not recognized the
penalties as an expense because, in the corporation’s judgment, the irs should
not be able to sustain the penalty under applicable law. unfavorable
resolution of these issues would not have a materially adverse effect on the
corporation’s net income or liquidity. the irs has not completed its audit
of tax years after 2011.

capital and
exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2016
were $5.2 billion, down 38 percent from the second quarter of 2015. 



 


 


 



 
capital and exploration expenditures in the first six months of
2016 were $10.3 billion, down 36 percent from the first six months of 2015 due
primarily to lower major project spending. given recent efficiencies, market
capture, and project selectivity, the corporation anticipates a 2016 investment
level below the $23.2 billion target that was referenced last quarter. actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions.
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, revenue from contracts with customers.
the standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. the standard is required to be adopted beginning
january 1, 2018. 
 
“sales and other operating revenue” on the
consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes
on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard, revenue will
exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. this change in
reporting will not impact earnings.
 
the corporation continues to evaluate
other areas of the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements. 
 
in february 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, leases. the standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. the standard is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2019. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource
recoveries; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors
including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of
economic recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts;
changes in law or government regulation, including tax and environmental
requirements; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; changes in technical
or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading
"factors affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our
website and in item 1a of exxonmobil's 2015 form 10-k. we assume no duty
to update these statements as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.

references in this
discussion to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to exxonmobil
(u.s. gaap) from the consolidated income statement. unless otherwise indicated,
references to earnings, upstream, downstream, chemical and corporate and
financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are exxonmobil's share after
excluding amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.
  
 
review
of second quarter 2016 results 
 
exxonmobil’s
second quarter 2016 earnings were $1.7 billion, or $0.41 per diluted
share, compared with $4.2 billion a year earlier. the results reflect
sharply lower commodity prices, weaker refining margins and continued strength
in the chemical segment.
 
while
our financial results reflect a volatile industry environment, exxonmobil
remains focused on business fundamentals, cost discipline and advancing
selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive
advantage. the corporation benefits from scale and integration, which provide
the financial flexibility to invest in attractive opportunities and grow
long-term shareholder value.



 


 


 



 
earnings
in the first six months of 2016 were $3.5 billion, down $5.6 billion, or 62
percent, from 2015.
 
earnings
per share assuming dilution were $0.84.
 
capital
and exploration expenditures were $10.3 billion, down 36 percent from 2015.
 
oil-equivalent
production was unchanged at 4.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, with
liquids up 6.6 percent and natural gas down 6.7 percent.
 
the
corporation distributed $6.2 billion in dividends to shareholders.

upstream earnings
were $294 million in the second quarter of 2016, down $1,737 million
from the second quarter of 2015. lower liquids and gas realizations decreased
earnings by $2.2 billion, while volume and mix effects increased earnings
by $50 million. all other items, including lower expenses, the absence of
a one-time deferred income tax impact related to the tax rate increase in
alberta, canada, and favorable foreign exchange effects increased earnings by
$450 million.
 
on an oil‑equivalent basis,
production was essentially flat with the second quarter of 2015. liquids
production totaled 2.3 million barrels per day, up 39,000 barrels per
day. project ramp‑up was partly offset by field decline and downtime
mainly in canada and nigeria. natural gas production was 9.8 billion cubic
feet per day, down 366 million cubic feet per day from 2015 including
field decline and divestment impacts.
 
u.s. upstream earnings declined
$467 million from the second quarter of 2015 to a loss of
$514 million in the second quarter of 2016. non‑u.s. upstream earnings
were $808 million, down $1,270 million from the prior year.



 


 


 



 
upstream earnings were $218 million,
down $4,668 million from the first half of 2015. lower realizations
decreased earnings by $4.9 billion. favorable volume and mix effects
increased earnings by $20 million. all other items increased earnings by
$180 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence
of asset management gains.
 
on an oil‑equivalent basis,
production of 4.1 million barrels per day was flat compared to the first
half of 2015. liquids production of 2.4 million barrels per day increased
150,000 barrels per day, with project ramp‑up partly offset by field
decline and downtime mainly from the canadian wildfires. natural gas production
of 10.2 billion cubic feet per day decreased 730 million cubic feet
per day from 2015 largely due to regulatory restrictions in the netherlands,
field decline and divestment impacts.
 
u.s. upstream earnings declined
$1,247 million from 2015 to a loss of $1,346 million in 2016. earnings
outside the u.s. were $1,564 million, down $3,421 million from the
prior year.

listed below are descriptions of exxonmobil’s volumes reconciliation
factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.
 
entitlements - net
interest are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes caused by
non-operational changes to volume-determining factors. these factors consist of
net interest changes specified in production sharing contracts (pscs) which
typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes
achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner
investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture
agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. once a
net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by
subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.
 
entitlements - price,
spend and other are changes to exxonmobil’s share of production volumes resulting
from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. these
factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one
period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
 
quotas are changes in
exxonmobil’s allowable production arising from production constraints imposed
by countries which are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting
countries (opec). volumes reported in this category would have been readily
producible in the absence of the quota.
 
divestments are reductions in
exxonmobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or
partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other
economic consideration. 
 
growth and other factors comprise all
other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above
definitions that may affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors
include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work
program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges,
downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial
terms that do not affect entitlements.

favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130 million. all
other items increased earnings by $40 million, including lower maintenance
expenses partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects. petroleum
product sales of 5.5 million barrels per day were 237,000 barrels per

because of the
ongoing nature of our asset management and divestment program, we believe it is
useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together
with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder
distributions.
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the second quarter of 2016 was $5.5 billion,
including asset sales of $1 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
cash provided by
operating activities totaled $9.3 billion for the first six months of 2016,
$7.5 billion lower than 2015. the major source of funds was net income
including noncontrolling interests of $3.5 billion, a decrease of $5.9 billion
from the prior year period. the adjustment for the noncash provision of $9.6
billion for depreciation and depletion increased by $0.8 billion. changes in
operational working capital decreased cash flows by $1.7 billion in 2016 and
$1.5 billion in 2015. all other items net decreased cash by $2.0 billion in
2016 and increased cash by $0.2 billion in 2015. for additional details, see
the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows on page 6. 
 
investing activities
for the first six months of 2016 used net cash of $7.5 billion, a decrease of
$5.3 billion compared to the prior year. spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $8.9 billion was $5.1 billion lower than 2015. proceeds
from asset sales of $1.2 billion increased $0.1 billion. 
 
cash flow from
operations and asset sales in the first six months of 2016 was $10.5 billion,
including asset sales of $1.2 billion, and decreased $7.4 billion from the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to lower earnings.
 
during the first
quarter of 2016, the corporation issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt and
used part of the proceeds to reduce short-term debt. net cash used by financing
activities was $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2016, $2.8 billion lower
than 2015 reflecting the 2016 debt issuance and a lower level of purchases of
shares of exxonmobil stock in 2016.
  
during the first six
months of 2016, exxon mobil corporation purchased 9 million shares of its
common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $0.7 billion. these purchases
were made to acquire shares in conjunction with the company’s benefit plans and
programs. shares outstanding decreased from 4,156 million at year-end to 4,147
million at the end of the second quarter 2016. purchases may be made in both
the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
 
  


20  



 


the corporation
distributed to shareholders a total of $3.1 billion in the second quarter of
2016 through dividends. 
 
total cash and cash
equivalents of $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2016 was the
same as at the end of the second quarter of 2015.
 
total debt of $44.5
billion compared to $38.7 billion at year-end 2015. the corporation's debt to
total capital ratio was 20.1 percent at the end of the second quarter of
2016 compared to 18.0 percent at year-end 2015.
 
the corporation has
access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity.
internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial
requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
 
the corporation, as
part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of
assets for potential upgrade. because of the ongoing nature of this program,
dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in
either gains or losses. additionally, the corporation continues to evaluate
opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets
or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. key criteria
for evaluating acquisitions include potential for future growth and attractive
current valuations. acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the
corporation’s common stock, or both.
 
litigation and other
contingencies are discussed in note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.

sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $13.4 billion for the second
quarter of 2016, a decrease of $2.8 billion from 2015. income tax expense

$0.8 billion to $12.7 billion as a result of lower sales realizations.

sales-based and all other taxes and duties totaled $24.9 billion for the first
six months of 2016, a decrease of $5.7 billion from 2015. income tax expense
decreased by $3.6 billion to $0.7 billion as a result of lower earnings and a
lower effective tax rate. the effective income tax rate was 31 percent compared
to 39 percent in the prior year period due to a higher share of earnings in
lower tax jurisdictions. sales-based and all
other taxes decreased by $2.1 billion to $24.3 billion

in
the united states, the corporation has various u.s. federal income tax
positions at issue with the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years
2006-2011. the irs has asserted penalties for all years associated with
several of those positions. the corporation has not recognized the
penalties as an expense because, in the corporation’s judgment, the irs should
not be able to sustain the penalty under applicable law. unfavorable
resolution of these issues would not have a materially adverse effect on the
corporation’s net income or liquidity. the irs has not completed its audit
of tax years after 2011.

capital and
exploration expenditures in the second quarter of 2016
were $5.2 billion, down 38 percent from the second quarter of 2015. 



 


 


 



 
capital and exploration expenditures in the first six months of
2016 were $10.3 billion, down 36 percent from the first six months of 2015 due
primarily to lower major project spending. given recent efficiencies, market
capture, and project selectivity, the corporation anticipates a 2016 investment
level below the $23.2 billion target that was referenced last quarter. actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions.
 
in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. exxonmobil continues to comply with all sanctions and regulatory
licenses applicable to its affiliates’ investments in the russian federation.

recently issued accounting standards
 
in may 2014, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, revenue from contracts with customers.
the standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts
with customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands
disclosure requirements. the standard is required to be adopted beginning
january 1, 2018. 
 
“sales and other operating revenue” on the
consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes
on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard, revenue will
exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties. this change in
reporting will not impact earnings.
 
the corporation continues to evaluate
other areas of the standard and its effect on the corporation’s financial
statements. 
 
in february 2016, the financial accounting
standards board issued a new standard, leases. the standard requires all
leases with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance
sheet as an asset and a lease liability. the standard is required to be adopted
beginning january 1, 2019. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect
on the corporation’s financial statements.  
 
forward-looking statements
 
statements
relating to future plans, projections, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. actual financial and operating results, including project plans,
costs, timing, and capacities; capital and exploration expenditures; resource
recoveries; and share purchase levels, could differ materially due to factors
including: changes in oil or gas prices or other market or economic conditions
affecting the oil and gas industry, including the scope and duration of
economic recessions; the outcome of exploration and development efforts;
changes in law or government regulation, including tax and environmental
requirements; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; changes in technical
or operating conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading
"factors affecting future results" in the “investors” section of our
website and in item 1a of exxonmobil's 2015 form 10-k. we assume no duty
to update these statements as of any future date.  
 
the term
“project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
