share — diluted) in the corresponding 2016 period. net income attributable to chevron corporation for the first six months of 2017 was $4.13 billion ($2.18 per share — diluted), compared with a loss of $2.20 billion ($1.17 per share — diluted) in the first six months of 2016.upstream earnings in second quarter 2017 were $853 million compared with a loss of $2.46 billion a year earlier. the increase was mainly due to lower impairment charges, partially offset by higher depreciation expenses from increased production. the improvement also includes higher crude oil realizations and volumes, higher natural gas sales volumes, lower tax items, higher gains on asset sales and lower operating expenses. earnings for the first six months of 2017 were $2.37 billion compared with a loss of $3.92 billion a year earlier. the increase was due to higher crude oil realizations, lower depreciation expense primarily due to lower impairments, higher gains on asset sales and increased natural gas sales volumes.downstream earnings in second quarter 2017 were $1.20 billion compared with $1.28 billion in the corresponding 2016 period. the decrease was due to absence of 2016 asset sales gains, partially offset by higher margins on refined product sales. earnings for the first six months of 2017 were $2.12 billion compared with $2.01 billion in the corresponding 2016 period. the increase was due to higher margins on refined product sales and the absence of a 2016 asset impairment. partially offsetting the increase were lower gains on asset sales.refer to pages 28 through 30 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “all other” activities for second quarter and first six months of 2017 versus the same period in 2016.business environment and outlookchevron is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: angola, argentina, australia, azerbaijan, bangladesh, brazil, canada, china, colombia, democratic republic of the congo, denmark, indonesia, kazakhstan, myanmar, nigeria, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, philippines, republic of congo, singapore, south africa, south korea, thailand, trinidad and tobago, the united kingdom, the united states, and venezuela.24table of contentsearnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. the biggest factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil. the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014. the downturn in the price of crude oil has impacted the company's results of operations, cash flows, leverage, capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook. a sustained lower price environment could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods. the company is responding with reductions in operating expenses, pacing and re-focusing of capital and exploratory expenditures, and increased asset sales. the company anticipates that crude oil prices will increase in the future, as continued growth in demand and a slowing in supply growth should bring global markets into balance; however, the timing of any such increase is unknown. in the company's downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. it is the company's objective to deliver competitive results and shareholder value in any business environment. the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. this is due to the mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. as a result, a decline or increase in the effective tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. note 11 provides the company’s effective income tax rate for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016.refer to the "cautionary statement relevant to forward-looking information" on page 2 and to "risk factors" on pages 20 through 22 of the company’s 2016 annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations or financial condition.the company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. the company's asset sale program for 2016 and 2017 is targeting before-tax proceeds of $5-10 billion. proceeds and deposits related to asset sales were $2.8 billion in 2016 and $2.5 billion in the first six months of 2017. refer to the "results of operations" section beginning on page 28 for discussions of net gains on asset sales during 2017. asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could result in significant gains or losses. the company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec), actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. the company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax laws and regulations.the company continues to actively manage its schedule of work, contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. however, price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, among other things, the general level of inflation, commodity prices and prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. costs in some north american unconventional plays have stabilized and are starting to rise with higher levels of activity and investment.  costs outside of the north american unconventional space continue to decline driven by reduced investment and the lower oil price environment. capital and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses can also be affected by damage to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, or other factors.25table of contentsthe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for brent crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil, and u.s. henry hub natural gas. the brent price averaged $44 per barrel for the full-year 2016. during 2017, brent averaged $50 per barrel in the second quarter, and ended july at about $52. the majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark. brent markets trended lower in a $45-$55 per barrel range throughout the second quarter of 2017, as steadily rising production in the u.s. and recovering production from nigeria and libya eroded confidence in opec’s ability to balance global oil markets. this decline occurred despite ongoing strong compliance among opec producers on production cuts implemented beginning in january 2017, and the agreement reached in may to extend cuts through the first quarter 2018.  oil markets were also undermined by the sluggish rise in u.s. seasonal gasoline demand relative to 2016’s surge, and later than anticipated onset of inventory declines. the wti price averaged $43 per barrel for the full-year 2016. during 2017, wti averaged $48 per barrel in the second quarter, and ended july at about $50. the wti discount to brent was little changed in the second quarter 2017 relative to first quarter 2017 due to persistently high u.s. crude oil inventory levels, growing u.s. production, and ongoing crude exports from the u.s.a differential in crude oil prices exists between high quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur) crudes and those of lower quality (low-gravity, high-sulfur). the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supply/demand balances for each crude type. in second quarter 2017, the differential continued to narrow in north america due to reduced global availability of heavier sour crudes and reduced support for u.s. light sweet crude prices as a result of u.s. production growth.  outside of north america, differentials also continued to narrow as lower output from key middle east producers increased values of heavier sour crudes.chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in california, indonesia, the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, venezuela and in certain fields in angola, china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea. (see page 33 for the company’s average u.s. and international crude oil sales prices.)in contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those markets. fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the united states are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced in north america. in the united states, prices at henry hub averaged $3.03 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the first six months of 2017, compared with $2.02 during the first six months of 2016. at the end of july 2017, the henry hub spot price was $2.84 per mcf. outside the united states, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. chevron sells natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most locations. in some locations, chevron continues to invest in long-term projects to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other markets. the company's long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (lng) are typically linked to crude oil prices. most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market.  the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil prices. international natural gas sales prices averaged $4.37 per mcf during the first six months of 2017, compared with $3.92 per mcf in the same period last year. (see page 33 for the company’s average natural gas sales prices for the u.s. and international regions.)26table of contentsthe company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first six months of 2017 averaged 2.728 million barrels per day. about one-sixth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first six months of 2017 occurred in the opec-member countries of angola, nigeria and venezuela. opec quotas had no effect on the company’s net crude oil production for the second quarter of 2017 or 2016. the company estimates that net oil-equivalent production for the full-year 2017 will grow 4 to 9 percent compared to 2016, assuming a brent crude oil price of $50 per barrel and before the effect of anticipated asset sales.  the impact of 2017 asset sales on full-year production is expected to be in the range of 25,000 to 75,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, depending on the timing of the close of individual transactions. the estimate of full-year production is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by opec; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction, start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; or other disruptions to operations. the outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. investments in certain upstream projects can begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production. a significant majority of chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the united states. in the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait, production was shut-in beginning in may 2015 as a result of difficulties in securing work and equipment permits. net oil-equivalent production in the partitioned zone in 2014 was 81,000 barrels per day. during 2015, net oil-equivalent production averaged 28,000 barrels per day. as of early august 2017, production remained shut-in, and the exact timing of a production restart is uncertain and dependent on dispute resolution between saudi arabia and kuwait. the financial effects from the loss of production in 2015 and 2016 were not significant and are not expected to be significant in 2017.refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 28 and 29 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals. industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets.the company’s most significant marketing areas are the west coast of north america, the u.s. gulf coast, asia and southern africa. chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. refer to the “results of operations” section on pages 29 and 30 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream

marketable securities totaled $4.8 billion at june 30, 2017 and $7.0 billion at year-end 2016. cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2017 was $8.9 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting higher crude oil prices. cash capital and exploratory expenditures totaled $6.8 billion in the first six months of 2017, down $3.5 billion from the year-ago period, reflecting lower activity. cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.5 billion in the first six months of 2017, compared to $1.4 billion in the year ago period.dividends the company paid dividends of $4.1 billion to common shareholders during the first six months of 2017. in july 2017, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.08 per common share, payable in september 2017. debt and capital lease obligations chevron’s total debt and capital lease obligations were $42.9 billion at june 30, 2017, down from $46.1 billion at december 31, 2016. the company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. the outstanding balance for the company's commercial paper program at june 30, 2017 was $4.2 billion. the company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, redeemable long-term obligations and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $17.8 billion at june 30, 2017, and $19.8 billion at december 31, 2016. of these amounts, $9.0 billion was reclassified to long-term at both june 30, 2017, and december 31, 2016. at june 30, 2017, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.at june 30, 2017, the company had $9.0 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. the credit facilities consist of a 364-day facility which enables borrowing of up to $6.9 billion and allows the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, as well as a $2.1 billion five-year facility expiring in december 2020. these facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. the company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the london interbank offered rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at june 30, 2017. in addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in august 2018 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company.the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. the company has outstanding public bonds issued by chevron corporation and texaco capital inc. all of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, chevron corporation and are rated aa- by standard and poor’s corporation and aa2 by moody’s investors service. the company’s u.s. commercial paper is rated a-1+ by standard and poor’s and p-1 by moody’s. all of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.the company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the capital program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. during extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company can also modify capital spending plans to provide flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and also remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.common share repurchase program in july 2010, the board of directors approved an ongoing share repurchase program with no set term or monetary limits. no shares were acquired under the program in 2015, 2016 or through the first six months of 2017, and the company does not plan to acquire any shares under the program for the remainder of the year. from the inception of the program through 2014, the company had purchased 180.9 million shares for $20.0 billion.34table of contentsnoncontrolling interests the company had noncontrolling interests of $1.2 billion at both

inventory was lower than replacement cost.debt ratio total debt as a percentage of total debt plus chevron corporation stockholders’ equity, which indicates the company’s leverage. this ratio was 22.7
