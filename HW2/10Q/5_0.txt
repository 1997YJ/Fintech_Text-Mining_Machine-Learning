item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2017, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.certain revenue information in the section entitled "—three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 and 2017—revenue—foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.executive overview of third quarter resultsour key user metrics and financial results for the third quarter of 2018 are as follows:user growth:•daily active users (daus) were 1.49 billion on average for september 2018, an increase of 9% year-over-year.•monthly active users (maus) were 2.27 billion as of september 30, 2018, an increase of 10% year-over-year.financial results:•revenue was $13.73 billion, up 33% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $13.54 billion, up 33% year-over-year.•total costs and expenses were $7.95 billion.•income from operations was $5.78 billion.•net income was $5.14 billion with diluted earnings per share of $1.76.•capital expenditures were $3.34 billion.•effective tax rate was 13%.•cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $41.21 billion as of september 30, 2018.•headcount was 33,606 as of september 30, 2018, an increase of 45% year-over-year.in the third quarter of 2018, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystems, facebook and instagram, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products that already have significant user bases, such as messenger and whatsapp, as well as continuing to grow features like stories, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we anticipate that additional investments in the following areas will drive significant year-over-year expense growth in 2018: (i) increased investments in safety and security, marketing, video content, and our long-term technology initiatives, and (ii) scaling our headcount and expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities to support our growth. expense growth exceeded revenue growth in the third quarter of 2018, which we anticipate will continue in the remainder of 2018 and 2019.24trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daus, maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated.trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access facebook on mobile devices.•daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement on facebook. note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 25worldwide daus increased 9% to 1.49 billion on average during september 2018 from 1.37 billion during september 2017. users in india, indonesia, and the philippines represented key sources of growth in daus during september 2018, relative to the same period in 2017. •monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community on facebook.as of september 30, 2018, we had 2.27 billion maus, an increase of 10% from september 30, 2017. users in india, indonesia, and the philippines represented key sources of growth in the third quarter of 2018, relative to the same period in 2017.26trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in the third quarter of 2018 in the united states & canada region was more than ten times higher than in the asia-pacific region.note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the customer.27during the third quarter of 2018, worldwide arpu was $6.09, an increase of 20% from the third quarter of 2017. over this period, arpu increased by 30% in united states & canada, 29% in europe, 18% in asia-pacific, and 14% in rest of world. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.28components of results of operationsrevenueadvertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook, instagram, messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies and resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. we recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.payments and other fees. payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices, as well as revenue from various other sources.cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold, and amortization of intangible assets.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, professional services such as content reviewers, as well as amortization of intangible assets.general and administrative. the majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include legal-related costs and professional services.29results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data: three months ended september 30, nine months

nine months of 2018 increased $3.40 billion, or 33%, and $11.24 billion, or 41%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017. the increases were mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue.the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices. for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 92% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 88% and 87%, respectively, in the same periods in 2017. the increases in advertising revenue for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 were due to increases in the average price per ad and the number of ads delivered. during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, the average price per ad increased by 7% and 19%, respectively, as compared with approximately 35% and 25%, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, and the number of ads delivered increased by 25% and 18%, respectively, as compared with approximately 10% and 20%, respectively, in the same periods in 2017. the increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory; factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement, and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products. we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads displayed.foreign exchange impact on revenuethe general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. if we had translated revenue for the three months ended september 30, 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $13.89 billion and $13.70 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, both revenue and advertising revenue would have been $159 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018.     foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our total revenue and advertising revenue in first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. if we had translated revenue for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $38.18 billion and $37.63 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $749 million and $748 million lower than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the first nine months of 2018.31cost of revenue three months ended september

with partnership agreements, including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs.research and development  three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2018 2017 %

the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 increased $605 million, or 29%, and $1.61 billion, or 28%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017. the majority of the increases in both periods were due to increases in payroll and benefits expense as a result of a 45% growth in employee headcount from september 30, 2017 to september 30, 2018 in engineering and other technical functions and increases in professional service expenses. payroll and benefits expense growth in both periods were less than headcount growth partially due to the lapsing of acquisition-related share-based compensation expense.marketing and sales three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september 30,   2018 2017 % change 2018 2017 % change (in millions, except for

foreign exchange impact occurring from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances.provision for income taxes three months ended september 30,   nine months ended september

taxes in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 increased $246 million, or 47%, and $693 million or 47%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017, mostly due to the new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (tax act) and an increase in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the enactment of the tax act.our effective tax rates in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 increased compared to same periods in 2017, primarily due to the new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, partially offset by the decrease in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%.effective tax rate items. our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the united states and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate, as well as a number of other factors, including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the impact of changes in tax law.the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. if our stock price remains constant to the october 29, 2018 price, we expect our effective tax rates for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2019 will be in the mid-teens.integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods. on july 27, 2015, the united states tax court (tax court) issued an opinion in altera corp. v. commissioner (tax court opinion), which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. the tax court opinion was appealed by the commissioner to the ninth circuit court of appeals (ninth circuit). on july 24, 2018, the ninth circuit issued an opinion (ninth circuit opinion) that reversed the tax court opinion. the ninth circuit opinion was subsequently withdrawn and the case is being reheard. since the ninth circuit opinion was withdrawn, we continue to treat our share-based compensation expense in accordance with the tax court opinion. we also continue to monitor developments in this case and any impact the final opinion could have on our consolidated financial statements. had the ninth 33circuit not withdrawn its opinion, our effective tax rate for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 would have been higher.unrecognized tax benefits. as of september 30, 2018, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $2.94 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. these unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. based upon the status of litigation described below, the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, and excluding the effects of the altera corp. v. commissioner case that we are monitoring, we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months.in july 2016, we received a statutory notice of deficiency (notice) from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the irs prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice. as of september 30, 2018, we have not resolved this matter, and proceedings continue in the tax court. in march 2018, we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. the irs applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. if the irs prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. we do not agree with the positions of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice. we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the irs in the two notices. in addition, if the irs prevails in its positions, related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax act. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with asc 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. if the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.34liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.21 billion as of september 30, 2018, a decrease of $505 million from december 31, 2017, mostly due to $21.66 billion of cash generated from operations, offset by $9.61 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $9.38 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock, and $2.66 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $2.73 billion for the first nine months of 2018. as of september 30, 2018, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $6.50 billion, and we anticipate that none of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2018. as of september 30, 2018, we had $244 million of federal tax credit carryforward, of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2018. in addition, we are monitoring the altera corp. v. commissioner case as it applies to our facts and circumstances as it could increase our cash paid for income taxes.in may 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on may 20, 2021. as of september 30, 2018, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our class a common stock. we completed repurchases under this authorization during the second quarter of 2018. in april 2018, the authorization for the repurchase of our class a common stock was increased by an additional $9.0 billion. during the nine months ended september 30, 2018, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 54 million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $9.38 billion. as of september 30, 2018, approximately $3.54 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. in the first nine months of 2018, we paid $2.66 billion of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards.as of september 30, 2018, $13.61 billion of the $41.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. the tax act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. as a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the u.s. without incremental u.s. taxes.we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2018 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.18 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $3.09 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 was mostly due to an increase in net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expense.  cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities was $7.92 billion for the first nine months of 2018 and consisted of $9.61 billion of capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office buildings, offset by $1.84 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. the decrease in cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, was mostly due to a decrease in the net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $14.0 to $14.5 billion.cash used in financing activitiescash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2018 mostly consisted of $9.38 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock, and $2.66 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. the increase in cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, was mostly due to an increase in repurchases of our class a common stock.35off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of september 30, 2018.contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases, which include among others, certain of our offices, data center, land, and colocation leases, as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations. the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of september 30, 2018 (in millions):   payment due by period  total the remainder of 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 thereafteroperating lease obligations$12,389 $108 $1,599 $1,852 $8,830financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility(1)119 — 10 18 91other contractual

lease an office building that is currently under construction. as of september 30, 2018, $70 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. see note 8 of the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation.(2)other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure and our data center operations.as part of the normal course of the business, we may enter into multi-year agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. these agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $8.17 billion. the ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.  in addition, our other liabilities include $2.94 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of september 30, 2018. due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. as a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.contingencieswe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 8 — commitments and contingencies and note 10 — income taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.recently issued accounting pronouncementsin february 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis applied either to the earliest comparative period or at transition and early adoption is permitted. we will adopt the new standard effective january 1, 2019. we have selected and implemented a lease accounting system, and are in the process of validating the accuracy of the reports generated from the system and finalizing our accounting policy and use of optional practical expedients. while we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect all of our leases including our operating leases, as disclosed in note 8 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly 36report on form 10-q, will be subject to the new standard. we will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will increase our total assets and liabilities.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2017.on january 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1, 2018. results for reporting periods beginning after january 1, 2018 are presented under topic 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under topic 605. the impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements and there was no adjustment to beginning retained earnings on january 1, 2018. see note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding the adoption.37item 2.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsyou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2017, as filed with the securities and exchange commission. in addition to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, particularly in part ii, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this quarterly report on form 10-q.certain revenue information in the section entitled "—three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 and 2017—revenue—foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and nine months ended september 30, 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.executive overview of third quarter resultsour key user metrics and financial results for the third quarter of 2018 are as follows:user growth:•daily active users (daus) were 1.49 billion on average for september 2018, an increase of 9% year-over-year.•monthly active users (maus) were 2.27 billion as of september 30, 2018, an increase of 10% year-over-year.financial results:•revenue was $13.73 billion, up 33% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $13.54 billion, up 33% year-over-year.•total costs and expenses were $7.95 billion.•income from operations was $5.78 billion.•net income was $5.14 billion with diluted earnings per share of $1.76.•capital expenditures were $3.34 billion.•effective tax rate was 13%.•cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $41.21 billion as of september 30, 2018.•headcount was 33,606 as of september 30, 2018, an increase of 45% year-over-year.in the third quarter of 2018, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.we continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystems, facebook and instagram, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products that already have significant user bases, such as messenger and whatsapp, as well as continuing to grow features like stories, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we anticipate that additional investments in the following areas will drive significant year-over-year expense growth in 2018: (i) increased investments in safety and security, marketing, video content, and our long-term technology initiatives, and (ii) scaling our headcount and expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities to support our growth. expense growth exceeded revenue growth in the third quarter of 2018, which we anticipate will continue in the remainder of 2018 and 2019.24trends in our user metricsthe numbers for our key metrics, our daus, maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram, whatsapp, or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated.trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access facebook on mobile devices.•daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement on facebook. note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east. 25worldwide daus increased 9% to 1.49 billion on average during september 2018 from 1.37 billion during september 2017. users in india, indonesia, and the philippines represented key sources of growth in daus during september 2018, relative to the same period in 2017. •monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community on facebook.as of september 30, 2018, we had 2.27 billion maus, an increase of 10% from september 30, 2017. users in india, indonesia, and the philippines represented key sources of growth in the third quarter of 2018, relative to the same period in 2017.26trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in the third quarter of 2018 in the united states & canada region was more than ten times higher than in the asia-pacific region.note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the customer.27during the third quarter of 2018, worldwide arpu was $6.09, an increase of 20% from the third quarter of 2017. over this period, arpu increased by 30% in united states & canada, 29% in europe, 18% in asia-pacific, and 14% in rest of world. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.28components of results of operationsrevenueadvertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook, instagram, messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies and resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. we recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.payments and other fees. payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices, as well as revenue from various other sources.cost of revenue and operating expensescost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold, and amortization of intangible assets.research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, professional services such as content reviewers, as well as amortization of intangible assets.general and administrative. the majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include legal-related costs and professional services.29results of operationsthe following tables set forth our condensed consolidated statements of income data: three months ended september 30, nine months

nine months of 2018 increased $3.40 billion, or 33%, and $11.24 billion, or 41%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017. the increases were mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue.the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices. for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 92% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 88% and 87%, respectively, in the same periods in 2017. the increases in advertising revenue for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 were due to increases in the average price per ad and the number of ads delivered. during the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, the average price per ad increased by 7% and 19%, respectively, as compared with approximately 35% and 25%, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, and the number of ads delivered increased by 25% and 18%, respectively, as compared with approximately 10% and 20%, respectively, in the same periods in 2017. the increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory; factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement, and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products. we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads displayed.foreign exchange impact on revenuethe general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. if we had translated revenue for the three months ended september 30, 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $13.89 billion and $13.70 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, both revenue and advertising revenue would have been $159 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018.     foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our total revenue and advertising revenue in first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. if we had translated revenue for the nine months ended september 30, 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $38.18 billion and $37.63 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $749 million and $748 million lower than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the first nine months of 2018.31cost of revenue three months ended september

periods were due to increases in payroll and benefits expense as a result of a 45% growth in employee headcount from september 30, 2017 to september 30, 2018 in engineering and other technical functions and increases in professional service expenses. payroll and benefits expense growth in both periods were less than headcount growth partially due to the lapsing of acquisition-related

30,   2018 2017 % change 2018 2017 % change (in millions, except for percentages)provision for income taxes$775 $529 47% $2,160 $1,467 47%effective tax rate13% 10%   12% 11%  our provision for income taxes in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 increased $246 million, or 47%, and $693 million or 47%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017, mostly due to the new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (tax act) and an increase in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the enactment of the tax act.our effective tax rates in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 increased compared to same periods in 2017, primarily due to the new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, partially offset by the decrease in the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%.effective tax rate items. our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the united states and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate, as well as a number of other factors, including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the impact of changes in tax law.the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the u.s. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. if our stock price remains constant to the october 29, 2018 price, we expect our effective tax rates for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2019 will be in the mid-teens.integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods. on july 27, 2015, the united states tax court (tax court) issued an opinion in altera corp. v. commissioner (tax court opinion), which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. the tax court opinion was appealed by the commissioner to the ninth circuit court of appeals (ninth circuit). on july 24, 2018, the ninth circuit issued an opinion (ninth circuit opinion) that reversed the tax court opinion. the ninth circuit opinion was subsequently withdrawn and the case is being reheard. since the ninth circuit opinion was withdrawn, we continue to treat our share-based compensation expense in accordance with the tax court opinion. we also continue to monitor developments in this case and any impact the final opinion could have on our consolidated financial statements. had the ninth 33circuit not withdrawn its opinion, our effective tax rate for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2018 would have been higher.unrecognized tax benefits. as of september 30, 2018, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $2.94 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. these unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. based upon the status of litigation described below, the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, and excluding the effects of the altera corp. v. commissioner case that we are monitoring, we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months.in july 2016, we received a statutory notice of deficiency (notice) from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the irs prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice. as of september 30, 2018, we have not resolved this matter, and proceedings continue in the tax court. in march 2018, we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. the irs applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. if the irs prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed u.s. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. we do not agree with the positions of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice. we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the irs in the two notices. in addition, if the irs prevails in its positions, related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax act. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with asc 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. if the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.34liquidity and capital resourcesour principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.21 billion as of september 30, 2018, a decrease of $505 million from december 31, 2017, mostly due to $21.66 billion of cash generated from operations, offset by $9.61 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $9.38 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock, and $2.66 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $2.73 billion for the first nine months of 2018. as of september 30, 2018, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $6.50 billion, and we anticipate that none of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2018. as of september 30, 2018, we had $244 million of federal tax credit carryforward, of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2018. in addition, we are monitoring the altera corp. v. commissioner case as it applies to our facts and circumstances as it could increase our cash paid for income taxes.in may 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on may 20, 2021. as of september 30, 2018, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our class a common stock. we completed repurchases under this authorization during the second quarter of 2018. in april 2018, the authorization for the repurchase of our class a common stock was increased by an additional $9.0 billion. during the nine months ended september 30, 2018, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 54 million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $9.38 billion. as of september 30, 2018, approximately $3.54 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. in the first nine months of 2018, we paid $2.66 billion of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards.as of september 30, 2018, $13.61 billion of the $41.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. the tax act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. as a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the u.s. without incremental u.s. taxes.we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.cash provided by operating activitiescash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2018 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.18 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $3.09 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 was mostly due to an increase in net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expense.  cash used in investing activitiescash used in investing activities was $7.92 billion for the first nine months of 2018 and consisted of $9.61 billion of capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office buildings, offset by $1.84 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. the decrease in cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, was mostly due to a decrease in the net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $14.0 to $14.5 billion.cash used in financing activitiescash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2018 mostly consisted of $9.38 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock, and $2.66 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. the increase in cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, was mostly due to an increase in repurchases of our class a common stock.35off-balance sheet arrangementswe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of september 30, 2018.contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases, which include among others, certain of our offices, data center, land, and colocation leases, as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations. the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of september 30, 2018 (in millions):   payment due by period  total the remainder of 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 thereafteroperating lease obligations$12,389 $108 $1,599 $1,852 $8,830financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility(1)119 — 10 18 91other contractual

lease an office building that is currently under construction. as of september 30, 2018, $70 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. see note 8 of the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation.(2)other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure and our data center operations.as part of the normal course of the business, we may enter into multi-year agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. these agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $8.17 billion. the ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.  in addition, our other liabilities include $2.94 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of september 30, 2018. due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. as a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.contingencieswe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.see note 8 — commitments and contingencies and note 10 — income taxes in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, and "legal proceedings" contained in part ii, item 1 of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding contingencies.recently issued accounting pronouncementsin february 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis applied either to the earliest comparative period or at transition and early adoption is permitted. we will adopt the new standard effective january 1, 2019. we have selected and implemented a lease accounting system, and are in the process of validating the accuracy of the reports generated from the system and finalizing our accounting policy and use of optional practical expedients. while we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect all of our leases including our operating leases, as disclosed in note 8 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1 of this quarterly 36report on form 10-q, will be subject to the new standard. we will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will increase our total assets and liabilities.critical accounting policies and estimatesour condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2017.on january 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1, 2018. results for reporting periods beginning after january 1, 2018 are presented under topic 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under topic 605. the impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements and there was no adjustment to beginning retained earnings on january 1, 2018. see note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in part i, item 1, of this quarterly report on form 10-q for additional information regarding the adoption.37
