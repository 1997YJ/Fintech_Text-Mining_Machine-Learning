the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net sales were $81.7 billion and net earnings were $8.8 billion, or $7.63 per diluted share.our total store count was 2,286 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018. as of october 28, 2018, a total of 305 of our stores, or 13.3%, were located in canada and mexico. for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, total sales per square foot were $433.99 and our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times.we generated $10.0 billion of cash flow from operations during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. this cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to pay $3.5 billion of dividends, repay $1.2 billion of senior notes that matured in september 2018, fund cash payments of $5.5 billion for share repurchases, and fund $1.7 billion in capital expenditures.during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we repurchased a total of 28.5 million shares of our common stock for $5.5 billion through two asr agreements and open market transactions. in february 2018, we announced a 15.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.03 per share.our roic for the trailing twelve-month period was 42.2% at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018. see the "non-gaap financial measures" section below for our definition and calculation of roic, as well as a reconciliation of nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure.results of operationsthe tables and discussion below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and in the 2017 form 10-k and with our md&a included in the 2017 form 10-k. we believe the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in the associated dollar amounts, are relevant to an evaluation of our business.11table of contentsfiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 three month comparisons three months

2016.(2)does not include results for interline.sales. we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.net sales. net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 5.1% to $26.3 billion from $25.0 billion in the comparable prior-year period. the increase in net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions. in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized approximately $150 million of hurricane-related sales (the majority of which was attributable to the continuing impact of the 2017 fall hurricanes), compared with approximately $282 million of hurricane-related sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. a stronger u.s. dollar negatively impacted sales growth by $110 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. the adoption of asu no. 2014-09 also benefited net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by $64 million. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.comparable sales. comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excluding closed stores. retail stores become comparable on the monday following 12table of contentstheir 365th day of operation. acquisitions, digital or otherwise, are included after we own them for greater than 52 weeks (with the exception of interline, which is excluded from comparable sales for periods prior to fiscal 2018). comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap.total comparable sales increased 4.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. the increase, which was due in part to the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores and online, was driven by a 3.5% increase in comparable average ticket and a 1.2% increase in comparable customer transactions. the increase in comparable average ticket was primarily driven by sales in big ticket items, such as vinyl plank flooring, windows, appliances, and water heaters. total comparable sales in the third quarter of 2018 also reflected the impact of higher prior year hurricane-related sales. all of our departments, except for lighting, posted positive comparable sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. comparable sales for our appliances, electrical, plumbing, tools, décor, and flooring merchandising departments were above the company average in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. comparable sales for lighting were essentially flat primarily due to led price deflation. online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 7.5% of net sales and grew 28.1% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. gross profit. gross profit increased 5.8% to $9.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $8.6 billion in the comparable prior-year period. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 34.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. the increase in gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily reflected $147 million of benefit from the adoption of asu no. 2014-09, partially offset by higher supply chain and transportation costs.operating expenses. our operating expenses are composed of sg&a and depreciation and amortization.selling, general & administrative. sg&a increased 6.5% to $4.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $4.5 billion in the comparable prior-year period. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 18.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 18.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. the increase in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected an increase of $147 million from the adoption of asu no. 2014-09 and $131 million of incremental investments made in the business. these items were partially offset by expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment, continued expense control and the impact of higher prior year hurricane-related expenses.depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased 4.2% to $473 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $454 million in the comparable prior-year period. as a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.8% in the third quarters of both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, reflecting the offsetting effects of strategic investments in the business, leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment, and timing of asset additions. interest and other, net. interest and other, net, was $224 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $247 million in the comparable prior-year period. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 1.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. the decrease as a percent of net sales primarily reflected the impact of tax settlements and expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment. provision for income taxes. our combined effective income tax rate was 21.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 36.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. the decrease in the provision for income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the enactment of the tax act and adjustments to the provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.diluted earnings per share. diluted earnings per share were $2.51 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.84 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected a benefit of $0.37 per diluted share resulting from enactment of the tax act. 13table of contentsfiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 nine month comparisons nine months ended october

for further discussion. comparable sales. for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, total comparable sales increased 5.8%. this increase reflected a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy, broad-based growth across our stores and online, and the impact of hurricane-related sales from both the 2017 and 2018 hurricane seasons. during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, all of our departments, except for lighting, posted positive comparable sales. comparable sales for our appliances, electrical, lumber, tools, plumbing, décor and flooring product categories were above the company average for the first nine months of fiscal 2018. comparable sales for lighting were negative primarily due to led price deflation. our comparable store average ticket increased 4.7% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases. online sales represented 7.5% of net sales and grew 24.6% during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. 14table of contentsgross profit. for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, gross profit increased 7.1% to $28.1 billion from $26.3 billion in the comparable prior-year period. gross profit margin was 34.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to 34.1% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.  the increase in gross profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 primarily reflected $430 million of benefit from the adoption of asu no. 2014-09, partially offset by higher transportation and fuel costs in our supply chain. operating expenses. our operating expenses are composed of sg&a and depreciation and amortization. selling, general & administrative. sg&a increased 8.7% to $14.6 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, from $13.4 billion in the comparable prior-year period. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 17.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to 17.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. the increase in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reflected an increase of $430 million from the adoption of asu no. 2014-09 and $396 million of incremental investments made in the business, partially offset by expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and continued expense control.depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization was $1.4 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.3 billion in the comparable prior-year period. as a percent of net sales, it was unchanged at 1.7% for the first nine months of both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 and reflected offsetting effects of expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment, timing of asset additions, and certain investments.interest and other, net. for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, interest and other, net was $709 million compared to $737 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. as a percent of net sales, it was 0.9% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to 1.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. the decrease in interest and other, net as a percent of sales reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment, the impact of tax settlements and higher interest income, partially offset by higher senior notes interest expense.provision for income taxes. our combined effective income tax rate was 23.3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to 36.3% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. the decrease in the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the enactment of the tax act and adjustments to the provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.diluted earnings per share. diluted earnings per share were $7.63 for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to $5.76 for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 included a benefit of $1.16 per diluted share resulting from the enactment of the tax act.non-gaap financial measuresto provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.return on invested capital. we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. we define roic as nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. the calculation of roic, together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings (the most comparable gaap measure), follows.  twelve months endeddollars in millions october 28, 2018 october 29, 2017net earnings $10,556 $8,595interest and

pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.liquidity and capital resourcescash and cash equivalentsat october 28, 2018, we had $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.4 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets, cash flow generated from operations, and funds available under our commercial paper programs should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. as we accelerate our investments in the business within our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion in fiscal 2018.debt and derivativeswe have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings of up to $3.0 billion. all of our short-term borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $2.4 billion. in connection with these programs, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. our back-up credit facilities consist of a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in december 2022 and a 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in december 2018. at october 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities, and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. at october 28, 2018, there were $1.4 billion of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. we also issue senior notes from time to time.we use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on certain long-term debt. see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.share repurchasesin december 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 28.5 million shares of our 15table of contentscommon stock for $5.5 billion through two asr agreements and open market transactions. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the asr agreements.cash flows summaryoperating activities. cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, operations, and occupancy costs. net cash provided by operating activities increased $295 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year and was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, largely offset by net cash outflows associated with changes in working capital. the increase in net earnings during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was due to a lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 resulting from the enactment of the tax act, higher comparable sales, and expense leverage in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.investing activities. cash used in investing activities primarily reflected capital expenditures for investments in our business of $1.7 billion during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.4 billion of capital expenditures and $260 million for a business acquisition in the comparable prior-year period.financing activities. cash used in financing activities primarily reflected:•$5.5 billion of share repurchases, $3.5 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.2 billion of repayments of long-term debt in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, and•$6.1 billion of share repurchases and $3.2 billion of cash dividends paid in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term borrowings.critical accounting policiesthere were no changes during fiscal 2018 to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in the 2017 form 10-k. our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
