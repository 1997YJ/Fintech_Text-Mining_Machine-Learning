up 6% from the midpoint of the original business outlook we provided in april 2014 of $13.0 billion. the increase from q1 2014 was largely due to increased pc client group (pccg) and data center group (dcg) platform unit sales, driven by strength in the enterprise and small and medium businesses. this strength was fueled by several factors including an improved economic environment, a pc refresh, windows xp end of life, and the availability of new form factors. net revenue for the pccg operating segment was up 9% compared to q1 2014 and 6% compared to q2 2013, while net revenue for the dcg operating segment was up 14% and 19% over the same comparative periods. we had record net revenues in both our dcg operating segment of $3.5 billion and our internet of things group (iotg) operating segment of $539 million. for q3 2014, we are forecasting a revenue midpoint of $14.4 billion, up 4% from q2 2014. for full-year 2014, we are now expecting revenue growth of approximately 5%, which is higher than our original business outlook of approximately flat. 34intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)gross margin improved by almost 5 percentage points sequentially and 6 percentage points year-over-year. the increase from q1 2014 was largely due to lower factory start-up costs as we ramp our next generation 14-nanometer (nm) process technology and higher pccg and dcg platform (platform) unit sales in q2 2014. lower platform unit costs and lower pre-qualification product costs on our 14nm products also contributed to increased gross margin. these increases were partially offset by higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales and cash consideration provided to our customers associated with integrating our tablet platform. we are forecasting q3 2014 gross margin to be 66%, up 1.5 percentage points from q2 2014, due to lower platform unit costs, increased platform unit sales, partially offset by lower platform average selling prices. we are now forecasting full-year 2014 gross margin to be 63%, plus or minus a couple percentage points, up from our original business outlook of 61%. this increase is primarily driven by lower platform unit costs, higher platform unit sales, and partially offset by lower platform average selling prices.in q2 2014, our 5th generation intel® core™ processor family on 14nm process technology, code-named broadwell, qualified for sale. we expect the first 14nm processor-based systems, including fanless 2 in 1's, to be on shelves for the holiday selling season. our strong product portfolio continues to evolve as we expect to introduce several new products, across the market segments we serve, in the second half of 2014. in the data center market segment, we expect to launch our next generation xeon® processor e5 family platform on our 22nm process technology, code-named grantley, during q3 2014. in the wireless business, we are working towards qualification of our second generation lte solution, featuring cat6 and carrier aggregation, in early q3 2014. additionally, we expect to have our first integrated soc application processor and baseband 3g solution, code-named "sofia," available in q4 2014. finally, we are on track to achieve our 40 million unit sales goal for tablets in fiscal year 2014.our business continues to produce significant cash from operations, generating $5.5 billion in q2 2014. from a financial condition perspective, we ended q2 2014 with $17.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. during q2 2014, we purchased $2.8 billion in capital assets and returned cash to stockholders by paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing $2.1 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. with the cash generated from operations, we intend to increase our repurchases of common stock, and as a result reduce our cash balances. this is expected to enable sufficient liquidity for operations, while providing the strategic flexibility to invest in our business and continuing to return cash to our stockholders. in july 2014, the board of directors authorized an increase of $20 billion to the common stock repurchase program and we entered into a contract to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock in q3 2014, and are expecting additional stock repurchases in q4 2014. additionally, the board of directors declared a cash dividend in july 2014 of $0.225 per share of common stock to be paid in september 2014.our business outlook for q3 2014 and full-year 2014 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (research and development (r&d) plus marketing, general and administrative (mg&a)), and capital expenditures. we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release. our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations web site www.intc.com. this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-q. we expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet

3,500 employees. substantially all of the accrued restructuring balance as of june 28, 2014 relates to employee severance and benefits, which are expected to be paid within the next 12 months, and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated condensed balance sheets.since q3 2013, we have incurred a total of $458 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges. these charges included a total of $410 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 7,400 employees, and $48 million in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges. we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately$600 million, which will be realized within r&d, cost of sales, and mg&a. we began to realize these savings in q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in q2 2015.we may incur additional charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements, as well as facility-related or other exit activities, as we continue to align our resources to meet the needs of the business.gains (losses) on equity investments,

the increase in our effective tax rate between the first six months of 2014 and the first six months of 2013 was driven by the recognition of the full year of 2012 and first six months of 2013 portion

for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.for the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013, the $53 million decrease in cash provided by operations was due to changes in working capital, offset by higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items. the adjustments for non-cash items were higher in the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013 due to higher depreciation and restructuring and asset impairment charges. income taxes paid, net of refunds, in the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013 were $801 million higher due to 2012 income tax overpayments reducing income taxes paid in 2013.changes in assets and liabilities as of june 28, 2014, compared to december 28, 2013, included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits due to the payout of 2013 profit-dependent compensation and a decrease in inventories due to the sell-through of older-generation products, partially offset by the ramp of 5th generation intel core processor family products.for the first six months of 2014, our three largest customers accounted for 44% of net revenue (42% for the first six months of 2013) with hewlett-packard company accounting for 17% of our net revenue (16% for the first six months of 2013), dell inc. accounting for 16% of our net revenue (15% for the first six months of 2013), and lenovo group limited accounting for 11% of our net revenue (11% for the first six months of 2013). these three customers accounted for 44% of net accounts receivable as of june 28, 2014 (34% as of december 28, 2013).43intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)investing activitiesinvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.cash used for investing activities was lower for the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013. cash used for investing activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in purchases of trading assets and available-for-sale investments and an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments. this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets, higher investments in non-marketable equity investments, and higher capital expenditures.financing activitiesfinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.the increase in cash used for financing activities for the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program.liquiditycash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. as of june 28, 2014, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $17.3 billion ($20.1 billion as of december 28, 2013). in addition to the $17.3 billion, we have $2.2 billion of other long-term investments, $1.4 billion of loans receivable and other, and $385 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. most of our investments in debt instruments are in a/a2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated aa-/aa3 or better.another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, which was fully available for use as of june 28, 2014. this ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program. there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during the first six months of 2014. our commercial paper was rated a-1+ by standard & poor’s and p-1 by moody’s as of june 28, 2014. we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities.as of june 28, 2014, $11.2 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $11.2 billion held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, approximately $2.0 billion was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of june 28, 2014. the remaining amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no u.s. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the u.s. and future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities. we believe our u.s. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the u.s. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., such amounts would be subject to u.s. income taxes and applicable non-u.s. income and withholding taxes.we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, working capital requirements, dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.fair value of financial instrumentswhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. for further information, see “note 3: fair value” in the notes to consolidated condensed financial statements in this form 10-q.44intel corporationmanagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)marketable debt instrumentsas of june 28, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $18.6 billion of marketable debt instruments. of these instruments, $7.3 billion was classified as level 1, $11.2 billion as level 2, and $133 million as level 3.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. we evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.of the $11.2 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2, approximately 55% was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 45% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3, are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreementsas of june 28, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $802 million of loans receivable and $168 million of reverse repurchase agreements. all of these investments were classified as level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.marketable equity securitiesas of june 28, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.0 billion of marketable equity securities. substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.45
