service, enabled by differentiated staffing models, tools and organizational support. we also continued to connect our stores to our online properties, and our online properties to our stores, to provide a frictionless customer experience across all channels. in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we continued the roll out of interline's product catalog to our stores, which is now operational in over 1,500 u.s. stores, and the capability to accept payment that is linked to existing interline customer accounts. we also leveraged our digital assets to better understand our customers and meet their needs through targeted online offerings and localized online experiences. we simplified and expedited our online checkout process, effectively reducing our customers' 11table of contentscheckout time, and we are seeing increased sales, conversion rates and customer satisfaction scores. sales from our online channels increased 22.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year, and represented 6.6% of our total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.product authority – product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. we strive to be the leader in product authority, connecting products and services to the needs of our customers. in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our merchants continued to collaborate with our suppliers to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation – we drive productivity and efficiency through continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain. further, our disciplined capital allocation builds shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we continued to optimize the flow of products from suppliers to shelves and to our customers’ locations through project sync. this multi-year supply chain program is designed to create an end-to-end solution that will benefit all participants in our supply chain. we plan to continue to innovate our business model and value chain to support our productivity cycle and enhance overall value for customers throughout the year.in february 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. under the program, we repurchased a total of 8.5 million shares of our common stock for $1.2 billion through the open market during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. also in february 2017, our board of directors increased our targeted dividend payout ratio to 55% of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016.we opened two new stores in the u.s. and one new store in mexico during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, for a total store count of 2,281 at the end of the quarter. as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a total of 302 of our stores, or 13.2%, were located in canada and mexico.we generated $4.6 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. this cash flow was used to fund cash payments of $1.3 billion for share repurchases, pay $1.1 billion of dividends, repay $710 million of short-term debt and fund $458 million in capital expenditures.our inventory turnover ratio was 4.8 times at the end of the first quarter of both fiscal 2017 and 2016. our return on invested capital (defined as net operating profit after tax, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period) was 32.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 29.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. for a reconciliation of net operating profit after tax to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure, and our calculation of return on invested capital, see "non-gaap financial measures" below.12table of contentswe believe the percentage relationship between net sales and the major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of these items as well as the selected sales data presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. % of net sales  three months ended   april 30, 2017 may 1, 2016 % increase (decrease)in dollar amountsnet sales100.0 % 100.0 % 4.9%gross

quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 4.9% to $23.9 billion from $22.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. the increase in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 primarily reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by average ticket growth and increased customer transactions. the increase in net sales was partially offset by pressure from foreign currency fluctuations, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $71 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.total comparable store sales increased 5.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. comparable store sales for our appliances, lumber, flooring, tools, electrical, plumbing, décor, kitchen and bath, and indoor garden product categories were above or at the company average for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. further, our comparable store average ticket increased 3.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, flooring and roofing, offset in part by pressure from foreign currency fluctuations. our comparable store customer transactions increased 1.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.gross profit increased 4.7% to $8.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $7.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 34.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. the decrease in gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects the impact of product mix changes.selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 1.9% to $4.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $4.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 18.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 18.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and continued expense control.depreciation and amortization increased 2.5% to $444 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $433 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.9% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2017 and 2016. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.operating income increased 8.8% to $3.3 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $3.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. operating income as a percent of net sales was 14.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 13.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we recognized $241 million of interest and other, net, compared to $237 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2017 and 2016.our combined effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 36.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. the effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 included a $65 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for share-based payment awards as a result of the adoption of asu no. 2016-09. diluted earnings per share were $1.67 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $1.44 for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 included $0.05 of benefit as a result of the adoption of asu no. 2016-09. non-gaap financial measuresto provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.return on invested capitalwe believe return on invested capital ("roic") is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. we define roic as net operating profit after tax ("nopat"), a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. 14table of contentsthe following table provides our roic calculation and reconciles nopat to net earnings, the most comparable gaap

company's effective tax rate.(2)average debt and equity is defined as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.6 billion compared to $3.6 billion for the same period in fiscal 2016. this increase was primarily due to $268 million more in cash provided by the effective management of merchandise inventories, a $234 million increase in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses related to the timing of purchases and payments, and a $211 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage.net cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $445 million compared to $321 million for the same period in fiscal 2016. this change was primarily due to a $133 million increase in capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.net cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $3.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion for the same period of fiscal 2016. this change was primarily the result of $360 million more in repayments of short-term debt, $207 million more in cash dividends paid to stockholders and $132 million more in repurchases of common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. in connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in december 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. at april 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, all of our short-term borrowings were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.0 billion. as of april 30, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility.as of april 30, 2017, we had $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.15table of contentsrecent accounting pronouncementsfor a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements which may be applicable to us, see note 1 to the consolidated financial
