2018.during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we repurchased a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.0 billion through an asr agreement and open market transactions. in february 2018, we announced a 15.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.03 per share.we generated $4.0 billion of cash flow from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. this cash flow was used to pay $1.2 billion of dividends, repay $1.2 billion of short-term borrowings, fund cash payments of $1.1 billion for share repurchases, and fund $556 million in capital expenditures.our roic was 36.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. see the "non-gaap financial measures" section below for our definition and calculation of roic, as well as a reconciliation of nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure.11table of contentsresults of operationsthe tables and discussion below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and in our md&a included in our 2017 form 10-k. we believe the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in the associated dollar amounts, are relevant to an evaluation of our business. three months ended april 29, 2018 april 30,

include results for interline.first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to first quarter of fiscal 2017sales. we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.net sales. net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 4.4% to $24.9 billion from $23.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. the increase in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by a 5.8% increase in comparable average ticket and a benefit of $33 million resulting from the adoption of asu no. 2014-09, partially offset by a decline in customer transactions. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.comparable sales. comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-period of equivalent length. comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including 12table of contentsremodels and relocations) and excluding closed stores. retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 365th day of operation. acquisitions, digital or otherwise, are included after we own them for greater than 52 weeks (with the exception of interline, which is excluded from comparable sales for periods prior to fiscal 2018). comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap.total comparable sales increased 4.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. the increase in comparable sales reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores and online. online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 7.6% of net sales and grew 20.2% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. all of our departments, except for three, posted positive comparable sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. comparable sales for our appliances, electrical, lumber, décor, tools, plumbing, flooring, millwork, building materials, kitchen and bath, paint, and hardware merchandising departments were above or at the company average in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. comparable sales in our indoor and outdoor garden merchandising departments were negatively impacted by extreme winter weather in the quarter, while comparable sales for lighting were lower due to led price deflation.  our comparable average ticket increased 5.8% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain merchandising departments, such as appliances.gross profit. gross profit increased 5.7% to $8.6 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $8.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 34.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. the increase in gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily reflected $131 million of benefit from the adoption of asu 2014-09, expansion due to changes in product mix, and the benefit of recent acquisitions, partially offset by higher shrink and higher transportation costs in our supply chain.operating expenses. our operating expenses are composed of sg&a and depreciation and amortization.selling, general & administrative. sg&a increased 9.6% to $4.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $4.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 19.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 18.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. the increase in sg&a as a percent of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected an increase of $131 million from the adoption of asu 2014-09, and incremental investments made in the business, partially offset by expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and continued expense control.depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased 2.9% to $457 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $444 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales to 1.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from 1.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment.interest and other, net. interest and other, net, was $239 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $241 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for the first quarter of both fiscal 2018 and 2017 and primarily reflected higher interest expense resulting from higher short-term and long-term debt balances, partially offset by higher interest income.provision for income taxes. our combined effective income tax rate was 23.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 35.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. the decrease in the provision for income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the enactment of the tax act.diluted earnings per share. diluted earnings per share were $2.08 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.67 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected a benefit of $0.32 per diluted share resulting from the enactment of the tax act.non-gaap financial measuresto provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.return on invested capital. we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. we define roic as nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. 13table of contentsthe calculation of roic, together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings (the most comparable gaap measure), follows.  twelve months endeddollars in millions april 29, 2018 april 30, 2017net earnings $9,020 $8,168interest and other, net 981 940provision for income

adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate.additional informationfor information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.liquidity and capital resourcescash and cash equivalentsat april 29, 2018, we had $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $3.2 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets, and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing. as we accelerate our investments in the business within our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion in fiscal 2018.debt and derivativeswe have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. all of our short-term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were under these commercial paper programs, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.4 billion. in connection with these programs, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. our back-up credit facilities consist of a five-year $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in december 2022 and a 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in december 2018. at april 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities, and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. at april 29, 2018, there were $350 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. we also issue senior notes from time to time.we use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates on certain long-term debt. see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.share repurchasesin december 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.0 billion through an asr agreement and open market transactions. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the asr agreement.14table of contentscash flows summaryoperating activities. cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, operations, and occupancy costs.net cash provided by operating activities decreased $583 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year and primarily reflected increased merchandise inventory purchases, offset by an increase in net earnings, excluding changes in working capital and non-cash items from operations. the increase in net earnings resulted from higher comparable sales and expense leverage in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as a lower effective income tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 resulting from the enacting of the tax act.cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.investing activities. cash used in investing activities primarily reflected capital expenditures for investments in our business of $556 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and $458 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.financing activities. cash used in financing activities primarily reflected:•$1.2 billion of repayments of short-term borrowings; $1.2 billion of cash dividends paid; and $1.1 billion of share repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and•$1.3 billion of share repurchases; $1.1 billion of cash dividends paid; and $710 million of repayments of short-term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.critical accounting policiesour significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. there were no changes during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in the 2017 form 10-k.
